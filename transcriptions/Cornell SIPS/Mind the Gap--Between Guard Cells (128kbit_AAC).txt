[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 20 years or so, I've been
obviously doing a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_00]: photoreceptors and the phototropins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got kind of sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to talk about
today, because we discovered that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were some interesting things going on in
guard cells that, for us at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: were quite unexpected, perhaps not to
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll just continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about skeletal
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought I'd give a little bit of
early history.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, way back in 1836,
Charles Dalbany at Cambridge University
[SPEAKER_00]: did a very interesting experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you his experimental setup
in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he showed that blue light was much
better than red light in inducing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to lose water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my knowledge, this is the first
actual observation of a specific effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light on guards on skeletal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, obviously, he didn't know
anything about that at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 1898, Francis Darwin invented a
little device called a parameter and first
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated that light increased the rate
at which you could pull air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, indicative of some change in the
physical properties of the leaf that
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed more gas movement across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long assumed, however, despite this
experiment by Dalbany showing blue light
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so effective, it was assumed that
skeletal opening was strictly responding
[SPEAKER_00]: to photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after all, we have chloroplasts in
guard cells, so why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only much, much, much later
that Ogawa showed that blue light alone
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have much of an effect in
increasing transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But against a red light background,
the effect is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a huge increase in
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Zeiger and Field refined the
measurements and demonstrated that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: highly specific for blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know now, it's a response
mediated by the phototropins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here was Dalbany's very ingenious
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used various colored glass,
and he used also some solutions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And simply measured, he would put
concentrated sulfuric acid, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, hygroscopic, takes up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd weigh it, and then he would put
it under a bell jar and turn the light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he turned blue light on,
he got a much bigger increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time than if he turned the red light
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incidentally, he also noticed something
else, and that was that red light was far
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective than blue in inducing what
he described as the secretion of green
[SPEAKER_00]: matter into the leaves, which,
of course, was that he was seeing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time the development of chlorophyll
transformation of protochlorophyllide to
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyllide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the phytochrome responses
that follow that to get mature
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was just a nice piece of work that
got totally lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, the first report of a
blue light response, guard cell function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is Francis Darwin's
parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a leaf, and then you seal a
little suction cup there, and just hook it
[SPEAKER_00]: up to a duret like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you measure the rate at which the
liquid drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, if you turn the light on,
then the stomata open, the guard cells
[SPEAKER_00]: separate, and the rate at which it drops
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you turn the light off,
and it goes back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very elegant, very simple demonstration,
again, which has been pretty much lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, we identified phototropins,
and one of them, about one, eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: derailed it all with the first two and
identified the second phototropin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kinoshita et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Shimizaki's lab in Japan demonstrated
that both phot I and phot II mediate
[SPEAKER_00]: light-activated stomatal opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've come to the point where we
can actually identify the photoreceptors
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the light response first
described by Charles Dalbany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the last three decades or so,
we've learned a tremendous amount about
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal development, the number of
different people working on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the genes that are responsible,
the transcription factors involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also, another totally unrelated in
many ways, we've learned a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of the ion pumps and channels that
are involved in the stomatal opening and
[SPEAKER_00]: closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn now about the specific role of
abscisic acid in closing, but there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole lot of work that's been done on a
possible role of the cytoskeleton in
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal function, particularly not
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very nice studies from
Young-Seok Lee in Korea on actin changes
[SPEAKER_00]: with stomatal opening and closing,
and other papers since then, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me now digress slightly because we
got interested in stomata quite
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things happen to phototropin when you turn
the light on, and of course, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first things to happen is that you get
extensive phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing, we now know that you can get
binding of a 14-3-3 protein to a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular serine in phot II, highly
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that you can get
monounubiquitination here, probably other
[SPEAKER_00]: places too, according to Liskom,
and this is all we work that was done by a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term postdoc, Tungcheng Tseng in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's phototropin structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a serine-threonine kinase,
a classic serine-threonine kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have two domains of about 100
amino acids which bind to flavin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the chromophore, and both
phototropins have this structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn the light on saturation,
these are all the different amino acids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in blue were discovered by the
Japanese group, the ones in black were
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered by John Christie's group,
and the ones in red were ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time you do this, you pick up
different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just done another mass spec
experiment, and we've picked up three more
[SPEAKER_00]: that hadn't been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the number of phosphorylations
that occurs with light saturation probably
[SPEAKER_00]: is not yet completely identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, one of the things that
Tungcheng did was yeast-to-hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he found that FOT2 was associating
with the A1 subunit of a protein
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphatase, PP2A, and both by
yeast-to-hybrid and by pull-down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the question is, well,
is that phosphatase going to play a role
[SPEAKER_00]: in, actually can show that it was the love
domain that was apparently where the
[SPEAKER_00]: binding was occurring and not the kinase
domain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hypothesized that blue light would
induce phosphorylation, and with a
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type enzyme, then you could
inactivate, and so that this was a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivate the system after
photoactivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we hypothesized that if you had
an impaired phosphatase, then you should
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, at steady state, increase the
amount of the active phosphorylated FOT2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was clear that phosphorylation was
required for normal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, then we might
expect, first, phototropism might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive, and stomatal aperture at steady
state might be, in fact, wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we looked at phototropism,
sure enough, if we got rid of FOT1 so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adjusting FOT2 behavior,
in the impaired activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphatase, not only did we get a more
rapid phototropic response, but we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually got more curvature over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that indicated we then looked at guard
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't show you the quantitation,
but here's what it looks like when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: normally open.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the absence of functioning
phosphatase, with the mutant phosphatase,
[SPEAKER_00]: note that the guard cells are far wider
open than they are in the wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both cases, it appears that the
phosphatase is downregulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interaction with phototropin-2 affects
phototropism and stomatal aperture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no other FOT2-mediated response that
we tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all absolutely the same with or
without that mutation in the phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, PP2A, this same mutant,
had no impact whatsoever when what we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at was phototropin-1 function
instead of phototropin-2 function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so our second brush with guard
cells, that was our first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second brush with guard cells had to
do with another of Dongsheng's discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: from yeast-to-hybrid, and that is that
there's a 14-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lambda isoform interacts with
photoactive phototropin-2 at a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: serine, at serine 747.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, yeast-to-hybrid and pull-down
verified that there was a real
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see in this case that the
interaction is now downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with the kinase domain instead of
with the upstream love domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we found that the stomatal
opening was, in fact, severely impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's impaired, except that when we
can complement, put the wild type 14-3-3
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule back in, and we can restore
normal stomatal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it was even more highly
specific in that this is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon, the only phototropin-mediated
phenomenon that we could find that was
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired in the 14-3-3 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly specific to just that one
phosphorylation and dissociation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in 2007, Bill Eiseninger joined the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a longtime professor at Santertero
University where he didn't, it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lucky enough that he wanted to
continue doing research, so he joined the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was interested in guard cells,
and guard cells were affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: photoactivating phototropin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our interests were pretty much in
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also I had a colleague, Dave Erhart,
who had plenty of our rabidopsis that was
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying GFP tubulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided it would be fun to look at
the behavior of the microtubules in guard
[SPEAKER_00]: cells as they closed or opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Dave, we have very,
very good confocal microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the initiation of this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, there's this very
large literature on osmotic regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Mike Blatt, Sally Asman,
Julian Schroeder, and a number of others,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only a limited amount of information
about the possible role of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, schemes like this have
been developing, and I find them
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable barely, a bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what Bill first saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are guard cells now expressing GFP
tubulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the tubulin is in hoops
around the perimeter of the guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is for the guard cell wide
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we treat with ABA, which induces
closure, a couple of things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you see there are lots and lots of
these microtubules, and it turns out that
[SPEAKER_00]: the brighter ones are probably bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, the number of those bundles
that you can actually resolve decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there's been a loss in total
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is interesting because the
monomer of tubulin is just as fluorescent,
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP, as is the polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a net loss of tubulin,
a rather significant loss of tubulin over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you correlate stomatology and
storm middle aperture with the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things that you can count,
you see that there's a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship there, a pretty clean
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they close, the number of
aperture closes, and the time course for
[SPEAKER_00]: the loss in structures that you can
resolve goes down simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take these plants,
when they're closed, put them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: light to the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They close, the number of elements that
you can count goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back in the light, they open,
and simultaneously up come the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: those bundles that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why the decline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe less growing ends of the
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have the same number of growing
ends, but they're growing more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could account for some of the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have more rapid degradation at
the minus ends, or some combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the growing ends,
and let's hope that this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna be able to look at the
growing ends by looking at a different
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is N-binding-1-GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a protein that's found at the
growing ends of microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's hope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see now, this is just watching in
time-lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the growing ends of those
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having this, you can do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, in the first place, you can count
the number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, you can measure the rate at
which they're moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would tell us maybe more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're moving in a circular
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to tell whether they're
going under or over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that there are some going in both
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't studied that in any great
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, if we now look at the number,
as the guard cells close following ABA
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, it reduces closing very nicely,
but it doesn't change the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: comets, these little comets that you see
flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of growing ends doesn't
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just showing the pavement cells
along with the guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at the velocity,
closed versus open, there's no difference
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going just as fast, and they're
just as many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're left with the conclusion that
they're actually undergoing differential
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation at their minus ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the question then becomes,
well, do microtubules play a major role in
[SPEAKER_00]: still middle opening and closing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're appearing when they open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're disappearing when they close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do they play a function of role,
or is this just simply something passive
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens as a consequence of opening
and closing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ways of testing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arisolin that we can use, or I think
coccicine does that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Arisolin destabilizes microtubules,
and Taxol stabilizes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can try these drugs and see what
effect they have on opening and closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this experiment, we're starting
with them initially in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting the leaves into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either Visha or Arabidopsis,
you can see that the guard cells open.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if we have treated with
Arisolin, these structures don't reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this is just sort of messy
inside the cell, and they don't open.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if we treat with Taxol,
they do open, and they open relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we now do the reverse experiment,
going from light to dark, normally they
[SPEAKER_00]: would close in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Arisolin, of course, they do close,
and you've got this same sort of mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Taxol, they're stuck open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conclude, therefore, that the
microtubule changes that we observed on
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal opening and closing, these
changes are required for normal stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions you might ask is,
well, we've transformed these plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: put different stuff into the guard cells
than was there naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just maybe we've interfered with
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a classic water loss
experiment done with colleagues in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological physiology group at Carnegie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what type or any of these
transformants, they're all behaving
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then Bill decided to try to get a
little more quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the early pictures looked like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could then draw a line and scan across
and get a little profile of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's from the lower cell and here from
the top cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could do some experiment such
as this, where when you went into AVA with
[SPEAKER_00]: open guard cells, you noticed that the
high peaks gradually declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they're virtually all gone after
whatever that is, 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the pavement cells,
there's no particular change.
[SPEAKER_00]: He then got more sophisticated,
or I should say the equipment got more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a better image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can take this and rotate it so
that you're now looking at the ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules and the fluorescence from the
GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can draw a line here and do a
scan and you get something that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sort of squint at this,
you could convince yourself that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some peaks that are down in here,
some peaks that are around in here and
[SPEAKER_00]: some peaks that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this isn't going to be a uniform
series from small to large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there'll be discrete steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, but for this particular one,
you don't see that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every once in a while, we'd get
something that looked like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one clearly was having a series of
increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we interpret this as an increase in
bundling as the total number doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: decline all that much when they close,
going down to here, going down to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the number of high peaks drops down
and it drops down stepwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we interpret that as a decrease in
bundling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going from singles here to doubles,
to triples, to quadruples, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this accounts for the difference in
the brightness of the fluorescence that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see in those various structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now, tilbinin, as I mentioned,
doesn't lose its fluorescence as a
[SPEAKER_00]: monomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the possibilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that the loss of fluorescence
is likely due to proteolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, then if we treat with
something that will inhibit proteolysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: just maybe we can block the, block
stomatal closing and inhibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, COP1 is an E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the COP1 mutation, COP1 is involved in
all kinds of things going on in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was known that the COP1 mutation
prevented stomatal closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might also prevent the fluorescence
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a couple of experiments that
we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing is, if we inhibit
proteolysis with Mg132, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the, I don't have my glasses on,
but I assume that that's, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the stomatal aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, indeed they do not close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at fluorescence,
the Mg132 also very much impairs the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That essentially reflects photobleaching
that occurs under any circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see that in DMSO,
we go into ABA, we lose the structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if we have Mg132 present,
these guard cells don't change
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the appearance of the
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it turns out that a lot more than
just proteolysis is involved in closing
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can inhibit transcription or
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another protease inhibitor besides
Mg132.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you inhibit transcription or
translation, you prevent the closing
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction and they remain open in ABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a 40 minute treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on that at least we
hadn't expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is what about COP1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, COP1, as I mentioned, doesn't close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incidentally, if you look at COP1 guard
cells, notice that they're more nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: circular than the, wild type guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And note that in COP1, ABA, you can hammer
them and you can't get them to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are essentially stuck open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are they stuck open,
but the microtubules are not changed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the ABA treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's consistent with what
we've seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this shows the, that's the,
stomatal aperture unchanged in COP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the, this is the fluorescence
in COP1 with the controls here,
[SPEAKER_00]: no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the bleaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the, in the wild type COP1
protein, you see the fluorescence loss
[SPEAKER_00]: again, plus ABA over the same time course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we disrupt COP1-6 guard cell
microtubules from the arysin, can we get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to close?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried that experiment and sure
enough, if we treat them with arysin,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do indeed close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is, I've now switched to some
work by Roginus Kenna who joined the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: about three years ago on, on full-time and
then a part-time basis and is still
[SPEAKER_00]: working with us on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that if you treat now with
arysin, the COP1 guard cells, not only do
[SPEAKER_00]: they lose their microtubules, but they
also close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now of course that could be simply,
we may, maybe we just killed the cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if we try to wash it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's just a quantitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one to look at is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darker light with arysin in COP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: They close there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, did we just kill the cells or in
fact, can we recover them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do a washout, the microtubules
structures reappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they open back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't just killed the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's, it's fairly good evidence
that these microtubule changes are indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: essential for opening and closing guard
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question then becomes,
does the COP1 mutation in any way affect
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophysiology of the guard cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after all, they do have to get
driven by osmotic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium has to move in for opening and
all these other things have to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, we started a collaboration
with Julian Schroeder's lab at UCSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Lin Lee was a postdoc there who
did these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the thing I showed you at the
very start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two important channels that
are worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this potassium channel,
which is essential for opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a slow anion channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a slow anion channel,
which is right here, which is required for
[SPEAKER_00]: closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is a very much
oversimplified diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another more recent one,
but for me, it was just absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose the simple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So required for closing, required for
opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the behavior of
those two channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's what happened when John Lin
looked at the potassium channel at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In wild type, this is the behavior that
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the usual experiment voltage current
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that in COP1, it's
absolutely normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no impact whatsoever in COP1 on
the potassium channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to our surprise, when we looked then
at SLAC1, the slow anion channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was completely dead in COP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, its behavior in the COP1 mutant
was about the same as what you'd expect in
[SPEAKER_00]: a SLAC1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was essentially non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that raises the question,
what's the interaction between SLAC1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these microtubule studies in COP1?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, what is the role of these
changes in stomatal function?
[SPEAKER_00]: Structurally, do they provide some sort of
structural contribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all that strong to be able to
have a role in changing the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're transporting vesicles to and
from the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that these cells are expanding
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our experience, in COP1, for example,
where there seems to be no closure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pair of guard cells forms something
that's almost circular, but a circular
[SPEAKER_00]: pore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in wild type, the arrangement is a
bit more elliptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pore is smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's as if there's a balance between
opening processes and closing processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives you some sort of interim
intermediate state of opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, in the presence of COP1,
we kill the closing process, then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: only seeing the consequence of the opening
processes, and they are at their most
[SPEAKER_00]: distended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, they're in an almost circular
conformation as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you expand these cells,
and we can argue about this later,
[SPEAKER_00]: later on when we're chatting about shape
and so forth, it appears that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the outer surface,
the area of the guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means that one of two things,
either if you're going to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area at all, either you have to
make it thinner or you have to add
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so could it be that the role of these
microtubules is to transport vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: containing proteins and more membrane
material for fusion with the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane, transport two on opening and
remove on closing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the ways to look at that then
would be to look at what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between these changes in
SLAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get a SLAC1 fluorescent label,
we could follow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to do that, and these are
our most recent experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is SLAC1 GFP, and it's in the COP1
mutant, so that these guys are wide open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that the SLAC1,
as you would expect of a channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty much localized to the periphery
of the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not much in the interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you now look at, again,
these are very preliminary pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that the arrangement, in the first
place, it's near the meridian of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, and it's more there than it is on
the upper and lower surfaces, the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the air and the surface towards
the interior of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's showing some kind of
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, when they're open like
this, does that structure coincide in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way with the microtubules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would at least be a lead that
things, that the microtubules could be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in moving stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does it look like when they're
closed?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it looks like, if we now,
this is in the COP1 for a mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we now treat it with a risolin and
close it, remember, we can close it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can treat it with washing out and
get it to open again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's shown on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the distribution change with stomatal
opening and closing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using COP1 as our test system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the change is really
rather dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're open, the SLAC1 GFP is mostly
peripheral at the plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas when they're closed, it now is
very much internalized in what appear to
[SPEAKER_00]: be vesicles of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nature of which, at the moment,
we simply don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I say, these are all very recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so what the next step now,
and one which we're just starting,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to get plants that are expressing both
a fluorescent SLAC1 and a fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: tubulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since what we had was, in both cases,
GFP, that wasn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had to work now with different
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally have just gotten some plants
that are expressing M.
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry tubulin, which is a red
fluorescent, and SLAC1 GFP, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: green fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's last week's picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the M.
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry tubulin and the SLAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are almost closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the picture here, of course,
is just sort of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the very first picture
demonstrating that we do, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: have done double-labeled,
fluorescent-labeled plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be able to take a look
and do time course studies and watch and
[SPEAKER_00]: see whether, indeed, the microtubules are
involved in moving vesicles around,
[SPEAKER_00]: containing SLAC1, and who knows what else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our operating, our working
hypothesis at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I have to say, there's
clearly a lot more to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to a lot of neat
pictures in the next six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I mentioned Tongchun,
who did that earlier work looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: post-translational modification of
phototropin on photoexcitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Isinger, who did the initial work on
microtubules, and then Raj Nish,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this more recent stuff,
our collaboration with Julian Schroeder
[SPEAKER_00]: with special thanks to John Lin for making
the electrophysiological measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're halfway up the mountain,
but we still have 600 meters to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: there from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a different mountain,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot more to do, and people
are going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we're going to be busy for a good
while longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And support came from both Carnegie and
from the National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's largely in the anticlineal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other pictures of that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a sort of a band of it around
the anticlineal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we'll have time with the
subsidiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those comets may be bringing...
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in a position that,
not with my skills, but with David
[SPEAKER_00]: Erhart's and Raj Nish's, we might be able
to probe that and find out whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the question is whether the
hypothesized vesicles that are going back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth could have some impact on the
physical properties of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my gut feeling is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to reject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of hand, but I think it's
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the microtubules start out as
being... As the guard cells develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the microtubules are what
determine where the microfibrils are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this function that we're
hypothesizing is a later one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a function for a mature cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways of testing that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways of testing the elastic
module of a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen papers on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something we thought about but
haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very interesting to test just
that notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the techniques are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we have the skill to use them
properly or not, remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get NSF money for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you looked at the effect of blue
light?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think David Erhart's seen blue
light affecting microtubule stability in
[SPEAKER_04]: cells in the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a really elegant reorientation of
the microtubules in the hypocotyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is clearly related to the change in
the growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we see specifically is that in
blue light, the microtubules increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: number and very much increase in bundling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a blue light response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other photoreceptors will modulate that
response, but without the phototropins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get any light sensitivity at all
for stomatal opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it takes about 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty of time for a lot else
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have said something misleading when
I said the COP1 is involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of the microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it could be involved in the
degradation of something else that then
[SPEAKER_00]: plays, you know, it could be much more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's purely correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that the fluorescence decline
parallels the time course for closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, these are happening on a time
scale of many, many minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time resolution simply isn't good
enough to say more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it looks as if they're
closely correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better time resolution might show that
that's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it caught me up because I tend to be
much too confident when I talk about COP1
[SPEAKER_00]: and proteolysis and microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have to be that the primary
event could be indirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that for the
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are these ubiquitination
studies in a prototropin itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I can't address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we simply haven't looked at that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's the length of the guard cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be 100th the width of the
cell, a micron or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bundles are going to be bigger than
that, the singles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our earlier experiments, the resolution
wasn't good enough to see singles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we thought we were actually
losing a large number of the structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually only losing a small number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going from multiples to singles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for a wonderful
seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
