[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well good afternoon everyone and it sounds
like I am between this group and a break
[SPEAKER_00]: and would certainly like to thank the
opportunity for Cornell to having Bayer as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as myself join your presentation
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mark Foster and I'm with Bayer
Crop Science and our seed growth business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with Bayer for roughly 22 years
in both the Canadian and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses as well as across both the row
crop business and our veg organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as introduced I'm going to talk a
little about how Bayer Crop Science
[SPEAKER_00]: positions themselves when we're thinking
about seed treatments and the various
[SPEAKER_00]: components that go into our thought
process about bringing products to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost who is Bayer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well of course we're a multinational
company with a focus on seed, trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really when you start to think about
the seed growth perspective of course we
[SPEAKER_00]: really encompass all of these things that
we're talking about on this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have wholly owned seed brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark I'm not seeing you share your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay hopefully you're seeing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Bayer we do focus through the
components of our go-to-market strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inclusive of seed, traits, chemistry and
biologicals and target them for both an
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream use pattern as well as a
downstream use pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're focusing on any type of
innovation really the vision is driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: ensuring that the products that we're
searching for offer value to our
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they can be utilized in sustainable
means and then also have an ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization as we look at more data-driven
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're thinking about seed growth
there's a lot of things that go into this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of innovation and investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly number one in order for a customer
to want to do business with any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: company is to provide innovation and
uniqueness within their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is of course utilizing some
technologies and formulations that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly adapted for many different types
of use patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you all know there's many different
types of treating systems out there with
[SPEAKER_00]: varying degrees of sophistication and the
ability to apply them correctly is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to require some adaptable formulations
that can make them work in varying
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads us to application technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a wholly owned division within
Bayer that builds on treater application
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and seed treaters based in
Shakopee Minnesota I'll talk about here
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly from a customer service
perspective it's definitely critical that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to service the products that
you bring to market and making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer experience is a positive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our standpoint the customer is
not only the person selling the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment that we sell the seed treatment
to whether that be a seed company or
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor but also through to the person
who's actually doing the application and
[SPEAKER_00]: then ultimately to the farmer who is
seeing success with utilizing the product
[SPEAKER_00]: from an efficacious perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly when we're thinking about the
marketplace as mentioned we are a provider
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed within the global marketplace and
one of our largest customers at Bayer
[SPEAKER_00]: CropScience is our wholly owned brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us a great opportunity to test
run the formulations that we need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they can be applied correctly
and in addition to it gives us an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to make sure that customers
are able to see a pathway to utilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only though are we a seed company we
are a chemistry provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed growth space is a very small
world where there's to date a finite
[SPEAKER_00]: number of active ingredients and we also
want to make sure that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to work with other providers
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned we're an equipment
manufacturer and ultimately the success of
[SPEAKER_00]: our products rely on application being
successful as well and the investment that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have in creating application technology
that's sustainable and efficient is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly making sure that we have
end use confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just to maybe focus on what is an
example of success and why these things
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little bit more complicated in this
top right hand corner you see some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we're really trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example of a soybean seed treatment
we're really looking at roughly eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: nine different components in very small
scale that we're applying to a seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to have the expression of efficacy
to control varying degrees of pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: promote growth in the case of biologicals
to be illustrated within a farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start to talk about these seven,
eight or even up to nine different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of products that we're putting on the seed
being able to do so on a finite amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate within the seed is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the development example through
equipment you can see a picture of a Bayer
[SPEAKER_00]: on demand treater which allows for varying
components to be applied to specific seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: at a very controlled rate and a very
quantifiable rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see a closed system that
doesn't allow for significant exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: the user and it's ultimately a clean means
of doing so while relying on loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight measurements to ensure accuracy
that the amount of seed treatment that is
[SPEAKER_00]: being applied to those particular
components is being done in an accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we have many of those components
and we have ways to apply them in an
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate means we also have to make sure
that when we do put it into the drum of
[SPEAKER_00]: the treater that the treatment itself goes
onto the seed and not become sticky within
[SPEAKER_00]: the bowl or within the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So success at the end of the day is really
having that product that you're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: go from the chemistry jugs onto the seed
and not being upheld by the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the application means.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step of course is then taking it
from that treater and putting it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the planter and in a means of testing you
want to make sure that all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: varying components still allow flow
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bridge up within a planting
system which ultimately creates time and
[SPEAKER_00]: costly efforts on behalf of farmer in
order to get that planted seed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly of course the proof is
always in the results and when we do get
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed into the field we want to make
sure that the products do control the
[SPEAKER_00]: pests that they perform and say that they
will control and ultimately lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer being set up for a successful
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from a four pillar type of approach it
really all starts with the formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working with and as we're
considering these things we have full
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations inclusive of fungicides,
insecticides, adding seed coatings and
[SPEAKER_00]: finishers so things like fluency agent
advance to ensure that we have flow
[SPEAKER_00]: ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned the previous speaker by a lot
of the logicals are also added to the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation and into the actual
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately making sure that the
formulation is stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we can ship
these products to the applicator and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be able to maintain their
longevity and be able to manage some more
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse conditions such as higher heat
temperatures or lower temperatures to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid freezing and thawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately maintaining their viability
to make sure they can be used effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly the other pathway to that is
through custom blends which is ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: the layering of individual assets in fully
formulated means one on top of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: and then can be mixed together for an
application at point of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're thinking about that application
means we do run all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: through our labs and then at a pilot scale
in our research facility and then we move
[SPEAKER_00]: it on to a full-fledged scale treater at a
pilot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our labs are located in St. Louis do this
on a small scale to ensure proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept and then in our pilot facilities
we have scaled down versions of full-size
[SPEAKER_00]: treaters to make sure that they do work in
either a batch treatment or a continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: flow type of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the final step is to take it to
commercial treaters and as mentioned we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that while we build seed treaters
ourselves at our supplier we want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they have functionality with a
vast array of application technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: that do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're doing all of these things
we're first and foremost considering seed
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting these chemistries on the seed it's
important that they don't hurt the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of the seed from a germination
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned by your previous speaker we
want to make sure that the chemistries can
[SPEAKER_00]: work together and don't necessarily have
antagonism when they're mixed together in
[SPEAKER_00]: a slurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formulating recipe creations in
utilization of those coatings and
[SPEAKER_00]: finishers and then ensuring that we have
field testing that has been accomplished
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure that they work correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an equipment perspective this varies
anywhere from what I've called inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag as well as some outside the bag type
of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial of course is when upstream
companies or seed companies are applying
[SPEAKER_00]: the product for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally this is a means professional
application and then the formulations also
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to work in an outside the
bag or downstream mentalities which is
[SPEAKER_00]: very common in soybeans and cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately this equipment we want to make
sure is accurate, can be applied in a safe
[SPEAKER_00]: means from a stewardship perspective and
then from a sustainability component that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're applied in a means that put the
seed treatment on the seed and that
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly a full service portfolio
is important whether that be from the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the product in our field
solutions organizations or technology
[SPEAKER_00]: development all the way through to
ensuring that the customer has a very
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied product in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just a couple more slides here that I
wanted to go through as to a bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity on the formulation development.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we take for granted
is ultimately we're trying to put as many
[SPEAKER_00]: solids as we possibly can into a liquid
and make sure that they will still pump
[SPEAKER_00]: and then hold themselves to the seed once
it's applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see within a formulation the
active ingredient portion is really about
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarter of it and beyond that you have
several other components that make the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation of viable products be utilized
whether that be pigments or buffers,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-foaming agents or de-dusting agents
and really getting the mix of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products correct is really what's going to
ultimately have the best utilization for
[SPEAKER_00]: your end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active ingredient of course you're
working on making sure that it is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the pest or promote the growth
that you're actively intending to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a disbursement we're making sure that
it will stay in the means of liquid that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to be staying in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately from water and salt
solvent and filler that's to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will flow within the certain
formulation that you've built as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: then adding adjuvants and rheological aids
to make sure that they do perform in means
[SPEAKER_00]: of suspension and application that you're
searching to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately as mentioned you can see the
varying different types of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're attempting to do and whether that
be adding solids to liquids or oils it's
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult to do in a
concentrated means that is still able to
[SPEAKER_00]: be utilized by our end customer through
the application means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after we've got that formulation built
I'd mentioned the next element is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we can apply these products in a
way that is going to ensure that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: good stewardship as well as proper
efficacy of the product ending up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: intended active ingredient load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different types of means are done but a
couple of core measurements for us are
[SPEAKER_00]: ensuring that dust and dust off is well
under control with the formulations and if
[SPEAKER_00]: any tweaks would need to be done through D
dusters or additions for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here from an
application standpoint in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: left-hand corner is particularly when you
get to on-farm applications not all seed
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is necessarily industrial grade if
you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make sure your formulation
is able to be optimized to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: varying degrees of seed quality going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in the bottom corner
we've attempted to work with both highly
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned conditioned seed and then some
stuff that is maybe a little bit more or I
[SPEAKER_00]: should say less refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've put the product on the seed
we run it through some seed flowability
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately this is to ensure that it
doesn't bridge when it's within its
[SPEAKER_00]: planting technology or going through the
process of getting the seed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely a pain point for
consumers if they do experience any of
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of issue and in particular in
the planting situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that the viscosity can
change of that seed after we apply these
[SPEAKER_00]: products to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed flowability is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing I just talked
about is the coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensuring that there is enough liquid
and application technology to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have ideal coverage to the entire seed
as some of these products are more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: contact rather than a systemic and it's
important to make sure that you have good
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage of every opportunity of that
particular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly I just want to talk a bit about
our equipment focus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've certainly seen tremendous innovation
when it comes to equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bayer has of course mentioned we have
upstream type of application equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: through commercial plants but there's also
a need for downstream type of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly in the top left hand corner
you see examples of probably a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more unorganized type of treatment
location and we could probably all agree
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's some things that we'd rather
not see in that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below that is the Bayer on demand which
controls the amount of chemistry being
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the seed but it's also a closed
system opportunity where it's just really
[SPEAKER_00]: done through the pumping stands and loss
and flow measurement of the chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: being applied through the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of technology is all done in the
Shakopee location where there's a 135,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot facility built to construct
both upstream and downstream equipment of
[SPEAKER_00]: varying levels of control and scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very fortunate to have this
investment to be able to utilize the top
[SPEAKER_00]: to bottom integration of creating a
formulation but also being able to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The core elements of the equipment
business is really from application
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity as well as utilizing the
formulation to make sure it goes through
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our true areas of emphasis are on
stewardship, user safety and then value
[SPEAKER_00]: assurance that the product is going onto
the seed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly from a regulatory
compliance, it is very important that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use these products at the appropriate
rates and be mindful that they do get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really in summation from a customer
success standpoint, our goal here at Bayer
[SPEAKER_00]: is to have products that move from a
plantability perspective, have user
[SPEAKER_00]: safety, have considered stewardship
considerations and then offer value to
[SPEAKER_00]: customers through efficacious approaches
to insects and diseases as well as offer
[SPEAKER_00]: means of applying varying biological
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm gonna maybe hit pause
and see if there's any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
