[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, my title today is A Time for
Barley to Go Naked After 10,000 Years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was a subtitle to this
presentation, it would be the conclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: of another man after a life with Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because I have spent the last
30 years, my professional life,
[SPEAKER_01]: working on Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a book, a real book,
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not Photoshopped, called One Man's
Life with Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a much better book than anything
I could write.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's by Harry Harlan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the pioneering plant
explorers and traveled the world and was
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for, I think, a lot of the
vision that we have for conservation of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant genetics resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have a chance to get a copy
of One Man's Life with Barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd encourage you to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me dissect the title a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't intended to be at all sort of
the kind of thing to bring people out
[SPEAKER_01]: after lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, let's just do Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's Barley, for those of you not
familiar with it, it is Hordeum vulgar,
[SPEAKER_01]: subspecies vulgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see it often referred to as just
Hordeum vulgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But technically, we should use the
subspecies because it is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: interfertile with its wild ancestor,
which is subspecies spontaneum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a diploid, has a large genome size,
has that sort of average number of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is kind of all that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all important in the breeding and
genetics and so forth of this organism
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's highly tolerant of
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a consequence, we see primarily
pure line varieties throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been kind of on and off
attempts at hybrid production in Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those really haven't caught on until
recently Syngenta has been marketing some
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid feed Barleys in Europe with some
considerable success.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still public and private plant
breeding in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my colleague Mark Sorrels and
students on his project are still Barley
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and wheat breeders and so forth
at universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had a much greater presence of the
private sector in cereals breeding in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last several years here in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rest of the world, really,
then it's a private venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Barley and wheat have long since
gone down the road that we've seen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US with corn and soybeans and other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get to the naked part of the
title here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the naked in this case refers to the
adherence of the lemma and palea to the
[SPEAKER_01]: karyopsis, to the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they adhere, then you have what
is called a covered Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't adhere, they're
non-adhering, you have what we'll call a
[SPEAKER_01]: naked Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to use this naked
nomenclature after Takeda et al here,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are the ones who cloned this gene and
then reported it in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by saying naked and covered,
you just get around this real messy kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of grammatical semantic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you want to say that a Barley
doesn't have a hull, is it hull-less with
[SPEAKER_01]: a hyphen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it hull-less with just two Ls?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's complicated and further
complicated by the fact that if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: hull-less, then what is the alternative in
its hull which can be misconstrued to
[SPEAKER_01]: sound as though it has had its hull
removed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just easier to say covered and
naked, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hence the terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gene abbreviation is nude for nudum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the covered form right here,
where we have the adhering lemma and
[SPEAKER_01]: palea, is dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is indeed the wild and ancestral
condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Takeda and his group cloned this,
they identified this as an ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene response factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mechanism by which it works is
that there is or is not the formation of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lipid layer between the lemma and palea
and the pericarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the lipid forms, then the lemma and
palea sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the layer doesn't form,
then it threshes clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you folks who are familiar with
wheat and other grains that thresh clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is like no surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like, well, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought all grains were that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley is rather unique in being a major
cereal crop, the fourth most important in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, that actually has a tightly
adhering hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll kind of see some of the
reasons why that has transpired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now to the 10,000 year part of the
title here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Barley originated, as did so many of
our other crops and domesticated animals,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Fertile Crescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you saw a dispersal of Barley
from that ancestral site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of key traits that
are part of that domestication syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the naked covered phenotype is one of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly shattering or the brittle
rachis is characteristic of the subspecies
[SPEAKER_01]: spontaneum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a picture of it in the next slide
here that just facilitates seed dispersal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you definitely want the
non-shattering, non-brittle rachis in
[SPEAKER_01]: vulgar, the domesticated sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spontaneum is a two row.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you not familiar with
Barley's, two row means you have a single
[SPEAKER_01]: row of kernels on either side of the
spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a fertile flora at every
rachis node.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a six row, then you have
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ancestral form is two, and the
post-domestication form is six.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spontaneum, the ancestral sort,
has an adhering hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that was a wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dominant allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are adhering and non-adhering
hulls within vulgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of growth habit, something we
really won't get into today but that is
[SPEAKER_01]: very near and dear to my heart,
then you have just winter annuals in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hordium spontaneum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have winter, facultative,
and spring annual types present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, of course, gives us this kind of
apparent situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that appearances can be
deceiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be my only political illusion
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of them is it seems that we have
much greater diversity over here in vulgar
[SPEAKER_01]: than we do in the spontaneum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, of course, it's quite the
reverse because we had a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary bottlenecks along the way
where we've lost allelic diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: vulgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a very active area of
research is to go back and start to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in or mine some of those alleles
that may have been lost in the
[SPEAKER_01]: domestication process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of the brittle rachis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've never encountered this,
you've probably encountered brittle rachis
[SPEAKER_01]: in other wild grassy weed species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you walk through those fields in the
summer and half the field winds up in your
[SPEAKER_01]: socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's an excellent seed dispersal
mechanism and, of course, just the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't want in agriculture because we
want those seeds to hang on to their seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to remain on their heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of interesting about the BTR
genes, there's two of them, is that both
[SPEAKER_01]: of them are loss of functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's deletions and that leads to a loss
of function of the abscission layer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: VRS1, which is the two row six row,
is also a loss of function situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also due, in this case, to multiple
different deletions inside the same gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: NUDE, the hull adherence, is also a loss
of function.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the whole gene is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Takeda and all revealed that in all
the excessions that they looked at,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene has just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 kb of it plus some flanking sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have then generated some new mutants
and then kept up with other ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: generating the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth habits, again, not the topic of
today's seminar, but loss of function
[SPEAKER_01]: deletions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In flowering time, there are also loss of
function deletions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just this kind of long list of
these domestication traits being loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: function and that kind of gives us
something to think about if you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about some of the simplest applications of
genome editing, how many other things are
[SPEAKER_01]: there out there that you might want to go
into and then just generate loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: function mutants with and come up with
target phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a paper that just came out
recently here in Nature Genetics by Masher
[SPEAKER_01]: et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do a lot of nice genomics on some
paleo botanical remains of barley at
[SPEAKER_01]: Masada in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot to see about this
barley, including the fact that it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: very much like barley as we might see
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Influorescence might be just a tad
shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing about it, it was still
covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 4,000 years post-domestication,
in that end of the world, there was still
[SPEAKER_01]: covered barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Takeda et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: argue that there was probably a
monophyletic origin of the naked trait and
[SPEAKER_01]: that that domestication event happened
about 8,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not sure exactly where this
happened, but we've got a couple of hints
[SPEAKER_01]: as to where that may have been and we'll
come to that in just a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this domestication moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have this just explosive
dissemination of agriculture and animal
[SPEAKER_01]: husbandry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a whole bunch of different
types of cattle that are growing across
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's proceeding at a rate of maybe
about a mile per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that may seem kind of slow if you
can walk 20 miles in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think about actually then
planting, harvesting a crop, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: convincing your neighbor to plant and
harvest that crop, then mile progressions
[SPEAKER_01]: every year are actually pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quickly, barley moves out across the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this migration and specialization then
leads to things that come back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've kind of told this little
history here of barley and then I'm coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into this sort of migration thing to tell
you a little bit about Europe and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about Asia and then some alternate
uses of barley and hulls in those two
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Europe, you had an ever increasing
focus on barley for its use in the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say there weren't uses also for
human food and animal feeding and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, but principally for beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And principally, the forms that were used
were barley with hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those tended to be spring growth
habits and they tended to be two rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this little cartoon here,
you see a representation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhein-Heitskabutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the German purity law.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is barley here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they didn't know about yeast at
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of added later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the argument was, and not the
argument, the law was and is that the beer
[SPEAKER_01]: could only contain those three and four
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not contain adjuncts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an angry wheat, an angry maize,
and an angry rice up here who cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in the beer as they are wont
to do in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an angry wheat, an angry maize,
and an angry rice up here who cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in the beer as they are wont
to do in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they said, well, hey, make the beer
out of the coarser grain and then leave
[SPEAKER_01]: the wheat out there for nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're a Hefeweizen enthusiast or
something, you'll know that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: still a tradition of brewing with wheat in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other piece there was that
unscrupulous brewers were adding toxic and
[SPEAKER_01]: even hallucinogenic ingredients as
preservatives or flavorings in their
[SPEAKER_01]: beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a whole frontier that will
continuously be explored, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we see an increase in craft brewing and
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those two elements will probably be
coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may be promulgating a new
Rheinheitskabot here to prevent that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing from happening again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So meanwhile, a very different sort of
scenario has unfolded in Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and particularly in central and East Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, barley assumes a role in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so particularly, its role in food was
most notable in the Himalayan Plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this gentleman's a Tibetan Buddhist
monk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's preparing to eat some sampa,
which is, in this case, prepared from a
[SPEAKER_01]: toasted barley flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's mixed with yak butter and green
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a very nutritious material
that can be very easily prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at very high elevations,
not a tremendous amount of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: required to prepare this food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a recent paper in Science by Chen
et al actually argues that barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, allowed for the settlement of the
Himalayan Plateau, that you simply could
[SPEAKER_01]: not have moved into those higher
elevations had it not been for this very
[SPEAKER_01]: early maturing cereal and also,
in their case, a cereal that was naked so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it could be immediately consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may ask, well, why can't you just
eat barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, but the lemma and palea,
that whole, consists of cellulose,
[SPEAKER_01]: hemicellulose, and lignin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not palatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is insoluble dietary fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whereas a lot of us need fiber in our
diets, we generally don't need insoluble
[SPEAKER_01]: dietary fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just much easier to not have
it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody eat barley today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, you ought to be eating it
every day, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OK, anybody eat barley this week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's why we come out from the
west to the east and we proselytize our
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was it a pearl barley, perhaps,
that you had, if anybody eats it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is pearl barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pearl barley is barley that has been
mechanically abraded to remove the hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have a naked barley,
you don't have to pearl it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pearling is this grinding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that grinding process removes the
lemma and palea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also removes a little bit of testa,
a little bit of pericarb, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: alluron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's enough to make your barley no
longer be considered a whole grain,
[SPEAKER_01]: legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not you're losing
phytonutrients, that's a whole other topic
[SPEAKER_01]: of discussion here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But legally, you cannot call that a whole
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not that the Tibetans were worried
about whole grain or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they selected for naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And incidentally, populations where there
is high consumption of barley have the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest incidence of colorectal cancers of
any society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soluble dietary fiber is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a number of other positive
effects that I'll come to in just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a quick walk through of a
Japanese grocery store showing a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: sample of barley products that are readily
accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as you got into China and Japan and
Korea, barley was an important part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: culinary and nutrition culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, rice was preeminent there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so barley has kind of, to my
understanding, a subsidiary role and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes a very sort of a negative
perception role in those areas where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: viewed as the famine food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was what you ate only when you
didn't have rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's been kind of a psychological
barrier that people have been having to
[SPEAKER_01]: work for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of brings us to what's barley
used for and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Malt in the making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process of malting barley is a
process of controlled germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the result of the end of the
first phase and into the second phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've gone through what's called
the steep, where the barley is
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatively soaked and then exposed to
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's allowed to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the little rootlets that are
emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the incipient shoot is actually
forming under the hull, but you can't see
[SPEAKER_01]: it in this case because it is a barley
that has a hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that germination process is
accomplished, then the barley is kilned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the temperature and
duration of that kilning process,
[SPEAKER_01]: you come out with a range of malts,
which then go into our beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have everything from pale malts
all the way to roasted malts at the other
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might ask the question,
well, why barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we do this with anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it to anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are now malting companies that
are malting other grains besides barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notable is one in Colorado called grouse
malting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their maltstress, Twilla, is an expert
in malting things like chia and buckwheat
[SPEAKER_01]: and other grains than for celiacs who
would like to have malted grains going
[SPEAKER_01]: into a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why malted barley for beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So malted barley is like a perfect little
nutrition capsule for yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process of fermentation,
what we're after is ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're harnessing the yeast to give
us its excretia so that we can have
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wanted to design the perfect
little nutrient capsule for yeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be that malted barley
kernel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why of all the cereals that are
out there, barley provides the optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: balance of starch, sugars, proteins that
can carry on the fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And allow yeast to do for us what we want
it to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about barley foods?
[SPEAKER_01]: So barley foods today account for a
negligible portion of the total barley
[SPEAKER_01]: that's produced in the United States and
consumed, certainly less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the FDA says that if you
incorporate barley at a specified amount
[SPEAKER_01]: into your diet, you will reduce your risk
of heart disease, you'll reduce your risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of type 2 diabetes, and you will achieve
satiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Achieving satiety alone is something that
could be a goal for many of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to sort of be cool and happy with
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just eat your barley and that's where
it will take you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what accounts for these wonderful
properties?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a soluble dietary fiber fraction
called beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beta-glucan is found in cell walls
throughout the barley endosperm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-glucan is found in appreciable
quantities only in oatmeal, otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: in oats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in oatmeal, Mark Sorrels isn't here so
I can really knock oats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in oats, it's only found in the outer
layer of the endosperm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why oats make that horrible,
gluey, icky thing when you cook them,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the beta-glucan is just sort of
right out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cook barley flakes and you'll have
actual integrity of each flake,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you'll still have the same level of
beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as the FDA comes out with this
RDA and there was research prior to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, of course, what do we do as plant
breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if a little bit is good,
a lot would be better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden, every breeding program
is out there going, well, let's breed for
[SPEAKER_01]: high beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've been, in fact, very
successful in doing so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your average barley, a malting barley,
will contain about 4% to 5% grain
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That beta-glucan in the malting barley is
broken down by beta-glucanase,
[SPEAKER_01]: endogenous beta-glucanases, during the
malting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, in fact, brewers want low levels of
beta-glucan in their beer, otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes viscous and causes processing
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the food, on the other hand,
you say, wow, beta-glucan, I want this in
[SPEAKER_01]: my food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so breeders have been very successful,
even over the last 10 years, in developing
[SPEAKER_01]: high beta-glucan barleys, and they now
have them up to, say, 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to eat one bowl of barley
flakes made from a barley that's 4%
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucan, that will satisfy your RDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are barley breads made with 40%
barley flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley has gluten in the sense that it
will elicit a negative response in a
[SPEAKER_01]: celiac, but it does not have gluten for a
baker in the sense that its dough does not
[SPEAKER_01]: have strength and elasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your maximum blend is going to be about
40% barley going into a wheat blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have two slices of bread made
with a barley that's about 4% to 5%
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucan, you will meet your RDA,
a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens if you eat 15%
beta-glucan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gastrointestinal distress of epic room
clearing proportions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant breeders, be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start going down this road of
selecting for more, there are sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: unanticipated platropic effects,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that has led to is kind of a
schism in barley breeding, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you have a whole grain model,
you just can get by with 4% to 5%
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that high stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, however, you're on a model where you
want to extract or fractionate the
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucan and put that onto a Twinkie or
a Cheeto and call it health food,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you want to go for the high stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of two different markets
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of the barley used in the world today
is used to feed animals, mostly ruminant
[SPEAKER_01]: animals, but I didn't have a nice picture
of cows, so I had a picture of these pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these pigs, in fact, are in a barley
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see in the distance there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a barley field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this farmer just, unleashes them into
barley fields and then moves the electric
[SPEAKER_01]: fence a couple of hundred feet every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pigs are happier than if they were
in clover, if you know the expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pig in clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just eating this green barley as
they go along, and that's the residue of
[SPEAKER_01]: the barley straw below.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the barley in the world today
is fed to animals, and about 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the US, until about maybe 20 years
ago, and we'll see the graph of this and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about it, we'll talk about that in a
sec, that was also the case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've had a complete flip,
so that almost all the barley grown in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States is used for malting and
brewing, a little bit for food,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a very little bit for feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the feed markets are essential,
in my opinion, because if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: feed market, you have no safety net for
your grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley has excellent feeding properties
and a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It confirms that and sort of brings us to
this point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about that research in a
moment once we've talked about how we got
[SPEAKER_01]: to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: US barley acreage, millions of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you follow this graph back to 1986,
which is when I started my job,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's even more obviously linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a cause and effect relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer Pat breeds barley in Oregon,
the more the barley acres in America go
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long since established.
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless the tenure system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a number of reasons why this
has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we go into sort of this slope
of despondency here, let's talk about this
[SPEAKER_01]: little plateau of encouragement over here
and what that's due to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that little plateau of encouragement is
due to places like New York State,
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst others, where barley acreage is
actually increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is it increasing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's increasing because of the craft
brewing, craft distilling, and craft
[SPEAKER_01]: malting industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition, here you've
legislated and that has further driven
[SPEAKER_01]: barley acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the craft industry is what is
driving this slight increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really going to be a tapering
phenomenon, because there's only so much
[SPEAKER_01]: barley that those industries can absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you're running a craft
malting enterprise, 10 ton batch is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty respectable batch size.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To run a 10 ton batch system requires
about 500 acres of barley, high yielding
[SPEAKER_01]: barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't take a whole lot to meet
those needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have the Sanoco facility
opening up here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to have, I think,
six 10 tonners chomping on barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to lead to an increase
in acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of overall impact,
it's still a couple of thousand acres will
[SPEAKER_01]: probably feed that machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what caused that decline?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a number of factors that
contributed to that decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are all feeding into this sort of
story where we're headed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody in here ever played pit?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your favorite commodity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be the Chicago board of
trade game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're pretending that you're down
in the pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're calling out commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got pork belly, pork belly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got barley, barley,
barley, barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley is one of the cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But barley is no longer traded on the
Chicago board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that sort of shows where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at where barley is going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest importer of barley,
if you had any, would be Saudi Arabia,
[SPEAKER_01]: followed by China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So China is a definite beer market there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia and Canada dominate that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saudi Arabia is primarily a traditional
livestock use area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of racing camels are fed on
barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a particularly stable market,
the racing camel, in an era of declining
[SPEAKER_01]: revenues in some of these countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are we seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a situation where barley is
actually priced after corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a function of corn prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so typically, barley is priced at 80%
of the price of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn prices now are incredibly depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we follow commodities markets,
their feed prices are incredibly low at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If barley is 80% of something incredibly
low, which is true, in conventional feed
[SPEAKER_01]: barley production, you lose money from the
get-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a reason people don't want to
have feed barley out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are feed barley prices so low when the
research confirms that probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding value of barley can be the same or
superior to corn in some feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things have happened which are
so much bigger than anything that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: address as plant breeders or scientists
that we just have to mention them and move
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them are federal farm programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a system of very indirect price
supports in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is called revenue
assurance, where you can essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure your crop, if you have the right
crop, to a value that you know will allow
[SPEAKER_01]: you to generate a stable income.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that for barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, you have a situation where
you've had changes in the confined animal
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have enormous operations for
consolidated dairies and feed lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in Oregon, these folks find it
cheaper to bring in Midwestern corn in
[SPEAKER_01]: unit trains than to buy barley from the
farm next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leads to a situation where you
then have no market for feed, even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: did have a place to actually be selling
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have sort of the final
clincher in this, which is you have
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly successful plant breeders in
the Midwest breeding corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And corn and soybeans, along with global
warming, have moved increasingly northward
[SPEAKER_01]: and westward and occupied what were barley
acres in Minnesota and North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: That corn and soybeans happens to be GMO,
which is neither here nor there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, in terms of that effect on
barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does play into the story that we're
going to come to in a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in our neck of the woods, we don't
have a whole lot of GMO corn or soybeans
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have herbicide-resistant wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have imidazolin-resistant wheat
generated as a mutation, not as a GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the consequence of that is that
herbicide is applied to ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: where formerly barley was a rotation crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That herbicide persists for 12 months,
and the barley can't follow in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between all of those factors,
then, we've seen barley acres plummet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since I've worked on barley for 30
years, I don't want to see it disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see it just become a relic
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that in addition to just
wanting things to persist, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: cool, that there are reasons that barley
can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: For farmers, it's early maturing,
two weeks earlier than wheat, uses about
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% less nitrogen than wheat, but has all
the same standard grain input.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Processors, it's absolutely essential for
malting.
[SPEAKER_01]: For food processors, the same
infrastructure you use for milling,
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding, cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the feed industry, rations and
delivery can be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers, gives you a range of beverages,
heart-healthy foods, and some new sensory
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes in your diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of good reasons
to have barley out there in our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard to convince people sometimes
that that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've got now is to shift gears
a little bit, and I've kind of told you
[SPEAKER_01]: this barley story, and use you as a bit of
a focus group, because we're having a
[SPEAKER_01]: planning grant session at the end of this
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funded by the NIFA OREI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the Organic Research branch of
NIFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a planning grant is where you kind of
get people together to say, do we really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to write a full grant proposal on
this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the proposal is about the release,
testing, and development of public sector
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-use naked barley varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I come back to this topic
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, winter barley growing next to a GMO
corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a per unit efficiency basis,
this thing is going to produce a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more than this one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this particular case, this is not a
comparison, because that is a GMO corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: which this particular panel will not
allow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is then, OK, we come into
the organic panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could we do that would capitalize on
the kinds of research that they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in funding, and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is that we're looking
at market simplification here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a naked barley,
in theory, it could be used for all three
[SPEAKER_01]: uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could malt with it, you could eat it,
and you could use it as feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a farmer currently, if they raise malt
barley, has barley with a hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they sell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they sell it as food if they have
excess protein?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you'd have to grind the hull off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they sell it for feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're going to be at a loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a naked barley,
can you get a maltster or brewer to use
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is no, because they're not
familiar with malting and brewing with
[SPEAKER_01]: naked barleys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get a feeder to use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to go uncover
someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the conventional large scale
commodity markets, there is not room to
[SPEAKER_01]: pursue this multi-use naked idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence the idea of saying, OK, the organic
sector may be receptive to a newer idea,
[SPEAKER_01]: and thus, that could be a platform where
we could seek to get some acceptance,
[SPEAKER_01]: some adoption, and then let it diffuse out
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So attributes will be that it has to be
naked, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to have modest grain beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have 15 percenters because the
brewers won't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to have normal starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's waxy and high and low starch
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to avoid those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to have yield and
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to want to have some
interesting sensory attributes that make
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to eat this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of follow a maxim that's been
around there for a long time, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: that a good malt barley is a good feed and
a good feed barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't believe that, these are ice
cream sandwiches made out of barley
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies with a barley malt ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensory attributes, fiber, flavor,
calorie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we saying here that in this
situation, we are looking for the
[SPEAKER_01]: elimination of the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 10,000 years, it's time to just go
naked and then say, OK, let's focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular aspect of barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why go organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody in here done on-farm organic
research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic breeding scale plots can be some
challenges, particularly weed control,
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly in our environment,
our university farm has a very limited
[SPEAKER_01]: certified organic acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't put in really representative
rotations to properly encourage fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: and weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a consequence, you get into this
kind of weird input replacement and
[SPEAKER_01]: endless weed patrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was an organic increased block of
a new naked barley of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, buck naked barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some additional work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went the organic route, again,
because the idea was, hey, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be perhaps receptiveness to this
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also struck out with the conventional
panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some really elegant genomic
selection models for human food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we created a resource I'll mention in
a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I told the graduate students
earlier today, never remain bitter about
[SPEAKER_01]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just memorize them and repeat them,
because someday that person's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll understand the mortal
wound that they inflicted on a fellow
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a review from one of these
genomic selection proposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this individual says, hey,
I can hardly imagine barley as being the
[SPEAKER_01]: poster child for good nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, get some fiber, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do to make this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first and fundamental thing,
you may go, well, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley has had a hole on it for 10,000
years because of the brewing tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hole is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is barley malting with a hole on
it because of a process called lottering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lottering is after you have taken your
malt and you have boiled it and added your
[SPEAKER_01]: bittering hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that liquid called the wort is then
passed through the grain bed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process known as sparging and moved off to
the fermenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That grain, that spent malt at the bottom
of that tank, then is a natural filtration
[SPEAKER_01]: system par excellence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why holes have persisted until
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you ask the question, how can we get
past that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is with a technology called mash
filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Membranes and pressure use a whole lot
less water and a whole lot less energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many breweries in Europe are already
mash filter breweries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went that way simply to reduce energy
and water usage in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaskan Amber, you may be familiar with,
is a mash filter-equipped brewery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got three or so craft breweries
in the US, including one that just built a
[SPEAKER_01]: new brewery in Bend, Oregon, Crux
Fermentation Project that is all mash
[SPEAKER_01]: filter-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have ways now that you can move a
naked barley malt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is naked barley malting down here
directly into a mash filtration system.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that are barley people,
one of the key parameters that we work on
[SPEAKER_01]: for malting is something called malt
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malt extract numbers of a good barley with
a hole are typically around 82,
[SPEAKER_01]: 83 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a naked barley, that malt extract can
be at 88 or 89 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means more beer per unit of malt put
into the brewery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the brewer is going to be very
attracted by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is a hole bringing to beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: A stringency, microorganisms, things that
you may not particularly want in some
[SPEAKER_01]: styles of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we have some advantages
there for the brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about for foods?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was at a recent event in Portland
called the Plant Variety Showcase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing called the Coler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a culinary breeding network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a local baker who's
prepared a series of breads from different
[SPEAKER_01]: barley varieties because the point of this
was to showcase foods made from a range of
[SPEAKER_01]: barley varieties and pepper varieties and
squash varieties and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make delicious breads of all sorts
and styles with different types of barley
[SPEAKER_01]: up to about that 40 percent inclusion
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be exactly the same barley
that went to your malt house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could go into those loaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And better yet, the malt that you made out
of that naked barley can also feed back
[SPEAKER_01]: into your baking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings in a whole other palette
of flavors, aromas, and sensories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the organic feed sector,
at least by the advertisements we see,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all have a much better time at their
lives than some people in some other sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so optimistically, yes, we can see
whole grain barley is moving into various
[SPEAKER_01]: animal feeding regimes because that safety
net is absolutely essential as the third
[SPEAKER_01]: leg on a stool, if you will, for marketing
a barley crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we come to the plant breeding part
of this finally here in the last seven
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes or whatever that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after 30 years of writing grant
proposals to brewing companies and NSF
[SPEAKER_01]: panels and other people about different
aspects of our crop, finally, this is like
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time I get to write one that's
just sort of carte blanche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go like all the way back to those
just like sort of fundamental things about
[SPEAKER_01]: what you do with the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is, you know, what are
your target environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are your target users out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the target traits you're going to
work on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of germplasm are you going to
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to advance that
germplasm?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the basis of your selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of varieties are you going
to release?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to kind of walk you through
these real quickly and then open it up for
[SPEAKER_01]: some opportunities for discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perspective here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the target environments that we have
are the Pacific Northwest, the Upper
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest, and the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be New York here with Mark
Sorrells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our colleague Kevin Smith in
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why these regions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have plant breeders who are
interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have processors who are perhaps early
adopters of some technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have consumers who are interested in a
variety of foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the anticipation is that we would
see a subsequent diffusion out into other
[SPEAKER_01]: geographic areas and into the conventional
sector as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our target audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one that we cannot neglect,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very good friend of the
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had one of our food barley
composites growing in her garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she invites her friends over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have this sort of little harvest
party.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people had never grown a cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had never processed a cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had never prepared a cereal that was
two hours old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we harvested this barley,
took over our threshing machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested that, prepared it, and had a
barley tabbouleh made from something
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd harvested hours before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit 10 people out there who went and
told 10 other people about how barley was
[SPEAKER_01]: something you could grow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's an important piece there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of equal and greater importance are
their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so moving barley into schools through
various science and education pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we call those sort of the learners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to have very small
acreage things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have artisans, and these are the folks
down at your farmers markets who they have
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tens of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft, maybe the hundreds of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the industrial sort of regional
folks, maybe 1,000 acres levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's different audiences we're
going to be targeting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need different kinds of
germplasm for those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be different sorts of
traits that we target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has to be homozygous recessive
nude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we just have to have naked barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moulting and brewing quality is something
that already exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the American Malt Barley
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some allowance for higher malt
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to complain about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe just a little bit higher
beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a 200 instead of under 100 where
they are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking scary levels of
beta-glucan in beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food quality is really very simple,
as long as you don't bring in novel starch
[SPEAKER_01]: types or high beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our life as barley breeders could almost
be as simple as that of corn breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just breed for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want more of this good naked
stuff growing per unit acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, you've got all the
additional challenges of what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make yield under an organic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's yield that you're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feed quality, I think it's yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, once you get greater market
penetration, then you'll start to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, some feedback into the breeding
programs that says, we need that flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: attribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this kind of kernel hardness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have those signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, growth habit, I'd like to see
facultative and spring barley because of
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But winters are OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two rows are preferred, but six rows are
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colors, the whole palette is OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're breeding for conventional
markets right now, you'll recognize that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not the way that you can breed for
large commodity producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you what color, what specific
level, 101 traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're much more confined and
defined in your breeding scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: The germplasm bases, we've got some
ongoing naked barley programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have something called the naked
barley doubled haploid composite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a germplasm release on this that
we're writing up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the seed is available if anybody would
like to get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 900 double haploids derived from
about 35 crosses amongst 28 parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 different grandparents that we sourced
from 14 different breeding programs and
[SPEAKER_01]: selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created this resource in anticipation
of doing this genomic selection program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grant didn't get funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, the hell with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drove the combine perpendicular to all the
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took us an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just mixed everything together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've sent this material around to
home gardeners, schools, public breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs, private breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Sorrels, your colleague here,
has started a naked barley program based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the naked barley double haploid
composite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got springs, winters, facultatives,
two rows, six rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whites, blacks, browns, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole range of material in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some very interesting things to do with
schools in terms of natural selection
[SPEAKER_01]: versus implemented selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germplasm in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all the double haploids that are
in this composite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the original and remnant seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all 900 of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: My breeding program is 100% double haploid
based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're producing new double haploids
from cycles with naked malt barleys that
[SPEAKER_01]: have come out of a Canadian program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll pursue a collaborative
development and testing of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But segregating generations will be
available to those who would want them at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basis of selection for that composite,
you can simply go real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Allard published this beautiful paper
in the late 70s about evolutionary plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed that just by planting the
same mixture year after year for his 30
[SPEAKER_01]: years at UC Davis, he had the same rate of
gain as his colleague Charlie Schaller who
[SPEAKER_01]: was running a pedigree breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Charlie was a pretty good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So natural selection bulk breeding is not
to be denied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's directed phenotypic selection,
genotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say this is probably a focus of
genomic selection internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are thoughts that we might
implement something to some extent in a
[SPEAKER_01]: program like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's the plant breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Professional or participatory?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a participatory program we have
going on with two folks in Eastern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Seth and his dad, Brad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working with us to develop a
variety, in their case, of double haploid
[SPEAKER_01]: barley that will specifically feed into
their estate malting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, let's come to germplasm
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sorts of varieties will we be
releasing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'll lay it all out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an open source person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get really concerned about tight control
over germplasm resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I support at least the concept of
the open seed source initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the variety full pint,
which then we released underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: auspices of that organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using germplasm releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a particularly stuffy tech
transfer office at my university.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could quote me as saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've called them worse sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they won't let you release
something as a variety, you can release it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a germplasm through the Journal of
Plant Registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gets the material out into the public
domain and people can access it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem being that you can't sell
classes of certified seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we've made some headway and,
except here, varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the weirdest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole trip has been weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get here yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had this time frame thing in my
travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the spell check quit working in
my PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't found a way to renew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, we've got public varieties
with no PVP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives you an option there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The revenue thing is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our office will argue as many
that, hey, we need to mine our breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to become self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to have public sector
breeding, it needs to pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we use the current seed royalties we'd
have, 1,000 acres is something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: optimistically, we would have in one of
those target growing regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would generate you about $2,000 a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The university would take a third of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took your 1,000 acres and convinced
your growers that they self-assessed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of grain produced, then you'd
start seeing some serious money or even
[SPEAKER_01]: some percentage thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that if you want to see this
kind of breeding generate a revenue,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to look for some
other funding model other than what we
[SPEAKER_01]: currently have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all that, Barley World is where we
try to keep in touch with the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please have a look at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to the many people who have worked
on the Barley crew, past and present,
[SPEAKER_01]: and brought to you by these various
funding agencies who have all given us
[SPEAKER_01]: funding over the years without restriction
in all of our germplasm and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is not in T3, it's only because we
just haven't gotten around to posting it
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: The naked Barley, is career opportunity
for disease susceptibility in those heads?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it would be the first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, are we going to get
disease issues by going to naked Barley so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're more likely to get homes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not a piece of our impediment in
that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is not something that is not
immediately realizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not seen disease issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have to take extra care in
threshing and processing that grain so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't damage the embryo because
that can reduce your germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could ask the question,
why was the Masada Barley covered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Surely they could identify naked variants
by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were probably making some beer,
but they were probably also eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there may have been some advantages
to those worship variants for different
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a mesh filter set up that
cannot be used with covered Barley?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it basically, you know, traditional
set up works with covered and mesh filters
[SPEAKER_02]: set up works with naked Barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So question was, mesh filtration,
they are being used widely today,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, all with covered Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it does is instead of making a
kind of coarse grist out of your mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can essentially intermold that down to
a fine powder, at which point then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: also getting more out of that mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then instead of having that fine
powder, having 10% penicillulose,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't giving you anything,
it would be 100% starch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Barley has three layers, seven layers
in the embryo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that actually, does that translate into
why Barley is historically endangered?
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's three, sometimes it's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it doesn't get harder in the
embryo's production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a question related to,
could the structure, the outer structure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Barley seed, even the alluron
layers, have an effect on, be responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for the fact that it is the favorite sort
of product?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hazard that that's a good
hypothesis at the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not just the sheer level of
enzyme, I'm sure that you can find an
[SPEAKER_01]: organism that would have a higher,
a glutenase, or a higher amylase,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a higher alpha amylase perhaps,
but it's the balance of those across,
[SPEAKER_01]: plus the fact that you've got a lot of
cellular carbohydrate that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts for more of these advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do know that gene expression in the
alluron, with signals from the embryo
[SPEAKER_01]: during germination, accounts for a lot of
the enzyme activity within the first one
[SPEAKER_01]: we're capturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't answer your question if it's
probably as great on the layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any effort to select Barley with
humidazolinal resistance, like wheat and
[SPEAKER_05]: sunflowers and other possible incentives
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve Ulrich, who is the breeder in
Washington State, now retired,
[SPEAKER_01]: started a mutation breeding program to
target the same gene that then was mutated
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to give humidazolinal resistance
to wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: His successor, Kevin Murphy, is carrying
that work on, and they are in the process
[SPEAKER_01]: of releasing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is that a plus or a minus
in the system is a horrible kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: geography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, that's a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in Australia, they now have to
release commercial humidazolinal
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Northwest application, they would
be so they could be put back in a repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: location without the use of reservicides,
particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really needed in that
configuration.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Australia, they needed an additional
herbicide in order to deal with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: their wheat problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I guess that class of
herbicides is one to which wheat is
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly involved in resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a particularly sustainable
long-term alternative to wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, how do we convince a
current grower of Barley to go to a public
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing we have to do is assure them
of a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, in fact, the first phase of this
proposed project that we're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: together would be to produce large,
semi-commercial amounts of grain so that
[SPEAKER_01]: those artisan and industrial users can
access enough meat and barley to make
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial balts, commercial beers,
commercial foods, and get those barley to
[SPEAKER_01]: the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really, unfortunately,
I don't think it's just a plant-breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the varieties exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a marketing and production
issue to get that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield-wise, there is not a penalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top-yielder at our breeding
program, and we think we've done a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good job, the last two years has been a
naked barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was feeding the best of our
barley as withholds, and the halt counts
[SPEAKER_01]: for about 10% of the total mass of grain
yield at the public market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you make a naked barley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take an elite barley, and then how
do you make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you turn it into a naked barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so naked barley, how do you get a
naked barley?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your simplest thing is going to be to
back-cross it in with how you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: accelerate that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genes on the lawn are the chromosome
7-8, so it's not in some
[SPEAKER_01]: super-hydrochromatic region.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, and I know of, other genes
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a pretty quick conversion program can
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some of those kinds of
projects, and that's how we got the naked
[SPEAKER_01]: gene into our germ class, is through a
marker system back-crossing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR, probably not going to be permitted
by an organic panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know exactly where that sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, it's not just this kind of
real simple plug-and-play system we
[SPEAKER_01]: released with barley, but this gene ought
to be a pretty decent candidate,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can couple and find how
induced mutants have been identified that
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically lead to a loss of function
with a single sniff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to be able to manipulate that
gene fairly readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a collaborative experiment
ongoing, just to see if we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Related to this question, so when you make
a naked barley, you already went through a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck with a genetic bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do this back-crossing,
does it even reduce your genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: further?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this naked double-heploid composite
that I mentioned that had 40 parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 or so of those were naked barleys
sourced from different breeding programs
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least with fingers crossed,
then we have diversity at other positions
[SPEAKER_01]: in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But according to Kira and all,
we are kind of monophyletic, and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a single origin of that original
mutation that led to the deletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be things right in the
vicinity that are going to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: important to us, and so that's where a
couple of quick scans around 7-HL and
[SPEAKER_01]: other germ plies up to see what important
genes were hiding around when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: born.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web, at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
