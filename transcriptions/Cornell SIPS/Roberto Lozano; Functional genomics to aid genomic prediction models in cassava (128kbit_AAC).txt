[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I'm gonna I'm really excited to
talk to you about a lot of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been doing the last four years
and a half here and everything will go
[SPEAKER_00]: around this idea of of using functional
genomics to help genomic prediction and
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection models in Casaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and back in 2013 I was about to get
interviewed by Jean-Luc through Skype and
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what genomic selection was
so I started looking at the literature and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm pretty sure happened with most of
you trying to approach the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection were haunted by this scheme that
I don't even need to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This however at the time didn't help me to
understand how these models were working
[SPEAKER_00]: so I came with a scheme out of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly you have phenotypes and phenotypes
of a training population and combining
[SPEAKER_00]: these two elements you will build a
prediction model that here I'm depicting
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a wormhole because I didn't have any
idea what was happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did know was that the DNA of an
unphenotype Casaba was traveling through
[SPEAKER_00]: space and time to give us genomic expected
breeding values.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically your expectation or your
prediction on how that unphenotype Casaba
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna perform in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so what I did understand at the
moment was that my mission within the
[SPEAKER_00]: project was to use functional genomics as
a proxy to understand the biology behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypes that we're trying to
predict and see where and you know try to
[SPEAKER_00]: test whether the inclusion of this extra
element in the prediction model will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so today I have three topics for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through all of them but just an
important thing is that all of them will
[SPEAKER_00]: go around this idea of using biology and
genomic prediction models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again but back on 2013 I you know I was
new on Casaba and I went to the data base
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to find genomic information and
Casaba was a really orphan crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't a lot of genomic resources
or genomic research at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really interested in working with
biotic stresses so I went to the database
[SPEAKER_00]: checking for resistant genes in Casaba and
I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Martha at the time we saw it as an
opportunity to both get this data mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute a little bit to the growing
genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic libraries of Casaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified this family of gene the
NBSLR family that is known to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest resistant gene family in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some phylogenetics and most
importantly we mapped them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: position of the 18 chromosomes of Casaba
and this data later helped other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists to make sense out of their GWAS
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example this is a publication by
Ismael Cayondo a collaborator in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found a couple of QTLs for Casaba brown
streak disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them being in chromosome 11 and you
will have to believe me here but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom in here on the on the peak it
collocates nicely with a small cluster of
[SPEAKER_00]: NBSLR genes and some collaborators from
Kenya now are evaluating using knockouts
[SPEAKER_00]: with CRISPR and complementation assays to
you know validate these candidate genes as
[SPEAKER_00]: the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah that's pretty nice and again that
was published in 2015 but in the years
[SPEAKER_00]: past and Casaba stopped being an orphaned
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly in the span of two or three years
there were lots of research going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice haplotype mine thanks to
Ramu and the Butler lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of transcriptomics studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A better genome with a really nice RNAC
guided annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have even methylation data and a
plethora of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from now on we switch a little bit from
doing the genomic resources generator to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more like data scavengers and try to
use all these to put them in the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay let's make a stop here and I'm going
to talk a little bit about which models
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be using in the rest of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoiler alert we won't be using any fancy
Bayesian or machine learning algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we will be using is just different
modifications of the good old DBLAB model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay for those that don't know what DBLAB
model is it's basically a mixed model feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on the basis of individuals rather than
markers but using a covariance matrix that
[SPEAKER_00]: is calculated as the genomic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and this incorporates these genetic
random effects where you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the ERM using all the markers
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014 however this group from Albus
Price and Gusev and company were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in studying how splitting or
partitioning the genomic regions into
[SPEAKER_00]: functional elements let's say coding
regions, UTR regions, promoter regions
[SPEAKER_00]: would influence this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know DBLAB models and any model
that will, well most of the models that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work with with engineering
predictions where we have lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors and a few individuals have to
find a way how to deal with collinearity
[SPEAKER_00]: and overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DBLAB used shrinkage where all most of
the SNP effects were random and are shrunk
[SPEAKER_00]: towards zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shrinkage severity will be a
function of the numbers of SNPs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of these guys was what if we
partition the genome in different random
[SPEAKER_00]: effects genetic random effects and I from
now on I'm just gonna call these guys as
[SPEAKER_00]: kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one of these kernels is enriched
for causal variance due to biological
[SPEAKER_00]: priors I have this might result in an
increase in prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you are relaxing the shrinkage
severity you are allowing more markers
[SPEAKER_00]: into that partition having a bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically the rationale that
I'm gonna use on the models that I
[SPEAKER_00]: explained throughout my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second nice thing well useful thing
about this research was that a Gusev and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators determined that we need to
have level sequence imputation when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are using genomic partitioning
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the estimation of a percentage
of any heritabilities will be really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just use genotype SNP for example
GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison when you use genotype full
genome imputation mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so yeah this is a little of the
background that will be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the second topic that I want to tell
you about is the actually a case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: How my first approach to use biology to
improve genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you I was really interested in
working with biotic diseases, biotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cassava Brown streak disease was really
attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study I tried to use whole
genome imputation and a transcriptomic
[SPEAKER_00]: study that I will later show you to
increase the performance of this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just briefly Cassava Brown streak disease
caused by Cassava Brown streak virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really awful disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms in leaf you have chlorosis around
the secondary veins but the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is that you have root rot on the
cassava tubers that make them inedible
[SPEAKER_00]: even for animal feed and they are
transmitted by white flies in a
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-persistent way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so that's our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to my previous scheme and
I'll show you how I'm going to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: the different elements into this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example the phenotypes evaluated
now will be CBSD related traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: measure of leaves and roots, three months,
six months, and one year after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotypes will be GBS markers that
will be imputed to whole genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wormhole or prediction model will be a
multi-kernel g-block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genomics data will be
transcriptomic studies, QTL information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and immunity related traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so now let's explain a little bit of
each of these components in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes we use were basically on
leaves and roots a categorical scale that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes from one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our high throughput phenotyping scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfred is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are all the phenotypes okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotypes we recognize with this Gusev
paper the necessity of going from 40,000
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that we were obtaining with GBS to
millions of markers through whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: imputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how was this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we are inventing markers
that weren't type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use this scheme of whole genome
imputation that uses the have map that was
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the Buckler lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: 241 individuals including cultivated
cassava, wild hybrids, and wild cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were deep sequence to 30x.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a nice haplotype maps of those
240 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we are performing here is that
when we have GBS we have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have a lot of interrogation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of size that we are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the whole genome imputation
algorithm does is try to infer which of
[SPEAKER_00]: these regions belongs to which of these
haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get most importantly the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it has the most probable haplotype of
each region it will just impute the
[SPEAKER_00]: missing genotypes with the ones present in
the haplotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you go from GBS 42,000
markers to millions of markers using this
[SPEAKER_00]: have map information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you will tell me yeah Roberto you
don't need millions of markers to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was that in my approach I was
interested in tagging different regions in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome that might be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I use only the 42k markers
from GBS I could only tag around 30% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I did Bigel imputation,
Bigel is just an algorithm of whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: imputation, I get to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally I stop with impute two,
that is for me at least a better whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome imputator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could get markers that will be
tagging close to 92%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only reason why I keep this
methodology together with those
[SPEAKER_00]: information from the Luceff paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah now we have phenotypes,
we have genotypes, we need a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph of the 18 chromosomes and
I'm plotting the LDS score, the mean LDS
[SPEAKER_00]: score.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what the mean LDS score is
just you graph each marker and then
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the R square of that marker with
all the markers in a bin of one megabase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you divide that by the number of
markers in that bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you plot all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you a sense of local LD
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the Casaba has like a
funky pattern of high LD close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: telomeres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second here I'm plotting, this is a
classical LD decay plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I'm doing differently
here is that I'm coloring chromosome one
[SPEAKER_00]: and chromosome four in a yellow and red
respectively because they have a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: introgression that doesn't have a lot of
recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what is dragging these files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funky LD pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: High R squares even when the markers are
positioned really far away in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so we have markers, we have
phenotypes, we have a population and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is our biological data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay this transcriptomics study was
performed by Teddy and Muge and published
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she basically grabbed two contrasting
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namikonga resistance to CBSD and Albert's
really susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she grafted these varieties with
infected scions and non-infected scions
[SPEAKER_00]: and evaluated differentially gene
expressed across seven different time
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six hours after grafting, 24 hours after
grafting, 48 hours and so on until 54 days
[SPEAKER_00]: after grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we observe here is that the
resistant plant in yellow has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: differential expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really aware that it's being
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the Albert's plant is susceptible
has like a really mild response at six
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and then nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: None different between the transcriptional
pattern between the control and the
[SPEAKER_00]: infected ones in all these time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just start reacting when it's basically
too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we start thinking how can we use
this transcriptomic data to weigh the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic prediction models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had several hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hypothesis was just brute force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah let's just use all the
differentially expressed genes and compare
[SPEAKER_00]: the accuracy that we have to the whole
genome imputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the full model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will always be comparing the accuracies
with the full model at the last column.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is CBSD measure on leaves six months
after planting and this is measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the model that we are running here is
a two kernel model.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the kernel will harbor all the SNPs
that are tagging differential express
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and the other kernel will have the
rest of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as any brute force approach usually
happens it didn't have a good result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prediction accuracies were basically
similar as the ones when we just used the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome imputation full data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with YANLU we tried to be a little
bit smarter about it and we had this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe those genes that have a
positive interaction between genotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inoculation status being if the plant was
controlled or inoculated could have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better effect, a major effect on the
resistant phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fit this model where expression,
the gene expression of each genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be explained by reps plus the
three-way interaction of genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation status and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we extracted those genes right here
that had a significant interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: G by I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and similar to the last picture we
calculated genomic accuracy, the
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction accuracies for this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red we have the three kernel model that
was fit with these G by I genes
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioned into chromosome 11,
chromosome 4, and the rest of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we also incorporated the fact that we
know that in chromosome 11 and 4 there
[SPEAKER_00]: were big big details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and we also fit a model with random
genes in the same proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that our model is doing
better than random for severity in leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and roots, but we are still not doing
better than when just using the basic G
[SPEAKER_00]: lab model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah that was the second hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't quite well work yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have a third hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if instead of using the
differentially expressed genes we just use
[SPEAKER_00]: a clustering method called weighted gene
co-expression network analysis to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: mine important genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's focus in this part of the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are a little off but it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a better idea of what weighted
gene co-expression network analysis is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is just clustering genes that have a
similar expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to the black module here,
and you'll have to believe me because the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors are off, this black module has
genes that are expressed only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Namikonga genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have another cyan module that
are mostly expressed in Albert.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be way redder.
[SPEAKER_00]: More red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are a little off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we get a bunch of modules with
this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again we try our technique of two
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the genes that are within our
module and everything else in the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: and compare them with the last column that
will be the whole genome imputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that was doing better than
the whole model was this module reds and
[SPEAKER_00]: only for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no really good results at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come up with a fourth hypothesis
that was basically desperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mix different sources of
information trying to beat the performance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole genome imputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with, you know, ranging from 1.7 to
2.5 percent overall prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't a big game but it was a
little game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have several options why this
approach didn't work as we were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the thing of the trait genetic
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: These CBSD resistant in these populations
have big QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe trying to mine information out
of the RNA-seq data is not really viable
[SPEAKER_00]: because of those two big QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our imputation accuracy was performed on a
HapMap that only had 240 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is issues with the phenotyping
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transcriptomic experiment was only
performed on two varieties that might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be representative of the population that
we are working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally the transcriptomic experiment
was infected using only one strain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, not with the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what usually happens in fielding
reality is that there is a co-infection of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ugandan cassava brown streak virus and
cassava brown streak virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the things that was also
disturbing me until that point was that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were only looking for important genes or
important regions within the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genetic region is only a tiny part
of the whole genome, of the whole cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are functional elements happening
outside of the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the motivation for doing this
third part of my thesis work was this
[SPEAKER_00]: article that I read on 2014 by Manoles
Kelly from the ENCODE project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of troubles because
the guys from the ENCODE said that 80% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the human genome is transcribed,
so 80% of the human genome is functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were lots of the
evolutionary values saying, you cannot say
[SPEAKER_00]: that because you are not under the light
of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guys from ENCODE found
evidence for 80% of the human genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: was transcribed, but we also have to
consider other evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have genetic evidence that is basically
that that generates phenotype and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: what you find when you run a GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have also evolutionary evidence,
meaning that regions in the genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: are constrained by evolution are more
probable functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in the light side of this,
I was also interested in trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: functional elements outside of the cassava
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings up to this, expanding the
cassava functional genome using PROSIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in 2015, John Lees from Cornell
Biotech published this article that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of excited me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was doing this nascent RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing you need to know
about these nascent techniques is that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to sequence the RNAs that are
inside the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sequence the same RNAs before
being spliced, but you can also sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: all those unstable RNAs that are later
degraded in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, John and collaborators
found that in promoters, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine that this is your promoter,
your gene is in this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you will have a transcript
going on the side of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he found was that there was an
unstable RNA also being transcribed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, he discovered that in
enhancer regions outside of the genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surrounding the enhancer will be
transcription of small RNAs in both
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those RNAs were called enhancer RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, Charles Danko, in
collaboration also with Adam Siepel and
[SPEAKER_00]: John Lees, published this DREC method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a machine learning, a support
vector regression machine that will allow
[SPEAKER_00]: you to, based on that nascent RNA
sequencing, identify transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory elements, including promoters
and enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I believe, hey,
maybe we can apply this idea to Casaba and
[SPEAKER_00]: identify enhancers that might be important
to explain phenotypes outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked with John.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were starting to do the planning and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2016, they published this article
using nascent RNA in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first study that was
performed on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really disappointed at the time
because they say, in plants, there is lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of enhancer RNAs, lack of bi-directional
transcription, lack of promoter proximal
[SPEAKER_00]: paucine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are completely different than
mammals and other metazoans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really sad because we were in the
middle of an experiment trying to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: these enhancers using the enhancer RNAs
that, according to these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: were completely absent in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were in the middle of the
experiment, so we just kept going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll explain a little bit of these
metagen plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what will happen in the human
around the transcription star site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the polymerase first
attaches and then starts transcribing in
[SPEAKER_00]: this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have the transcription of the
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this peak at the beginning is called
the paucine phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where basically the polymerases are
attached to the beginning of the gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are just waiting for an
additional stimuli to start transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there is this bi-directional
transcription on the stable RNA in the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arabidopsis, however, they observed two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no paucine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no bi-directional
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were in the middle of the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that sometimes when you try to
understand a new molecular technique,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better thing to understand it is go
through the protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will just walk you guys through the
protocol a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GROSSEQ or PROSSEQ are a goal for
global or precision random sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this method does is it will
sequence RNA that are attached to the
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase inside the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start with a plant cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to extract the nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will only have the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have the nucleus, you disrupt the
nuclear membrane, remove the nucleotides,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original nucleotides, and put lots of
biotinylated entities into the solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let the conditions of the cell
culture so that the polymerase will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to incorporate these nucleotides at
least to position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then since those NTPs are biotinylated,
you will just use streptavidin to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just follow the steps to
create a regular NGS library.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will end up with a strand-specific
nascent RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first result we wanted to check was
that if the things observed in Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: were the same as we were observing in
Casaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that we observed is
that the Casaba nascent RNA profile around
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription star site is a hybrid
between Arabidopsis and tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, there is paucine, evidence by
this peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is lack of bidirectional
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to the termination site,
or sorry, the polyadenylation site at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the gene, then we see that the
Casaba profile looks quite similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, the humans don't have this peak
at the end of the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the start of the gene looks
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look for the end of the gene,
it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that the Arabidopsis
people say that was that there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: paucine implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Casaba, we found paucine
implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say there is no bidirectional
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of saw this little bump here
and say, OK, let's try to find some genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have this bidirectional
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I found some examples that
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an IgB image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the nascent RNAseq reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene is going in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the paucine peak and the
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have this bidirectional
transcription in the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was bidirectional transcription,
at least in Casaba, in a way less amount
[SPEAKER_00]: that was observed in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked myself, what if Casaba can have
bidirectional transcription, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: some genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they still have enhanced RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I annotate peaks in intergenic regions
first using chromatin immunoprecipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: peak color in Homer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this pattern of bidirectional
transcription across these elements that
[SPEAKER_00]: were outside genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say, OK, maybe if I found those
elements, I can still run the support
[SPEAKER_00]: vector regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regression model that was training
mammals to identify transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory elements outside the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I found 9,665 elements that were
transcribed outside the gene having these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of look like enhancers at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to further characterize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some methylation that are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to plot the methylation in the
3D model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a random set of regions across the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how methylation looks in Casaba
in the CHH context, in the CpG context,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the CHG context.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pattern that you observe
across genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really low methylation in the promoter and
in the termination and CpG methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the elements that we
found outside genes had this methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to what is observed in genes,
but a little inflated for methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was interested also in checking how
conserved these elements were.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, enhancer had to be conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in yellow, you see these are GERB
scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the higher the GERB score,
the more conserved those regions are
[SPEAKER_00]: across closely related species,
including Jatropha, Flux, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, again, from 0% to 100% of
the features we're analyzing, yellow is
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, super conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is random sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in orange, it was our enhancer
candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we observe here that they are actually
non-conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I read this research that was done
2016, I believe, where they studied
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer evolution across 20 mammalian
species and then found that mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancers are rapidly evolving sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quoting them, enhancers are rarely
conserved across these mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbiased mapping leaks candidate enhancers
with lineage-specific positive selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of evidence on top of
evidence that this thing that we found
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually be enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last test that we want to try is,
OK, if the enhancers might be important to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain a phenotype, they should be
explaining more phenotypic variants in
[SPEAKER_00]: populations for, for example, yield
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a portion of my genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that the whole circle is the
Casaba genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a small portion, 1%, of the genome
is represented by these enhancer candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did is select all the markers
inside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I LD protected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any marker that would have an R squared
higher than 0.9 in a 150k region across
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I would just close them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will build another kernel with
the rest of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will compare what I have here with
my null hypothesis of a random set of
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that have the same distribution of
the enhancer that I found, also protected
[SPEAKER_00]: by a 4LD and the second kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we found, when we run the genomic
partitioning and the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic variants, that is explained for
several traits on the enhancer regions on
[SPEAKER_00]: blue to random regions in orange,
it is for most of the traits, dry matter
[SPEAKER_00]: content, fresh yield, root number,
root weight, and shoot weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are explaining way more phenotypic
variants than the random set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only trait that this is not working is
for CMD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dot is hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense because CMD is
regulated by most probably a single locus
[SPEAKER_00]: with a massive QTL chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've made a case where we found
these elements outside genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trans scribe are not evolutionary
conserved, have a specific methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, and explain more phenotypic
variants than its random counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of think that these might be
enhancers, and this will be a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: method to identify them in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a big, big, big,
big team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to Uganda, actually,
I really understood the effort that is put
[SPEAKER_00]: into getting one of your data cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
