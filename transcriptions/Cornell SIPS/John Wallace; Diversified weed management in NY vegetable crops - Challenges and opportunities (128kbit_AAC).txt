[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just told Greg I needed to apologize
that this is a veggie focus talk so my
[SPEAKER_01]: appointment is all specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on working in perennial perennial
fruits and small fruits as well but I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say my thinking is a little more
mature when it comes to what I might do in
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than kind of walk through and
give you the details of what I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing, what I've already started,
maybe what I've done in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it might be a good approach to
share with you kind of how I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: weed management problems in a more general
way and kind of dive into some concepts or
[SPEAKER_01]: some theories that really inform my
thinking about weed management and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my plan and we'll see I typically
talk to extension audience and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really dive into theory when you're
talking to growers but I thought this
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a nice opportunity to do some of
that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know you would think that you know
there's really only one goal when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to weed management and that's we want to
kill as many weeds as possible but there
[SPEAKER_01]: is some underlying theory and how we
design tactics to do that and from an
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology standpoint we have broader goals
as far as what we want to get out of our
[SPEAKER_01]: weed management programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to maintain low population
equilibrium densities and weed seed banks
[SPEAKER_01]: and our emerged populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to avoid population peaks so we
want to avoid bad years where we have you
[SPEAKER_01]: know huge yield loss and and huge weed
seed rain events especially in arable
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and then also we want to use
tactics that prevent us from seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptations so specific weeds becoming
adapted to our systems or specific weed
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and so if that's the primary
goal there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this we kind of have this
organizing framework called weed community
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly and this has been around for for
years a couple scientists Rich Smith up in
[SPEAKER_01]: New Hampshire and Dave Mortenson at Penn
State have recently put a little different
[SPEAKER_01]: spin on weed community assembly by
connecting kind of the ecological niche
[SPEAKER_01]: theory that underlines this framework with
kind of successional ecologists that we
[SPEAKER_01]: call ecology or disturbance the
disturbance framework and they the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they conceptualize that is the way that
weed communities come about they go
[SPEAKER_01]: through a series of filters and so you
know in kind of classical ecology we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about the niche theory as a series of an
abiotic filter that constrains populations
[SPEAKER_01]: due to limiting environments or
disturbance or particular soil types and
[SPEAKER_01]: biotic filters right so the interactions
between species top down bottom up but in
[SPEAKER_01]: the arable system so in a in a you know
highly managed system there's these
[SPEAKER_01]: additional filters that we think about so
the cropping system filter and the
[SPEAKER_01]: management filter and they're hierarchical
so the higher level filters constrain the
[SPEAKER_01]: communities that pass through and then
also kind of constrain what options we
[SPEAKER_01]: have for management at lower levels so if
we think about what the important factors
[SPEAKER_01]: are and this is not an exhaustive list of
kind of what encompasses these filters but
[SPEAKER_01]: when I think about this hierarchical
filter here I think about the factors that
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to the weed species pool that
we have at the field level and so that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: function of both propical pressure so
species coming into the environment seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank legacies of annual weeds and then
perhaps shifting climate patterns we see
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that already occurring as we see
some new species meaning moving north and
[SPEAKER_01]: latitude propical pressure is a big one
now typically we think that it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed bank legacy that matters but with
this kind of emerging problem of herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant weeds they're getting spread
over the region propical pressure is an
[SPEAKER_01]: important important factor so the cropping
system so that's really what is the design
[SPEAKER_01]: of your crop rotation how many crops you
have in rotation what are their life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles winter annual summer annuals their
growing season length the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility inputs that are particular to
that system and then really this is this
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of the important one so when we
think about kind of the management filter
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where we kill the weeds right and
so typically we're either using herbicides
[SPEAKER_01]: broad spectrum herbicides selective
herbicides or tillage and cultivation or a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination those those tools and these
are high disturbance intensity and
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency events and so those create the
very conditions in which weeds are adapted
[SPEAKER_01]: to so weeds become adapted to disturbance
and they also are adapted to these events
[SPEAKER_01]: which which we see spikes in available
resources and so you have this filter
[SPEAKER_01]: below it and this is really the internal
internal dynamics this is the this is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the ecology happens the crop
competition bottom-up top-down level
[SPEAKER_01]: processes and so if we're thinking about
achieving those goals of preventing
[SPEAKER_01]: adapted species in our system what we
really need to do is lower the intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: of these disturbance events so rely less
on herbicides or tillage the combination
[SPEAKER_01]: of both and rely more on these filters
above that process these processes so at
[SPEAKER_01]: the cropping system level by diversifying
crops in the rotation the life cycles that
[SPEAKER_01]: we use and then also increasing kind of
the biotic potential control levels so
[SPEAKER_01]: once you start tinkering with the cropping
system to only achieve a weed management
[SPEAKER_01]: objective that's where you run into issues
because once you start doing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: start tinkering with that type of thing
you are influencing other components of
[SPEAKER_01]: the system that we care about so that's
why when we think about taking that type
[SPEAKER_01]: of diversified weed management approach
it's important to look at that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of kind of the entire system and
so using kind of the agro ecology system
[SPEAKER_01]: framework is really important for doing
that so you know agro ecology principles
[SPEAKER_01]: are really based on just minimizing or
reducing external inputs and relying more
[SPEAKER_01]: on natural processes or ecological
processes to achieve both pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: objectives and and soil management or
fertility management objectives so if
[SPEAKER_01]: we're changing tactics to to manage weeds
in order to really enhance biotic pest
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation we may be producing trade-offs
for other components of the system that we
[SPEAKER_01]: care about so increasing soil quality
increasing the efficiency of cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients water conservation all those
factors and so the way I see it is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know thinking about designing new ways to
manage weeds diversifying weed management
[SPEAKER_01]: tactics the response of the weeds is just
there's one response it's really a
[SPEAKER_01]: multivariate response surface that
includes dynamics related to soils and
[SPEAKER_01]: other pests and so these are these are the
goals that we think about when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about adopting more agro
ecologically based pests and fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: management and this is the one I think
about a lot these days and that's how do
[SPEAKER_01]: we design systems that are resilient that
have capacity to adapt to disturbance and
[SPEAKER_01]: so we think about this a lot in terms of
climate change so systems that that can
[SPEAKER_01]: adapt to changes in the climate but also
it could be to new pests so that are
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient against new pest problems so if
that's the goal for you know if the goal
[SPEAKER_01]: is to design and evaluate weed management
practices that accomplish those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: objectives that's much different than
traditional weed science work and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know we can if we're thinking
about evaluating a new herbicide product
[SPEAKER_01]: we can pretty confidently come up with
what we think is the response from a weed
[SPEAKER_01]: community standpoint this particular
herbicide controls these weed species with
[SPEAKER_01]: similar functional traits but if we're
using diverse tactics we're creating a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of trade-offs and I think that's the real
challenge for incorporating that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: research into an extension program and
that how do you how do you evaluate what
[SPEAKER_01]: those trade-offs are how do you prioritize
what the trade-offs are and then how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you communicate you know how do we think
about those trade-offs to a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: audience and the other thing is that the
processes that play out are really just
[SPEAKER_01]: they're context dependent because the
ecology of each system is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different and it's going to produce a
series of different trade-offs so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: really a high level of context dependency
and so we don't get that predictable
[SPEAKER_01]: response that we might see with a
herbicide if we're using diverse tactics
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think that's that's something I think
about and I think it's you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: moving into kind of a new era of extension
weed science research away from herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: based programs and so thinking about what
a good extension program looks like around
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse weed management tactics is is you
know a challenge okay so I mentioned this
[SPEAKER_01]: this idea that we're thinking about
building agro ecosystems that are
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient they have the adaptive capacity
to disturbance whether climate or or
[SPEAKER_01]: related to pests and I've been thinking
about food system resilience lately and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that really just broadens our thinking
related to agro ecosystems system
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience to kind of socio-economic
processes and so the goal of food system
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience is not just to it's not about
production but also about access to foods
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it couples the production process
with distribution channels and ties that
[SPEAKER_01]: to the consumer and it's all about if
we're going to have resilient food systems
[SPEAKER_01]: people need to have access to the
diversity of products and it really points
[SPEAKER_01]: towards redesigning our systems around
kind of locally or regionally food
[SPEAKER_01]: economies and so you know if you look at
the factors or the processes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to contribute to food system
resilience it's not just increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in our agro ecosystems but also
increasing diversity of distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: networks increase dietary diversity so
they're thinking about nutrient dense
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy food systems and so the reason why
I've been thinking about this is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started off talking about the hierarchy of
management filters that cropping system
[SPEAKER_01]: filter really shapes what we have as far
as available management tools for weed
[SPEAKER_01]: management and decisions at that level are
driven by economics they're driven by do
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a market for that particular crop
it may make sense from breaking pest
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles or increasing soil quality but it's
it's a non-starter if it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: economic sense and so this this kind of
framework presents kind of a normative
[SPEAKER_01]: case for redesigning a system that
diversity is really the core focus so that
[SPEAKER_01]: that might seem fairly academic
[SPEAKER_01]: in some respects it may still be but
there's this really interesting book that
[SPEAKER_01]: was published by Laura Langnick a couple
years ago it's called resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and she went around the
country and talked to she talked to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of leading edge growers across all types
of production systems so field crops
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables food production systems and
asked how they think about designing their
[SPEAKER_01]: system and in the context of resiliency in
the face of changing climate and the way
[SPEAKER_01]: she summarized almost all the growers when
they talked about resilience they talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about resilience from kind of an agro
ecosystem standpoint so introducing crop
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity they all prioritized practices
that built soil quality but they also
[SPEAKER_01]: identified these economic components so
access to high value markets diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: capital assets and so I've been thinking
about that so you know what are what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the advantages and disadvantages and
challenges and opportunities in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: if that is a long-term goal to build more
resilience in our food systems and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody knows New York is a wonderfully
diverse state when it comes to the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of agricultural products that we produce
and so built into that is this
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure this capital infrastructure
that supports all these products we have
[SPEAKER_01]: the distribution channels the value chain
and it's and it's pretty heterogeneous
[SPEAKER_01]: spatially so up in around Geneva it's
pretty easy to go from a dairy farm to a
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard to a vegetable crop system within
just a month or two and so that
[SPEAKER_01]: heterogeneity perhaps presents some real
opportunities the other thing New York has
[SPEAKER_01]: going for it of course is it's it's got
some comparative advantage when we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about location of the consumer so being
being in the northeast close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: eastern seaboard where we have a very
large percentage of our consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: population is another advantage and we're
thinking about this so you know I'm a big
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of the work that Christian Peters did
here about a decade ago thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: these this concept of food sheds in New
York and so there's there's kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of some thinking along those
lines and we see that popping up in
[SPEAKER_01]: different different areas as far as
thinking about local aggregation regional
[SPEAKER_01]: food networks in New York so I just wanted
to try to put a finer you know provide
[SPEAKER_01]: some examples I guess of what that might
look like and I you know I haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere where I would like to see in
New York yet but I've seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting operations and I just wanted
to point out a couple which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrate kind of a local adaptation to
what I consider kind of this resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking and so both of these examples are
just down the road from the experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: station in Geneva maybe two or two or
three miles away and so here's one example
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the Hemdale farms so Dale Heminger
just outside of Geneva and the Heminger's
[SPEAKER_01]: operate at 1200 cal dairy and they're very
invested in technology so they are moving
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more of their production system
to robotic milking parlors so they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: rely less on labor and then they also
specialize in specialty crops and really
[SPEAKER_01]: cabbage so these this operation is
diversified it's a dairy and it
[SPEAKER_01]: specializes in cabbage I didn't know of
any dairy cabbage slash cabbage operations
[SPEAKER_01]: before I came to New York but that level
of diversification is really important so
[SPEAKER_01]: right now there's tremendous flux in
northeastern dairies no prices are really
[SPEAKER_01]: low and small dairy producers are really
struggling right now and so you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about how from both an economics from an
economic standpoint diversification
[SPEAKER_01]: provides some resistance so operations
like the Heminger's are probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to ride out those periods of low
milk prices and also that level of
[SPEAKER_01]: diversification also it makes sense
because they've worked out really closing
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycling loops so manure is going
back out onto fields ahead of cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: they're heavily invested in soil quality
practices integrating cover crops reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage so when we think about what that
previous slide what makes systems of
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience crop diversity crop diversity
prioritizing soil quality diverse capital
[SPEAKER_01]: assets I think I think the Hemdale farms
is a good a good example of that the other
[SPEAKER_01]: one is Rick Peterson the Peterson family
farms just down the road from Dale and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's very diversified I'm not sure how
many total acres he has but he really
[SPEAKER_01]: specializes in fresh market vegetable
production also grows field crops he's in
[SPEAKER_01]: close proximity to a lot of dairies in the
area so he can he can sell field crops
[SPEAKER_01]: locally he's also one of the largest hop
growers in New York and he is starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow more and more small grains winter
grains in his rotation molting barley
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid rye those types of small grains and
his operations is about 50% certified
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and the other 50% is non-gmo crops
so here he's diversified in the crops he
[SPEAKER_01]: grows and then also premium markets so he
has access to these really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: premium markets and he just like Dale is
very heavily invested in kind of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: building practices so he thinks about and
integrates a cover crop wherever you can
[SPEAKER_01]: in the rotation and he's he doesn't do no
till but he's very serious about reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: the intensity of tillage system so he does
this low till kind of practice so to tie
[SPEAKER_01]: those things together so the way I'm
thinking about designing a research and
[SPEAKER_01]: extension program around developing
diversified weed management systems is at
[SPEAKER_01]: two levels and it kind of corresponds to
the community assembly framework I shared
[SPEAKER_01]: with you so at the lower level I'm going
to be thinking about developing a diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: set of weed control tactics so combining
combining things like herbicides reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage cover crops with the goal of kind
of the overall goal of minimizing external
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs where we can and then also making
sure that the combination of those tactics
[SPEAKER_01]: still produce robust weed control outcomes
and then also thinking about all those
[SPEAKER_01]: agro ecosystem trade-offs so understanding
and evaluating what those trade-offs might
[SPEAKER_01]: be related to new tactics and then at kind
of a higher level I'm also want to work in
[SPEAKER_01]: the development of more diversified
cropping system practices that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: build on the strengths of New York and the
diversity of ag that we have as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of you know understanding and
utilizing some of the local adaptation
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already going on like the
Peterson farm or or or the Hemdale farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and then thinking thinking about both you
know ecological and economic resilience by
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of using agro ecology practices
[SPEAKER_01]: so I thought I thought that I would run
through an example of my previous work at
[SPEAKER_01]: Penn State that kind of illustrates some
of these concepts to kind of put a finer
[SPEAKER_01]: point on that so I was at Penn State as a
postdoc for three and a half years prior
[SPEAKER_01]: to coming here and principally my
responsibilities was as a project
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinator for this long-term cropping
systems experiment at Penn State it was
[SPEAKER_01]: called the reduced till organic systems
experiment or Rose and I came in to this
[SPEAKER_01]: project it was in its third year so it had
almost completed one three-year rotation
[SPEAKER_01]: and then kind of helped the product
project transition into another funding
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle where we kind of redesigned the
system a little bit but the overarching
[SPEAKER_01]: objective of this project was thinking
about how we can reduce the intensity or
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency of tillage in organic annual
field crop rotation and so when we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about these high disturbance weed control
tactics organic field crop production is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty classic case so we rely on
intensive inversion tillage followed by
[SPEAKER_01]: frequent cultivation events to manage
weeds and so those are the conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: where we create adapted weed species or
adapted weed communities and so the
[SPEAKER_01]: project was really about how do we
diversify our tactics and move away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that high intensity high frequency kind of
weed management practices so the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: did that was by integrating and relying
more on biotic weed control measures and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the way we did that was by growing
really high biomass cover crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling them down with the roller crimper
and planting cash crops into the rolled
[SPEAKER_01]: killed cover crop and so this is just an
example we did this both in corn and in
[SPEAKER_01]: soybean and so in front of corn we would
grow hairy vetch and triticale mixture and
[SPEAKER_01]: we would roll that down and no till plant
field corn into it and then in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: soybeans we would plant cereal rye allow
cereal rye to get really big roll that
[SPEAKER_01]: down and plant soybeans into that rolled
mulch and so here we're moving away from
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive tillage inversion tillage and
we're moving away from in crop cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least frequent in crop cultivation
and relying on this biotic weed control
[SPEAKER_01]: measure and then we also looked at
integrating tactics so in combination with
[SPEAKER_01]: growing high residue cover crops we used
high residue cultivation and so high
[SPEAKER_01]: residue cultivation it's it doesn't invert
the soil so it leaves the residue on top
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas traditional cultivation would kill
weeds by really mixing soil between the
[SPEAKER_01]: rows so cultivation high residue
cultivation is these broad flat sweeps
[SPEAKER_01]: that allow you to come in not invert the
soil but sever roots of weeds so we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at that in combination with
different levels of residue and so the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we were getting that is by delaying
termination so if we terminated earlier we
[SPEAKER_01]: would be working with lower levels of
cover crop biomass and so you can see this
[SPEAKER_01]: is we terminated late we had lots of
biomass here we terminated about three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks earlier in this case lower levels of
biomass you can see we have already
[SPEAKER_01]: established the cash crop so here's some
of the results from that study we just
[SPEAKER_01]: published some of this work in weed
science and so I'm just going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the soybeans just to kind of
narrow down down the story so we we
[SPEAKER_01]: replicated these studies at three
different locations in the mid-atlantic
[SPEAKER_01]: Delaware Maryland and Pennsylvania and on
the x-axis here you have this would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: different termination dates so as you move
across the x-axis you'd be getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: later termination dates where we have
greater levels of biomass and then the two
[SPEAKER_01]: shades of gray are with or without
cultivation and so you know we can run
[SPEAKER_01]: this through some null hypothesis testing
and you were able to separate some means
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think just looking at the effect
size average across years and locations is
[SPEAKER_01]: really more informative because it points
to one of the challenges that I suggested
[SPEAKER_01]: at the beginning of the talk and that we
see the response of these the response to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really location specific so we didn't
see the same trend with the laying
[SPEAKER_01]: terminations across three sites we saw
each location really had its unique
[SPEAKER_01]: response to those tactics so that's that's
one take home and then I think the other
[SPEAKER_01]: take home is you know we had a more
consistent response at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: directionality maybe not magnitude by with
the high residue cultivation in comparison
[SPEAKER_01]: to delaying termination dates and so
that's pretty typical in what we see that
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a more robust response in using a
herbicide or using a cultivator then we
[SPEAKER_01]: would see in relying on kind of a biotic
control measure like cover crops so the
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing we're interested in looking at
is all the trade-offs that were associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with this so you know we were we were
delaying termination so that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: three-week delay between the early
termination and the late termination and
[SPEAKER_01]: we are generating different levels of
cover crop biomass and so you can imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: that this create potentially creates
trade-offs related to other pests and so
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the pests that we identified
identified as a trade-off was there was
[SPEAKER_01]: this interaction with termination date and
the level of termination efficacy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: roller crimper and so when we terminated
later we we were terminating cereal rye
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that eventually would produce
mature seed and we started dealing more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more as we followed the rotation with
volunteer cover crops and so this this
[SPEAKER_01]: panel here is just the rank abundance of
the wheat community and the seed banks and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see between the two different
planting dates as we as we delay
[SPEAKER_01]: termination all of a sudden we get cereal
rye popping up as the primary species for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most abundant species in the weed seed
bank and that produced effects in the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequent cash crop so when we terminated
late and we sampled the winter wheat crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that followed we saw higher levels of
grain contamination so if you're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: winter wheat as a cash grain and you take
to an elevator you're gonna get docked at
[SPEAKER_01]: the elevator for for having that level of
contamination so that was one pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management trade-off another pest
management trade-off was related to the
[SPEAKER_01]: insect community so we were tracking both
predatory arthropods and also early season
[SPEAKER_01]: insect pests and so this is a structural
equation model that I was fitting to each
[SPEAKER_01]: site and each cash crop where we were
trying to identify what the yield limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factors were and what the interactions
were between these different variables in
[SPEAKER_01]: the system and so at Pennsylvania when we
delayed the planting day we were
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing cover crop biomass but we were
also decreasing the number of predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: arthropods we had in the community and and
you know in organic system we're relying
[SPEAKER_01]: on those predatory arthropods for
biological control early season insects so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this dynamic where weed control
tactics are influenced by balancing pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management of different pests one more
trade-off and again so and the other thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is all these things that I'm highlighting
and all the structural equation models
[SPEAKER_01]: were really coming out to be very location
specific and so the dynamics that were
[SPEAKER_01]: playing out were vastly different so this
example is from the Maryland location and
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is one of the one of the issues
that we thought we would see but we only
[SPEAKER_01]: saw at the Maryland location is that when
you delay termination to really get more
[SPEAKER_01]: weed suppression out of your cover crops
you have more issues with consistent stand
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment so it's just tougher to get
a no-till drill through higher levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and you run into issues of not
being able to open and close the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: furrow reduced stands and so we actually
saw that to be the case at the Maryland
[SPEAKER_01]: location where cover crop biomass
increased soybean populations decreased so
[SPEAKER_01]: again I'm just providing all these
examples to really demonstrate that while
[SPEAKER_01]: diversifying weed control tactics is a
really important goal if we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop and evaluate those tactics we have
to take really a multivariate approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: that research and understand what all the
what is doing to all the components of the
[SPEAKER_02]: system so it's it's that's a good question
the question was about the roller the
[SPEAKER_01]: roller crimper how does actually kill the
cover top so it kills it in two ways shear
[SPEAKER_01]: weight and then it actually crimps the
stems in multiple locations so that
[SPEAKER_01]: Chevron pattern it's going to crimp the
vascular tissue and and if it's if the
[SPEAKER_01]: rise standing up nice and tall it's going
to crimp it in three or four spots but it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't always kill it yeah it's it's it's
the termination efficacy is related to the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenology of cereal rye and that is the
grain contamination related to grains that
[SPEAKER_01]: do survive this roller crimping process
yes well yeah so if you terminate too late
[SPEAKER_01]: yet you're at a point if you're adding
thesis and if it doesn't you don't get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good kill it goes you know the seed
matures yeah yeah okay so then we
[SPEAKER_01]: transition into the next three years and
this is really I started really managing a
[SPEAKER_01]: project at this point and so we we kind of
made some adaptations based on what we
[SPEAKER_01]: learned in the first three years and one
of that one of the changes we made was to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get around the trade-offs related
to having high levels of weed suppressive
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop mulch but also making sure that
we can establish the cash crop and so we
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the way in which we were roller
crimping we went away from the large
[SPEAKER_01]: roller crimper and went to these
integrated rollers that run ahead of a
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till planter and had these really
heavier duty row cleaners and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: did was opened up consistently opened up a
wider furrow for us to get the seed furrow
[SPEAKER_01]: open and closed and we are still using
high residue cultivation we're using it
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptively we didn't have a no cultivation
cultivation treatment and the treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did change is we actually moved
and we had this no-till soybean phase and
[SPEAKER_01]: in a different system we managed the
soybeans as a tilled system using kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional techniques so moldboard plow
ahead of the cash crop this is out of
[SPEAKER_01]: order you would line cultivate before the
crop is up and then to our cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: several times and so we were comparing
what are the trade-offs between the
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till system and the full tillage system
in this case so here's some of the data
[SPEAKER_01]: this is somewhat preliminary we're done
are the three years have been completed
[SPEAKER_01]: master student Rebecca champagne just
finished up on that and so this is total
[SPEAKER_01]: weed biomass compared to the no-till
system and the tilled system in soybeans
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you can see that we got pretty
comparable levels of weed suppression and
[SPEAKER_01]: I should note that we have different
standards in organic field crops anything
[SPEAKER_01]: below a thousand kilograms per hectare is
pretty good that's probably not what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're shooting for in a conventional
system vegetables you definitely can't
[SPEAKER_01]: handle that level of weed pressure but
where we did see some differences which
[SPEAKER_01]: was interesting we started collecting data
our weed data between the row and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: row because we really had different
between the tilled system and the no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: system we had different mechanisms going
on and we saw a difference we saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater proportion of the total weed
biomass was in the row and the tilled
[SPEAKER_01]: system so I the other thing I think is
important is again we're not decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: about what type of approach we're going to
adopt may not be driven by weed control
[SPEAKER_01]: performance in some respects they may be
driven by how variable these systems are
[SPEAKER_01]: from year to year so we may prioritize a
system where we see less weed control
[SPEAKER_01]: failures over a five or ten year period
and so one of the things that we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do is to partition the variance out of
the weed biomass to understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: factors are contributing to the
variability that we see in total weed
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and so this is the tilled system
between the row and in the row the no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: system between the row and in the row and
these are factors in a multiple regression
[SPEAKER_01]: and these are this is semi-partial
correlation so you can think of it as the
[SPEAKER_01]: unique contribution to the variance for
each of these factors and so I just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to point out you know a couple things that
we saw was the seabank legacy seemed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more important in the tilled system in the
highly disturbed system for both between
[SPEAKER_01]: the row and in the row than the no-till
system so that's that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern that popped out there we saw a
pretty predictable response for in a row
[SPEAKER_01]: where the main contributor to the
variability was how well we did as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: crop standing establishment which makes
sense the crops in the row they were more
[SPEAKER_01]: weed suppressive they can't be closed
sooner and that's what drove variability
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tilled system but environmental
conditions so just the year-to-year
[SPEAKER_01]: variability is what really drove weed
control performance in the no-till system
[SPEAKER_01]: which is interesting because I think what
it really is is the soil conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: how much disturbance we really did with
those row cleaners that was really driving
[SPEAKER_01]: the response and weed pressure and so if
we can identify where that variability is
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can make modifications to the
system to address the variability okay I
[SPEAKER_01]: better finish up I'm gonna run through
this so that was the weed control tactics
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I'm gonna have to run through the
diversified cropping practices quickly so
[SPEAKER_01]: even if we're you know we have those
events and it's often the case in our
[SPEAKER_01]: organic systems where we have high weed
seeder rain events we have some weed
[SPEAKER_01]: control failures like this example with
giant foxtail and this this year in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beans this is where the rotation the
cropping system comes in so we're rotating
[SPEAKER_01]: to a winter annual cash crop and we want
to harvest a profitable crop in this case
[SPEAKER_01]: but we one of the principal factors that's
going on here is it potentially we want it
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive weed seed banks down so we want
to utilize that where you know we'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: winter in your lifecycle to drive down
weed seed banks so that we can go back
[SPEAKER_01]: into summer annual or profitable cash crop
but we are also interested in well can we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that and still reduce the intensity
of tillage in that phase of the rotation
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had a system where we actually no
till planted spelt into soybean stubble
[SPEAKER_01]: and we supplied the fertility by using
manure injection and then frost seeded
[SPEAKER_01]: with a high with a no till drill our cover
crop into the winter grain so we had the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop there when we took off the
grain and that was a defoliation event
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a weed management tactic or weed
control tactic and then we either took a
[SPEAKER_01]: forge cut or adaptively managed it and
mowed it to eliminate weed seed production
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had systems where with different
levels of intensity as far as tillage goes
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had a system where we had a
moldboard plow ahead of the spelt and then
[SPEAKER_01]: also ahead of the cover crop we had a
system where we reduced the intensity with
[SPEAKER_01]: the chisel plow all the way down to this
system I just described the word for two
[SPEAKER_01]: years we had no tillage in the system and
this is what the weed seed banks look like
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can see in each one of the systems
in both in two different starts we were
[SPEAKER_01]: driving weed seed banks down a lot of
variability but in each case regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: the intensity of tillage weed seed banks
were declining which indicates that this
[SPEAKER_01]: may be a phase of the cropping system
where we can reduce intensity of tillage
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency of tillage and still manage weed
seed banks I'm going to skip this one just
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can wrap up so just to bring it back
to kind of my plan I guess and so just to
[SPEAKER_01]: summarize and I think this is a rough plan
this is an evolving plan but I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about if we think about kind of
the original weed community assembly the
[SPEAKER_01]: goal is to reduce the intensity those high
intensity weed control events and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what that would be one of the goals
of my research and so that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-pronged approach includes herbicide
stewardship so we're using right herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: at the right time at the right rate
there's opportunities for precision weed
[SPEAKER_01]: control using precision ag technology
that's coming along very interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced tillage practices a news program
has done a lot of great work in this area
[SPEAKER_01]: which I hope I can I can work with her on
and then developing these biotic based
[SPEAKER_01]: weed control tactics so thinking about how
we can effectively integrate cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: into the rotation what that means for
other weed control tactics like herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and then finally evaluating
and developing different kind of cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: system level diversification strategies
and so my first I went big for my first
[SPEAKER_01]: grant proposal I just just submitted an
OREI I submitted an OREI with Mark Searles
[SPEAKER_01]: and Gary Bergstrom and Sarah Petherbridge
and Miguel Gomez and so that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at thinking about ecological
resilience and economic resilience by
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing these high value winter annual
grains that Mark has been working on his
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding programs so the heritage grains
the ancient grains he's been working on
[SPEAKER_01]: melting barley all these winter grains
have premium markets they have secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: premium secondary markets feed feed grade
quality grains and so the economics
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially makes sense and then we want
to look at where the cultural practices
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of increase ecological
resilience in vegetable crop rotations so
[SPEAKER_01]: I about talked through the entire time but
I'll stop there and hopefully take a
[SPEAKER_01]: question or two thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva first all right there any questions
from Geneva
[SPEAKER_01]: did you see any shifts in the either
species composition or functional type
[SPEAKER_02]: composition in your weed communities in
relation to any of your control strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah we so the question was about
shifts in either community composition or
[SPEAKER_01]: the functional traits so that last slide
you know this we have a really good ET
[SPEAKER_01]: Bank data for these last three years and
so I'm just starting to dive into the
[SPEAKER_01]: community level analysis and the first
shot at this particular analysis indicated
[SPEAKER_01]: that we weren't seeing dramatic shifts in
the weed community between in that phase
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rotation along a disturbance
tillage gradient and I think it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: for two reasons one is there's a pretty
well-established seed bank legacy at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point and the other reason is we might not
have sampled at the intended density we
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to to identify a shift in weed
communities I actually think that when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes the weed community question is
interesting from an ecological standpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: if we see a shift in the community but my
what happens is you get a lot of innocuous
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds in the weed community that may be
jumping out and indicate you know showing
[SPEAKER_01]: a shift personally in speed well that's
not a species that's going to be yielded
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting so I think I what I was doing was
pulling out weed species that we knew we
[SPEAKER_01]: know to be abundance and potentially yield
limiting in the in the corn crop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next phase of the rotation and looking at
seed bank shifts transition rates so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's a better approach would be to
look at functional traits so mid season
[SPEAKER_01]: summer annual weed species what are they
what are they doing rather than looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for a shift so we're out of time but
anyone who has further questions or would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to dialogue with Professor Wallace
think you'll be around for a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and speak to it thank you this has been a
production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_00]: web at Cornell edu you
