[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, thanks, Lynn, for that wonderful
introduction and for decades of friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: and professional collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the opportunity to share
our research program at the Danforth
[SPEAKER_00]: Center with Cornell and everyone who's
doing some fantastic plant science here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see some familiar faces,
some familiar references to Cornell folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lynn said, I'm the director of the
x-ray imaging facility at the Danforth
[SPEAKER_00]: Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are not already aware,
the Danforth Center is the world's largest
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofit independent plant science
research institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the fortunate position to
really look into a lot of issues in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: science, especially food security,
that other places don't really have the
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom or the support to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a research scientist in Dr. Chris
Top's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is the PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started the lab in 2013 using
phenotyping to look at root biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has expanded to include not only
roots and genetics, but everything
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a wide range of expertise that
we share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I expect, many of you here are
starting to realize that no one lab will
[SPEAKER_00]: have nearly enough expertise to get
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must find ways to work with your
colleagues to really pull more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science out of all these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the list on the left,
plant genotypes and genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, my background in microscopy
and imaging, there's cell biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's ag engineering, chemical
engineering, and perhaps most importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: is computational science, because all the
beautiful images are mostly just greeting
[SPEAKER_00]: cards until we can actually pull some of
that biological information back out the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of these really cool 3D volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple different headings today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lab based x ray microscopy,
as opposed to working at a synchrotron.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab base makes it very, very
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's of course, trade offs compared to
synchrotron imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll cover x ray tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks often say it's micro CT or nano CT
or macro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's just the resolution you're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an x ray tomography instrument,
we have an x ray microscope, which
[SPEAKER_00]: generates images in a slightly different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's specific application in volume
electron microscopy, that is using XRM as
[SPEAKER_00]: a roadmap to show you where in your resin
block you want to go for organelle level
[SPEAKER_00]: volume imaging with with a serial block
face SEM or a fibsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrumentation that does tomography
at the nanometer scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some really sort of exciting
pioneering work looking at mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi in situ, which is a really big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been recently getting into
looking at x ray imaging of field soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to see what can we understand about
the 3D structure of soil at multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, coming up on eight years
this August, we took delivery of a large
[SPEAKER_00]: format industrial scale x ray tomography
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a collaboration with valent
biosciences who make a lot of of
[SPEAKER_00]: biorationals and mycorrhizal products for
the commercial market in addition to part
[SPEAKER_00]: of an NSF grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these large scale industrial
instruments are frequently found in
[SPEAKER_00]: automotive and aerospace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boeing will probably have a dozen of these
to look at aircraft parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do non destructive imaging of
aircraft parts to confirm that they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having taken two different flights to
get here, I'm glad they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the parts are working,
but they have to certify that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have very large cabinets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can handle very heavy weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of interior space to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the advantages that we
found in the large format instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick review of how we generate image
data using x ray tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: The setup is relatively straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an x ray source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample sits on a turntable in the middle
and you have a detector which collects the
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We broadcast x rays through the sample
that impinges on the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll rotate that turntable over typically
360 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll collect thousands of images from
around all those angles and then
[SPEAKER_00]: computationally reassemble all those
images into a 3D volume that we can now
[SPEAKER_00]: explore electronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the animations that you'll see
today, certainly the colorful ones were
[SPEAKER_00]: done by my senior technician, Clara Lebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been developing her undergraduate
degree in art, her master's degree in
[SPEAKER_00]: electron microscopy and combining them to
really make some stunning and striking
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of presenting these 3D volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The practical offshoot is we can study
these things without tearing them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to count every seed inside
this pepper, you could do that digitally
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to hack it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the very first work we did was
actually in collaboration with Jason Mondo
[SPEAKER_00]: who's at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're online there,
Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provided hundreds of grape rachises.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the stems left behind after the
berries of the grape are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to improve grape
varieties, you can't just focus on making
[SPEAKER_00]: big berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand the underlying 3D
architecture of what's going to hold those
[SPEAKER_00]: berries and the enormous amount of
variability that already exists in these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly with our eyes, we can look at
all the different grape bunches and see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're very, very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we quantify these differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we scanned hundreds of
these grape rachises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are fortunate enough to work
with an applied mathematician like Mao Li,
[SPEAKER_00]: whose one of her expertise areas is
looking at topology.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you evaluate a 3D structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she uses something called
persistent homology, which takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: geodesic distance that you measure from
one end of a complicated structure to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the timing at which various components
fuse into one another or disappear can be
[SPEAKER_00]: mapped as a barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this animation illustrates as you go
from the tips down into the central trunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and down, the various components start to
disappear and get melded into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can be portrayed as a barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that allows you to do is take
many different complicated branching
[SPEAKER_00]: structures and mathematically distinguish
them using this barcode sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is Mao's expertise,
certainly not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am exceedingly fortunate to work with
such experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Margaret knows Mao very well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bell pepper that you had up there
before, assuming that the instrument and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is all set up, how long does it
take for the machine to do the scanning to
[SPEAKER_02]: generate the information, which then
ultimately leads to the video?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is specifically that
bell pepper scan, how long does it take to
[SPEAKER_00]: image?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that particular bell pepper,
it was about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively non-dense, relatively easy
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 30-minute scan typically has 3600,
4500 projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be lower resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go longer, higher resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a window within which we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for something low density like that,
a 30-minute scan covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jumping back into persistent homology,
it's a way to measure all these unique 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: scans of all these hundreds of rachises
that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I provided all the 3D data to Mao.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ran these 3D shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extracted surface volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She put the surface volumes through a
persistent homology measurement tool that
[SPEAKER_00]: she engineered and then used linear
discriminant analysis to group these
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent homology measurements based on
their characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what turned out was this LDA grouping
of all the phenotypes, all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D measurements of the great rachises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corresponded very nicely to the actual
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it mapped very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very broad range of shapes actually
linked very nicely to the differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mao was really the spearhead of the
analysis side of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I had the easy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept putting rachises in and
scanning them and getting these wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: data back from Mao showing what we were
learning from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing we wanted to learn
was, can we use this in a predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we scan actual grape bunches and start
to incorporate the size of the berry and
[SPEAKER_00]: the distribution of the berries along the
grape rachis to start to come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling rules for how does a bunch of
grapes form?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the rules that govern the shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it stop at a certain point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it stop when it contacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it stop at a certain weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the measurement data
that went into this paper that Mao,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jason was part of, I was a part of Dan
Chitwood, a number of folks who really
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to understanding more about
how these objects occupy 3D space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is just an animation
that Mao put together that illustrates
[SPEAKER_00]: using these rules how berries might grow
and how they form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it begins with mapping the rachis
itself and then adding the modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: component that we got from the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorghum panicles, sorghum is a very
important crop for food security in many
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows often in places where corn does
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the image here, you can see that it's
tremendous variability in panicle
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started at the Danforth,
there were a few scientists who had
[SPEAKER_00]: collections of hundreds and hundreds of
different panicles from an association of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mao.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we realized that an X-ray scan of
an entire panicle would give us a really
[SPEAKER_00]: data-rich information to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only could we see every individual
grain, but then we could also see the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying architecture of the panicle
itself, all the branches that hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're breeding sorghum and
you want more grains, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what the impact is on the
supporting architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're very fortunate to work
with very talented post-docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mao, again, was part of this, but Ray
Xiao, who's now a scientist at Wageningen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Netherlands, they took all the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scanned over 900 sorghum panicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were able to do was to use
the scan data to, as you can see from this
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, map where along the panicle the
most grains were deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it most in the middle, most at the
ends?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did that vary across the 900 in
the population?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom in and actually analyze the shape of
every individual grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How round were they, how spherical,
how ellipsoid, and how was that shape
[SPEAKER_00]: range distributed across the 900
varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then electronically remove every
single grain, not by hand, but
[SPEAKER_00]: electronically, and then leave behind the
branching architecture and map that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these are all mappable,
measurable 3D trait data, phenotype data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be compared using multivariate
statistics amongst all these 900 different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found, that the conventional
wisdom was the shape of the panicle
[SPEAKER_00]: dictated the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find the same examples of
panicle architecture across all the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was not the measure of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, working with all-stars like
Toby Kellogg in the field of grass and
[SPEAKER_00]: grass biology is just one of the benefits
of being at the Danforth, surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: just really phenomenal people that raise
your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far more important than that is a
distillery located in downtown St. Louis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where a friend of mine, Dave Weglertz,
makes a really spectacular sorghum
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever get to St. Louis,
you have to go to this distillery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just four blocks from Bush Stadium,
if you go to the ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd love to give you samples of the
sorghum whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see off to the side some of
the sorghum panicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always some practical input from the
imaging that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I told you the top lab started out
looking at corn roots and corn root
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does one actually measure and
phenotype maize roots, when obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: everything important is happening below
ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been breeding plants as humans
for thousands of years, but only breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can see and improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that came root traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've not been able to work with them
very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at these 15 different
maize root crowns, it's a very informative
[SPEAKER_00]: region, right where the roots come
together, the nexus, right at the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all grown in the greenhouse in
an artificial medium, in great big tree
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental conditions were as
identical as we can practically make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the huge variety evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, the genes are playing a big role
in making roots decide how to occupy 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get a handle on those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find a good strategy for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it begins with measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll plant breeding populations out in
our research fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole lab goes out there with
shovels and lots of coolers of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of bribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's literally shovel-o-mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shovel will dig up a useful volume right
around that root crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they all get brought back to the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have washing stations and dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us really a very rich data
source that describes 3D architecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the maize root crowns are
relatively well-lignified at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold their shape pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparisons between genotypes are
valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can do is a very rapid
three-minute scan, because we're not so
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in the internal details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gives us a great model of the 3D
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we get 3D trait information about
how roots occupy 3D space?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I get the easy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to scan stuff and then dump
terabytes of data on our poor
[SPEAKER_00]: computational scientists who have to pull
information back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they've been able to do is
generate a number of trait extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are computational pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one looks at overall,
how does that root crown occupy 3D space?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ni and Mao and Tim and Ray developed
this computational pipeline which in
[SPEAKER_00]: stages takes a 3D volume and then
binarizes it, skeletonizes it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then allows it to use the geometry
tools available in many software packages
[SPEAKER_00]: to map how this complicated structure
occupies 3D space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any difference we see there,
we can assume relatively equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start to have measurements that
differ across phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more measurement differences we have
in phenotypes, let's compare that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual DNA sequences where we can
obviously see differences, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know which are the important ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree can we use multivariate
statistics to map the measured phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: differences onto the observed sequence
differences and start to zoom in on
[SPEAKER_00]: potential genes that control root
architecture?
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with colleagues at Washington
University in the computer science
[SPEAKER_00]: program, Tao Zhu's lab, and this was Dan's
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used Dan's PhD work to develop Topo
root, which is a different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline that starts with the same data
but now starts to look at individual high
[SPEAKER_00]: fidelity root traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they branching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they branching?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have sort of different scales of
these pipelines to pull as much 3D trait
[SPEAKER_00]: information out the other end as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible to do live plant imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have the large industrial scale
instrument, and Alex actually got his
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate degree here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a PhD student in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a really interesting mutant that
is altered in its ability to make nodal
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to see where do nodal roots
form or don't form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't form, did they never even
start or did they start and abort?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's controlling?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the morphology of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually do in vivo x-ray
imaging because these are relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: non-dense tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a living core plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, we did this last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at that region right at the
soil line because Alex is interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: nodal root formation right in those first
few nodes, right under the soil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the first node above the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's live imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scan was just seven minutes long,
relatively low energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it gives us is such incredibly
rich detailed 3D information that Alex
[SPEAKER_00]: this week is looking at tip stacks that go
through all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he has high resolution data through
this entire complicated region,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will now be pretty straightforward
for him to evaluate how many and where
[SPEAKER_00]: nodal roots are or are not between the
wild type and the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of what we're doing
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were fortunate enough to put
together a book chapter specifically on
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping using this large format x-ray
tomography instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, we're a root lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know what's going on
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But short of our tornado, it's difficult
to just sort of peel back what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: to look directly at what's happening
without fundamentally changing exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is we want to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're devising systems to do in situ
imaging of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what one of those setups look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's foam core PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively non-dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the heavy stuff for construction,
but much more lighter weight for food and
[SPEAKER_00]: water transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a variety of diameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look through it, this is an
example of a live image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't live, but it's a single 2D shot
of a radiograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to see anything in
this kind of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take, again, thousands of images
through the entire volume and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: computer reconstruction to rebuild the
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fly through looking from top
to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our eyes, it's relatively easy to
spot the roots, certainly the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and the secondaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to find the laterals,
it starts to get more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always going to be the problem
is resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to that shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this allows us to do,
if I can see the roots, then there is
[SPEAKER_00]: software out there that allows me to
iteratively teach a computer how to find
[SPEAKER_00]: and identify the roots, how to identify
the soil, how to identify the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to identify the sides of the pot,
because I want everything removed except
[SPEAKER_00]: to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we can do that, now we have
effectively a root crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have existing pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put that root crown in situ scan
through that pipeline and start to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: out 3D root traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the biggest hurdle that anyone
in tomography has is segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you teach a computer to only
measure what you want to see and discount
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this particular segmentation,
but utterly impractically, it took me
[SPEAKER_00]: about three weeks for one volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is the scan size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 45 gigabytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need all that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more information, the better you can
train the model, but the slower it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you downsize, you now lose the
resolution that you need to train a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a horrible trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the most frequently asked
questions I ever get is, what resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: can be achieved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on the left, on one side is a big
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is an acorn, much,
much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer, of course, is it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger your sample, the lower the
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true for all imaging and
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, if we're talking about
in situ root imaging, the bigger the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more dense the material, the lower the
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So effectively, what we're going to do is
choose different pots based on the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just want to see where primary roots
go, we'll use a big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll never see laterals.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see laterals, we have to use a much
smaller diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is as unusual as possible because
the roots immediately hit the sides and
[SPEAKER_00]: they bundle up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to take a variety pack way
of approaching different questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So resolution varies inversely with pot
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scan time increases with higher
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can increase the number
of projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get better resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get gigantic file sizes,
at least 40 gigabytes per volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a lot of heavy lifting in
addition to the massive problem that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with data management, data storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got hundreds of terabytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think we're over a petabyte
now just with the x-ray stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you grow the plants in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you want to use field soil,
but that's really dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more dense something is,
the lower the resolution because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to blast more x-ray energy to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use various artificial media,
which are less dense, but sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: departing from a natural field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, lots and lots of trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resolution versus size versus time versus
the growth medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we want to get as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this lovely Kieselbach volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hand-drawn images are just
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're getting a tiny glimpse,
whether it's excavated root crowns or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little in-situ pot that we grow for two or
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a proxy for what's actually
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always dealing with trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So root imaging, we can get lots of useful
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we keep sneaking up on what's actually
happening in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll never get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never a physical system where
you're going to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: field-sized plants inside the cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cabinet of an x-ray chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find as many proxies as
possible to inform what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The large-format instrument does hit a
resolution limit when you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very fine details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is exemplified by this soybean
axillary bud system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the live images on the phone image is
on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of a dime,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very intricate structure,
lots of different small things going on
[SPEAKER_00]: all in one small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no microscope that will show you
what that looks like in 3D if it's intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light microscope, you'll have to slice
it, squash it, make it small, electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy, embed it in resin,
and cut the little tiny blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never get that intact structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the x-ray microscope
absolutely shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the inside of the system
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Valent and their parent company,
Sumitomo Chemical, were very interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, root-soil-microbe
interactions, as well as carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been generous supporters of the
lab, in addition to the Danforth Center
[SPEAKER_00]: itself funding a third of this instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you can see by the labels
that there are actually objective lenses
[SPEAKER_00]: that you swing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there are actually
objective lenses that you swing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: beam path in order to magnify some of the
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to compare how
conventional x-ray tomography generates an
[SPEAKER_00]: image with the x-ray microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recall that conventional is just basic
geometry of source, sample, detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And varying those distances changes your
magnification and your resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The x-ray microscope, you still also have
an x-ray source, which projects x-rays
[SPEAKER_00]: through a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that does is the x-rays strike a
scintillator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scintillator converts x-rays into
light, and that's mounted on the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: an objective lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you get the scintillator
x-ray to light, mounted on the lens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how you generate the 3D image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, unfortunately for the lab-based
systems, a relatively inefficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scan times take much, much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, always trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're able to get out the other
end is, I never get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day I come in, I get to see
something that no one on the planet has
[SPEAKER_00]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, it's just stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this soybean axial bud,
typically it's fixed and contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not typically live imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a large format instrument,
this is about as good as you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at it with the x-ray microscope,
you just get a different universe of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen beautiful paintings and drawings
of plant anatomy throughout my entire
[SPEAKER_00]: career, but it was not until I sat down at
the workstation and saw my first soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: floret scan when I actually appreciated
how the anthers are distributed in 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: space right around the stigmatic surface
and how sensible that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never get that in 3D, but here you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing ovules there, pollen-packed
anthers distributed right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fixed and contrast enhanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way you can do developmental
studies is if you fix them over
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time and relative dimension in space,
for any Doctor Who fans, TARDIS,
[SPEAKER_00]: is part of what we have to do to try to
get developmental series using this
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Margaret earlier about
how striking some of the 3D volumes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very impactful, but not
necessarily scientifically useful other
[SPEAKER_00]: than putting zooms in context of the whole
organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what those 3D volumes represent is
what we call a fly through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at an arbitrary dimension,
slice by slice, and seeing every single
[SPEAKER_00]: angle through this very complicated
structure in very high resolution rich
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do cell level resolution in a 3D
space using this kind of imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it has to be fixed and contrast
enhanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the side, there are some pretty
typical contrast agents which,
[SPEAKER_00]: with my background in electron microscopy,
are routinely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphatungstic acid, iodine, osmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janek Stadler's lab in 2013 was the first
one to publish any kind of survey using a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab-based x-ray microscope, and they
looked at a few different plant samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that as a jumping off point to
really expand what they first introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: and really explore a wider range of plant
samples and improved instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Janek's lab was the one who started it,
and we sort of benefited from their
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneering work to really branch out into
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling Lynn earlier that I went to
a botanical microscopy conference where
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody there was a plant scientist and
an imaging specialist, so a pretty rare
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd seen the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we recognize each other on the
plane over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the John Innis Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They read the paper, but they still didn't
get it until I actually stood in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: them like this and showed them the
animations and showed them how a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: gets presented to the instrument before
they could realize what was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to really spend some time
showing you how these samples are prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they're presented to the
instrument so you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous value of the imaging data that
comes out the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around the Danforth Center,
we do not have a corporate lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an authentic Missouri prairie,
which is fantastic, although the neighbors
[SPEAKER_00]: complained that when are you going to cut
your lawn?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's beautiful, wildflowers,
and it's much more mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have asclepias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have milkweed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great example to illustrate
the step-by-step process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at something,
again, this is about the size of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd cover that with a nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large, complicated flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes into, in this case, an ethanolic
solution of phosphatungstic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethanol gets past all the
hydrophobicity of a plant sample and
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates very, very well, although it
takes weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is minimum of about 21 days for the
phosphatungstic acid to penetrate and to
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you present this really
delicate, flimsy tissue paper-like thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to a microscope for 12 hours and not have
it move around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Low melting point agarose.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all of our labs, we have plastic tubes
of a wide range of sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pick the tube that fits it best,
fill it with molten agarose, drop in your
[SPEAKER_00]: sample after a quick rinse, and it holds
that delicate, complicated structure in
[SPEAKER_00]: place for a long imaging scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're able to do is generate,
again, very, very rich 3D volumes where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do multi-scale imaging without
leaving the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low-magnification scan of the whole
thing, identify a region of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then zoom in for a high-resolution
scan, never having touched the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it in the instrument and let
the computer do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the 3D volume rendering has a great
impact for getting people to remember what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to do to illustrate the
multi-scale imaging, putting a high-mag
[SPEAKER_00]: region of interest within the context of
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much more impactful is the
fly-through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that cell-level resolution of the
entire structure, but totally shocking to
[SPEAKER_00]: me the beautiful symmetry of the sample
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking, I get mesmerized watching
this movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes me think of spirographs
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the volumes I'm going to show
you will have the 3D volume rendering
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by the fly-through to impress
upon you how data-rich these volumes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a paper we published in 22
looking at nodule formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are soybean nodules formed by
Bradyrhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the multi-scale nature,
we can zoom in on individual bacteroids
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put that zoom scan within the
context of the whole nodule, where all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteroids and the vasculature are really,
really easy to visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with a competent computational
scientist, you can identify all these
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're computationally identified,
you can measure them and start to then
[SPEAKER_00]: compare these measurements between
nodules, between time points, between
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have measurements to go along with
these phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gus did a great job segmenting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ranges of studies we
look at, again, the Danforth Center is
[SPEAKER_00]: very well-positioned to look at food
security crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And teff is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very popular in Eastern Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great salt tolerance, great for drought,
lousy agronomic traits, a very willowy
[SPEAKER_00]: stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shattering is very, very bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds quite understandably want to
disperse as easily as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's lousy if you want to actually
collect the seeds for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shattering is a trait we wanted to get
rid of so the seed would stay put so the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers could harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shattering is a trait that we studied
here, again, in 3D.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ways with intact samples that you can't
do just by embedding and sectioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucia was a postdoc in Malia Gan's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now across the street at Beyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a great job there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she developed some mutants in quinoa
that showed some very good heat tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the inflorescence structures and
the pollination timing, which is often
[SPEAKER_00]: most negatively affected by heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to be able to do is first
map out in 3D what does normal look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the normal complicated inflorescence
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you blast it with heat,
how does that change the structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have a heat tolerant
mutant, how does it survive that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All to inform what heat tolerance genes
can we get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we improve all these different
plant varieties by identifying the genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are most important?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the 2D fly throughs just
provide so much rich detailed information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can answer questions using these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't even ask before doing this
kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will Viana has got some great setaria
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works in Jose Danini's lab at Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have some mutants that are
altered in their ability to make root
[SPEAKER_00]: primordia in setaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're able to do is scan the
entire nodal plexus, that really important
[SPEAKER_00]: junction at the soil line where all the
vasculature is coming together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and look for the origin or not of root
primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a 3D volume is great for context,
but the power comes from the 2D slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're going to be able to do is
segment every single cell, measure and map
[SPEAKER_00]: every single cell in the wild type and the
mutant and compare all those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a priceless way to get at
phenotypic information where you can link
[SPEAKER_00]: to sequence variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top lab is getting into more cover
crop biology because of its potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: aiding soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, cover crops make beautiful
nodules, great for nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree can we use multiscale x-ray
microscopy imaging to inform nodule
[SPEAKER_00]: development?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, situating the high magnification
scan within the full 3D volume is cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the data, the real information comes
from these 2D slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to get away without
showing something Arabidopsis related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are developing Arabidopsis seeds
inside of Salik.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just to illustrate the unique data
that is available using this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Margaret.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of her samples that she left
with me before she left the Danforth
[SPEAKER_00]: Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two week old tomato seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fly through, but again,
what it's telling you is if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in graft biology and graft,
whether it will take or not, graft
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility, this will give you a
roadmap of the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a competent computational
scientist to map all the vasculature,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is something you have available
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceteria, shoot apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, now just examples, all the
different kinds of biological tissue in 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young Arabidopsis seedlings, you want to
do phenotypic, phenotyping of an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing Ceteria panicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that used to be 3D with,
or used to be with scanning electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy where you just get a 2D
photograph of a really cool 3D structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have a full 3D map inside,
outside, upside and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any angle you want to go through,
you have the 3D information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, important to sort of remind you and
point out the different ways in which
[SPEAKER_00]: samples are presented to the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to understand what the geometry
is to see how will it or perhaps won't it
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to the kinds of questions I want to
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't put an ear of corn in there
as such, but certainly a kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the capacity for large things
and I'll show you that later, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a range of things that we can put in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a soybean root nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's suspended in agarose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at Pennycress is a very popular
cover crop these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on with a company called
Covercress at the Danforth Center to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennycress to take advantage of the
agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are dry seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just sort of wedged in the end of
a pipette tip with poster putty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of creative ways just to present
your samples to the x-ray beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, resin embedded plant tissue
is going to be a mainstay of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly for volume EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a flat panel in the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do in vivo root imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we grow plants in these PVC
pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flat panel will allow us to map the
entire root structure at high resolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, 26 micrometer voxel
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely get laterals with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you find a region of interest,
swap in one of the objective lenses and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at high resolution, high mag at a
region of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to use this system now to
adapt to looking at mycorrhizal fungi in
[SPEAKER_00]: these larger systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show some of the earlier work we
did with that shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm often asked about phase contrast
imaging, certainly from the synchrotron
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, because phase can be very powerful
at a synchrotron when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: samples of low density and low
differential density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the capacity to do phase
contrast imaging in our system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we take a big hit on resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zeiss does develop some AI tools to
help sort of clean up the noise that is
[SPEAKER_00]: expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, this was a sample, this was a
soybean flour that was only fixed in
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol that immediately imaged,
no contrast agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to do imaging,
but clearly you take a big hit in what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see relative to contrast enhanced
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my goal is to get more people to
think about and to take advantage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a white paper that's
free to download.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to the Zeiss website and
download this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells a lot of the nuts and bolts of
the methods and the sample development for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing x-ray microscopy specifically for
plant samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many plant scientists have access
to core facilities, but don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: present the sample to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Core facilities have x-ray microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never worked with plant samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that the publications that we
have will bring a lot of that together and
[SPEAKER_00]: really expand what everyone is in a
position to do with x-ray imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little over a year ago, Nature came out
with technologies to watch in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And volume EM, volume electron microscopy,
is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is using various electron
microscopes where one can do physical
[SPEAKER_00]: sectioning in order to generate a 3D
volume at the nanometer scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's serial block face scanning
electron microscopes where you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual physical microtome inside the
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll take a diamond knife,
you'll cut one section image, cut image
[SPEAKER_00]: and get maybe hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get down to about 50,
60 nanometer in section thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other alternative is a plasma focused
ion beam where you can actually use a
[SPEAKER_00]: laser to ablate the surface image,
ablate image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get down to about 5 or 10
nanometer section thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can generate a beautiful 3D volume
at the organ cellar scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so volume EM is something we want to
use as a roadmap to drive volume EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that looks like, here's a sample
of actually a tobacco leaf disc embedded
[SPEAKER_00]: in resin, mounted in the x-ray microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do a scan of the entire leaf
disc to get a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you bring in some of the world's
leading plant tissue specific imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kirk Zemeck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a postdoc in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at DuPont.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now the director of the imaging
facility at the Danforth Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's never just the instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some of the most talented
microscopists in the world working with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best instruments on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring expertise and instrumentation
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can do is astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nastya Janithri and Lolita are just
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to do some marvelous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fly through of the low
magnification x-ray scan through the
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco leaf disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Kirk and his team did was take my
3D scan and identify in green this region
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we worked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the sample back and then did a much
higher magnification scan of that region
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the data, hand it back over to them,
and they use it as a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to look at just these
mesophyll sections of mesophyll cells
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated by the yellow box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that went actually to the SEM,
which had a backscatter electron detector,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can actually use to invert the
black and white, and it looks like a TEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That region of interest, and then using
their technology, they zoom in on features
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want to look at, like the purple
box there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with serial block face imaging,
they went zooming through this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they collected about 250 or
300 sections, each as it indicates,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 nanometers thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you have a 3D volume at very,
very high nanometer scale resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, computational science is
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good computational scientist now can
identify and measure individual features
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can see and measure
distribution in 3D space, total volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, different changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is now measurable and
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the publication is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please look into it as something
that you might want to take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised some specific work on what
we're doing with mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you, I'm sure, understand that
mycorrhizal fungi form beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with most plant roots in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exchange nutrients and water with the
plant for photosynthetic sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial relationship for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an imaging standpoint, we're
interested in the purple bits,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the fungal structures that are out
in the soil that colonize the root and
[SPEAKER_00]: then start this nutrient exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been some genuinely spectacular
signed paper research looking at the genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that play roles in governing these
relationships, the exchange of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's benefiting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's cheating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's holding up their end of the bargain?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really fantastic work that's
been done all in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some great imaging work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen Magali, she's finishing her PhD at
Cambridge, and she designed this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope slide where the plant grows on
the edge and you can train a single root
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out between two glass slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do great imaging work and in real
time do dynamic imaging work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fluorescent tools available,
but it's always in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a difficult system to look at to
understand how these things are naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed in as natural a system as you
can engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hyphae are transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're difficult to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a pack of hyphae just stuck in
agarose at the bottom of a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make these transparent
structures contrasty enough to see with
[SPEAKER_00]: the electron microscope, with the X-ray
microscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look back at our experience with using
electron microscopy and making things
[SPEAKER_00]: contrasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmium is clearly something that,
although challenging to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very, very effective at making
transparent things contrasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our in vitro carrot root culture,
we were able to very clearly show that the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal structures both inside and outside
the roots were very well contrasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied that to what we're calling a
microcosm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow alfalfa or brachypodium in
small 20 mil syringe barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots will be colonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal structures will grow out into the
surrounding medium, and we can contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: them and image them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing here in orange is
fungal spores and vesicles both inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the root in the surrounding growth
medium, as well as intra-radical hyphae
[SPEAKER_00]: and extra-radical hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've demonstrated this can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to speed up a little bit just to
make sure we get through in time for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, at the Danforth Center,
we're surrounded by some fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, and Armando's got great
experience in mycorrhizal biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's developed the brachypodium system
along with his senior tech, Mallette.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using that to look at colonization,
again, in these microcosms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better the imaging, the more
successful we can actually train a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer model to identify the features we
want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in yellow here is both internal
spores as well as vesicles inside a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can quantify the amount of fungus
that's inside a colonized root in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this opens up some really huge avenues
to start exploring basic biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree can we quantify fungal
biomass in a given genotypic interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: particular maize genotype, particular
brachypodium genotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that normal change with less
phosphorus, more phosphorus, more
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we change the environment and
alter these measurable traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also exploring other things in
addition to osmium to see can we get away
[SPEAKER_00]: from a volatile toxic heavy metal as
something to visualize fungal structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at nanogold conjugates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always conjugate things to fungal
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we stick enough gold particles on it
to be able to see with the x-ray
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we're prepping a methods
manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up with a switch from
the plant, the roots, and the fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the medium within which they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the two instruments, we can do a lot
of multi-scale imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use the x-ray microscope to look at
the microbial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at soil aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was telling Lynn, we're
constantly learning new techniques and new
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to learn soil physics over the
past couple years in soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that the aggregate is
essentially the lowest, the smallest
[SPEAKER_00]: currency of agricultural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took a shovel and scoop big
agricultural soil and just shook it
[SPEAKER_00]: around, the smallest naturally occurring
size of chunk that comes out is a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size and the stability of that
aggregate tells you a lot about the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at the actual structure of
soil aggregate with the x-ray microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can look at a soil core from the
same area, put the context of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate into the core, and then the core
into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across scales, we can study a lot about
the structure of actual agricultural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some great collaborators at
K-State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck Rice's lab has been around for
decades, and Carlos was spearheading this
[SPEAKER_00]: work as a PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Cody, Mao, Sarah, and Clara are the
Danforth scientists who are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're comparing it to what would be a gold
standard, the Konza prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 3,500 hectares of undisturbed
tall grass prairie in Eastern Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to ask is, what can we learn
about the 3D structure of soil across
[SPEAKER_00]: scales?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck's lab has been monitoring and
managing some research fields for now over
[SPEAKER_00]: 34 consecutive years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been using no-till compared to
conventional tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been using conventional chemical
fertilizer compared to using a high
[SPEAKER_00]: organic manure as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collected soil cores and soil
aggregates and sent them to us for imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: from all these different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a typical soil core inside the
large format x-ray instrument and a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical image of what you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sub-sampled the middle to avoid some of
the cracking artifacts in the side because
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to measure pore space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cracks are obviously going to bias
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing, and this is work in
progress, we're using these very high
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution 3D scans of a core to map out
pore space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we differentiate between pore space
and soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was always shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to soil science meetings where
everyone's saying, here's all the pore
[SPEAKER_00]: space and here's all the soil organic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never seen the x-ray scans where
the overlap is way too much to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're losing a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've turned Mao Li loose on this problem,
so if anyone can solve it, she can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to map out what are the
differences that we can observe
[SPEAKER_00]: structurally between the different field
management practices, and then drop down
[SPEAKER_00]: to a smaller scale, look at an entire soil
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, map out the pore space,
map out the organic material, and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that over scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree does the pore space map in
the aggregate compare or not to the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent treatment, but at a larger
scale in a soil core?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one predictive of the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn across scales?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've embedded some of the aggregates in
resin, and we've sent some samples off
[SPEAKER_00]: from x-ray fluorescence, and ideally maybe
work with a synchrotron to do some zanes
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at very subtle differences and
elemental mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also we could use these for
volume electron microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's what some of this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to compare soil pore networks
across these treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an Elementar mass spec system in
the lab so we can look at and measure
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute amount of carbon, absolute amount
of nitrogen, and Cody's really the one
[SPEAKER_00]: heading up this manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lin knows I could talk for hours,
but I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will spare you, and I will stop here and
happily take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're checking the chat to see if there
are questions from online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we'll look here in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can we get to the
cellular level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the samples have to be smaller,
but for example, this Ceteria nodal
[SPEAKER_00]: plexus, that sample was maybe three
millimeters tall by a millimeter in
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter, easily achieving cellular
resolution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the soybean developing flowers,
you can see the entire structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we could zoom in onto the
developing ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see polar nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to see at the cellular
level in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these cells in the plants are
actually quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the stock segments,
a lot of the grafting stuff, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence development.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of complicated material
there, but it's relatively large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can achieve cellular level
resolution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root nodules were another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, keep in mind that
this is just a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most powerful lens we have is just
40x.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even your tabletop microscope,
you multiply that by 10 times from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocular lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a 40x lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will never see a bacterial cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see a bacteroid, which is
essentially a plant host cell that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of taken over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not see a bacterial cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see AMF spores if they're
contrasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to differentiate the hyphae
if they're there, unless they've got a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of osmium on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the fade-out range.
[SPEAKER_04]: How rapidly can you screen the little
tubes with the brachyphonium and the
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal fungi that were in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that take a long time to do that
scan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is about the
microcosms looking at brachyphonium and
[SPEAKER_00]: also alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly can we scan those?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll end up doing is I can do a
relatively short scan, which is three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours, but that shows me the entire
microcosm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low resolution, but enough for me to see
the bright spots of fungal material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll set up a hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a higher magnification scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be 10 to 12 hours at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those scans are quite long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for high throughput or even
medium throughput, but it is genuinely
[SPEAKER_00]: unique in being able to see the
distribution of mycorrhizal structures in
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D in an undisturbed in situ rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the field, but no one else is in
a position to do this kind of 3D in situ
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you flooding that whole syringe
with osmium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and we're also taking advantage of
the fact that osmium has a great vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use osmium vapors to also
contrast material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other benefit of that syringe
barrel system is it's got a lure lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can lock that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can parafilm the crap out of these
things and make sure that it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very well contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am doing right now is I've got some
microcosms that I flooded with ethanolic
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphatungstic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vitro, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see individual arbuscules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic, but it takes weeks and
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've set these up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a meniscus on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is absolutely flooded in
ethanolic phosphatungstic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at it in a couple of
months from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I can get away from osmium,
I definitely want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But short of not being able to image at
all, the other step is going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned, using gold conjugates,
so nanogold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lectins are very good in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good at sticking to mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in vitro, we've shown that we can
stick enough wheat germagglutinin
[SPEAKER_00]: conjugated to gold nanoparticles so that
we can see in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going to be enough to
see in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bigger system and much more
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you said there are resolution
image issues with the large scale x-ray
[SPEAKER_00]: tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the cutoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this extend to fine roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can engineer the pot to be able to
see the biology of interest that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to see lateral roots,
we'll grow something in nothing bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than, say, four or five centimeter
diameter pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might just even get away from using
field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use ground up clay like profile or
turfus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are commercially available
artificial growth media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be able to see lateral roots in
that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at a larger pot, we will never
see lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can adjust pot size and growth
medium to allow the instrument to show us
[SPEAKER_00]: what's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an overlap between the large
format instrument and the x-ray
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have a flat panel option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you saw one of the images in here where
I had a small corn plant in the x-ray
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That panel is higher resolution than the
one in the large format instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in that same three centimeter
diameter PVC pipe, we'll get better
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution in the x-ray microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a longer scan, and it's 60 to 70
gigabytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, always the trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see small roots in a big
thing, it's going to cost you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Margaret?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking about your last part
on field soil composition and your early
[SPEAKER_03]: work on root architecture and the
plasticity of roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you thinking about a system where you
can start looking at how the heterogeneity
[SPEAKER_03]: of real soil systems is influencing that
plasticity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to get the chance to say that
we're working on a topsoil in Chris Top's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on an authentic field soil
that is reproducible that we can use all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because up till now, we've only used the
artificial media because that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: less daunting for segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field soil is so much more like a root
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more difficult to teach the
computer to find the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is our goal this year especially,
is to demonstrate that in a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: diameters, we can grow two different maze
genotypes where we know the root structure
[SPEAKER_00]: is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root architecture is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get good enough at segmentation
where we can pull out those 3D volumes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're root 3D volumes with nothing
around them and plug them into our trade
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually see that the trade
differences we can see by eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can also measure from the in situ x-ray
scans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to demonstrate that we can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can then step forward through
all the different basic biology questions
[SPEAKER_00]: from genotype to environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any work being done to build
functional plant models, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: using especially the architecture data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are computational scientists and
modeling scientists who are taking some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these data and developing it into
different questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are collaborators we have at St.
Louis University as well as Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: University, both in downtown St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are in computer science programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often, they are starved for data
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got hundreds of terabytes of data
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do as much as you can with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tao Zhu's lab really developed,
and this was, again, Dan Zhang did a great
[SPEAKER_00]: job, developing a skeletonization protocol
that sort of got around the problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: loops, where things would loop back
against one another and the computer would
[SPEAKER_00]: lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been able to convert that
2D into 3D, where you could actually track
[SPEAKER_00]: these looping structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, a lot of that work is being
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got great colleagues who are
following that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
