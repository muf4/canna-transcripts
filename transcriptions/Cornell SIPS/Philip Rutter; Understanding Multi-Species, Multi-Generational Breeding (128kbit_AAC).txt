[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, Phillip A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell was part of my intellectual
heritage, although I didn't graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my most important mentors was
the man who co-founded the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Chestnut Foundation with me, Dr. Charles
Russell Burnham.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his PhD here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his office was shared with Barbara
McClintock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was another founder of Cytogenetics,
and he was also Norman Borlaug's first
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Norm started his class, he was a
forestry major.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he finished Burnham's class,
he was a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was basically his last student,
unofficially, but very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the problem right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that when I come back east,
an awful lot of people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the entire state of Iowa
looks like, except there are three trees
[SPEAKER_00]: along a creek somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, most of Indiana, half of
Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing alive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is corn desert, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are used to thinking of this as good,
rich, productive, farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blink and dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months out of the year, nothing lives
here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a catastrophe, as we are
rapidly coming to realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, of course, is too many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got to Badger Set Farm,
I bailed out of the PhD program with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything but the degree there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having discovered I didn't really want
to be a professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moved to a farm in southeast Minnesota,
which is the richest farm country on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look it up in the geology books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Tamaphayette soils, silt loams,
just incredibly productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's on very rolling hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glaciers missed us, and it erodes if
you spit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will all disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hill in the back of my greenhouse,
according to the 1955 U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAA survey said there was between 18 and
12 inches of black topsoil on that hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got there in 1976, there was
between zero and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: One foot of black topsoil has disappeared
in that amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still eroding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the black is gone, then it's brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, well, brown is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there used to be black topsoil here,
and it's already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this over and over with row
crop agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all this training, and I've been
extremely lucky in my education in the
[SPEAKER_00]: zoology department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the last remaining
interdisciplinary horizontal departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This office has an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is an ornithologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is an embryologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is a parasitologist,
who in fact was my advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on down the hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all interested in evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the topic constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fabulous education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting on the world's best soil,
which is disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of feel responsible to look
around and see what might be done that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could we grow here instead that would
make food for humans at the same scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: but would not destroy the land?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a long search of multiple years
to try to figure out what is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of the keys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the energy is a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gentleman, Don Lawrence, was a friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to measure primary productivity
is a huge can of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all incredibly incomparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody uses the same method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody measures the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't actually compare anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a measure that Don Lawrence and
his student came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pounds of chlorophyll per acre
over the entire year, as theoretically an
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator to how much sunlight is being
captured there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put them all together,
Savannah is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prairie is by far the worst maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oak woods, hardwood forest, has enormously
more chlorophyll per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's catching more sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more energy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides energy, if you have a woody plant,
you don't have to stick a plow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Droughts that kill my neighbor's corn and
beans don't touch the trees, any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen hazels be underwater three feet
deep for four months and still bear nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: and survive the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the part that's out of the water,
they'll survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are dramatically more resilient
than the annual crops that we're used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: being incredibly careful about all year
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this idea that the reason we grow
beans and corn is because these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: most productive things we can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just flat not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most productive crop in the world is
oil palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a species hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 10 times more productive of
oil than soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not even counting the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more productive in protein,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't bother to capture it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oil palm is an enormous ecological
obscenity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might just as well bring the baby right
back and spread them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are looking at soybean production,
food, oil, protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the bushes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is soybean scale food production
without a plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really very close to the
theoretical maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the beginning of the process
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, you will almost certainly
never see a wild hazel that's got nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crammed on it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity in the nuts is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every different shaped nut you see is a
different type of genetics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also grow species hybrid chestnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five species in my chestnut
breeding for reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hybrid pecan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit calling them hybrid hickory pecans
because nobody had any clue what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mixes between pecan and shag bark
hickory and pecan and bitter nut hickory,
[SPEAKER_00]: then interpolated in the next generation
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extremely much more interesting
than I thought when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always thought I have a soft spot
in my head for hickories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try doing it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're working out really extremely
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very early there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to explain this to academics
about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, okay, what I'm doing is hybrid
swarm breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ask an audience like this of
professional biologists, have you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of a hybrid swarm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have one hand go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's changed mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put you to it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet half your hands would go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it was partly due to DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now discovering that hybrid swarms
are everywhere in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species cross and generate new species
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark my words, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 20 years, in your genetics book,
it will say hybrid swarm processes are the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one source of new species all
around the world, over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how speciation happens a lot of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know this when I started 30
and 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat was not known to be a mixture of
species, but it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potatoes, most of this stuff is now due to
the fact that we've got DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bananas, all the feziolus beans are
supposed to be the result of one
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization in the lowlands a couple
thousand years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breadfruit is a spectacular story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The native peoples there, breadfruit
enabled them to get out into Micronesia
[SPEAKER_00]: and Polynesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't do it until they had the
right hybrid that would grow on the
[SPEAKER_00]: brackish atoll, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made the hybrids on purpose,
knowing exactly what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot more of what we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to call these things,
at this point, neo-hybrids, because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried for years talking to farmers and
said, well, it's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't win that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either think you're talking about
hybrid corn, which has absolutely nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the genetics that's going on
here, or they think you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid horse and donkey, like a mule,
which is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't talk them out of that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give it a different name and say,
OK, we're talking about something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hazel group that I'm working with
primarily consists of Americana,
[SPEAKER_00]: Avalana, and corn neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others there are possible to add to it
if there is reason to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I don't know of any reason
to attempt to add any of those other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just found a reason to go back to
Avalana and add something there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is big bud mite, which is a European
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets into both the native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got some Hungarian Avalana on my
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have bud mite surrounded by
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So natural hybrid swarms, which is what my
model started with, this is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a Venn diagram of a continental
wide species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variation from one side of the
continent to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different ecotypes, all kinds of
variation from one side to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then geology happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain range comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the populations are separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't see each other anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason why most sympatric
species have crossing barriers you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really obvious reason for
hazels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is American hazel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the typical husk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemicals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells of terpenes frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer would rather not eat the thing most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically chemical pest
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beaked hazel, which is the beaked
group has been separated from the American
[SPEAKER_00]: group for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't use chemical warfare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has cactus spines all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a physical defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you cross them, you easily wind
up with nuts that are absolutely defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have neither the spines nor the
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why crossing barriers are a
good idea if you've got two different
[SPEAKER_00]: people living side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, what are we doing?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big jump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the mountain range wears down,
when the continents bump into each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: species run into each other, hybridize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new species come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spectacular example in animals just
in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European bison called a wisent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaeologists were trying to figure out
where the heck it came from because they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't finding a lot of bones around
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were digging, digging,
got some DNA and discovered that wisents,
[SPEAKER_00]: European bison, which looks just like a
bison, it's a perfectly good species,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a species hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross between the step bison,
which has been extinct for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and Aurochs, the original cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10% of the wisent DNA is still,
is Aurochs DNA right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two species really quite different,
hybridized, and the survivor, both of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parent species are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survivor was the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, okay, doing the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a little sideways thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing with tossing several
species into the bowl and mixing them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like a really bad idea to most
horticulturists.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you ever going to get anything
useful back out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is enormous truth in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, you know, to go out and look
at the hillside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably we can figure out how to do it
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking for a domestic woody
plant, and I mean domesticated on the
[SPEAKER_00]: order of maize, which is, you know,
it cannot survive without humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't, it won't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples survive, grapes survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as domesticated as they might
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a real domesticated partner to
generate it out of mixed species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have various characteristics that we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to actually dig into what the
heck is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, we know things about the corn
genome at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not expecting you to read and
understand all of this, believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't unless I sit down with my slide
gruel, as they say, and work my way
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These slides were put together by my son,
who's a PhD mechanical engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does the math, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conversation is a little bit dense
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can, you know, you can go to the
literature and look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many genes does corn have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many alleles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the structure of the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything knows, certainly not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice, 96% of the rice genes are the same
as corn, which is surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 75% are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly large number, but they're
probably, you know, 70% of the same genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with what we know,
and with how genes work, that we made very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, very conservative assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 1% of the genes have allelic
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very low number, probably way too
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among the genes that have been
examined, there tends to be about four
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles per locus, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just need to work your way through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this about poplar, 41,000 loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazels have about the same amount of DNA
as rice, which doesn't mean much of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're guessing in the middle there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aware of the fact that there's been
more hazel genome analysis in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years, and I haven't tracked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do the numbers in one species of
the hazel, there's about 10 to the 30th
[SPEAKER_00]: more genetic, basic genetic diversity in
this woody species than there is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems totally insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to do the math, however.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why this should be so is
that woody plants have to find an answer
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next environmental problem
internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual plants have a generation every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a new situation come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reproduce, the survivors reproduce,
and you solve it by reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woody plants cannot reproduce that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you've got a disease that
knocks out 95% of the oak trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may be reproductively isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those surviving trees may have no partner
that they can reach through pollination to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive sexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the trees do is they carry immense
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they hope that some of it will be
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put two species together,
it jumps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to 10 to the 428th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a frightening number, and it gets
scarier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, when you put three species,
about 10 to the 450th, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: astronomical number, it's one of those
numbers that's impossible to actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: your human brain around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic diversity is the wealth of the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you can manage it, cope with
it, and sort through it, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity you have to work with,
the better you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix the species, it's
dramatically more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we did the math to this extent,
I knew the basics here, and I had been
[SPEAKER_00]: telling people for years, with our
population of 30-some thousand hazels,
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid hazels that Badger set at any one
time, we've planted many more than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then discarded some, there's more
genetic diversity in the hazels on that
[SPEAKER_00]: farm than exists in the entire world corn
genome, by a long, long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the wealth you can sort through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so sorting, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where almost everybody goes wrong
with trying to find a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find a good plant, so you grow
5,000 hybrid whatevers, and you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: through them for the perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you will never find the perfect
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you're looking for multiple
characteristics, you can plant the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the earth in hazel,
six feet apart, no rows, and you will find
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant that has the characteristics
that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't advise that you try this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only looking for two
characteristics, say there are three genes
[SPEAKER_00]: for each one, a couple of alleles,
do the math, if you're just looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: two characteristics in a cycle,
I don't even call it generations because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more complicated than that,
you can plant about 5,000 and you expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to find eight that have the whole
assemblage that you're actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you find about 50 that are almost
there, and you'll find about 20 that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something you had no idea they could
do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually quite rewarding,
but you have to plant 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant 10 in your backyard,
you're not ever going to find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to plant the numbers,
and you've got to be tough about sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: to the two characters at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add three traits, you're looking
at, again, astronomically difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the hazels at Badger Set,
cycle one, which was done quite some time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, was to select for cold hardiness,
because Avalon is not cold hardy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota, and for resistance to EFB
because eastern filbert blight kills
[SPEAKER_00]: European hazels dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those characteristics are now fixed in my
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even take data on cold hardiness
or EFB anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it was because I discovered in the
meantime that EFB is not actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commensal of the North American
species that just happens to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: European.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't worry about it very much,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not quite the same thing as
fighting a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle two was for heavy crop and annual
crop, which are not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find your selections, expand from
that population, plant another 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first cycle characteristics are
almost fixed there, but you keep selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: for that to the extent that oddballs show
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third cycle, we'll see some of them
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is second cycle selection material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got that thing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lateral twigs, there's about eight
nuts in that cluster, and there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on that twig.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things have more nuts than they do
leaves, and they can sustain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the involucer where the husk is
photosynthetic on its own, for one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's an astonishing amount of fruit
that they are capable of producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you ask them nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data is very, very strenuously,
meticulously kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the summary for the main plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those lines represents a
separate database entry for the year for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that matter,
crop weight, and these are grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out one and a half kilos,
less than one, two, one and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: one and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this is whether some of it is
fertilizer, lack of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered fairly early on that if you
fertilize this year, you can measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects three years down the road,
all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't ever fertilize them,
and you let them produce like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course they will run out of food,
and they will quit bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what was really going on
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the places where other
breeders have gotten stuck, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to work with multiple species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only become obvious to me,
as I've gotten deeper and deeper into the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and with three genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix up the genotypes like this in
multiple generations, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics in the plant uncouple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is the size of the kernel and
the size of the shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common that we've got great big
shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's terrific, but the kernel
inside is never any bigger than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can work the other way, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some where the kernel is so
large that the shell doesn't contain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some that they split open like a
pistachio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shell is like a good idea until you
say insects, which is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example, another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is what I'm actually
working with, and it's both very useful
[SPEAKER_00]: and very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal fruit ripens in a normal fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuts, going through the growing
season, the nut starts to turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ages a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nut absizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The husk will start to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually the husk will open,
maybe drop the nudge, and then the husk
[SPEAKER_00]: will fall off the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hybrids, all of those things
uncouple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find any combination that you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one where the nut is fully brown
and fully ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nuts that are absolutely ripe,
and they don't turn brown until a month
[SPEAKER_00]: after you've harvested them, but they are
ripe, ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, more than a few of those,
they're frustrating if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: handpicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't get your pickers to pick
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue jays know it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice know it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go and pick them also.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that is giving me fits
is I early on started to select for nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be fully ripened inside the
husk with this type of a husk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which normally totally encloses the nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The husk would not ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nut's ripe, but the husk is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that fools the blue jays and
probably the deer mice, which are two of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest thieves until you get the
squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're way out in the soybean field
kind of an area, there aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: squirrels out there, but if you've got big
trees along the side, squirrels are a
[SPEAKER_00]: major problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squirrels are not fooled by this,
but the jays, woodpeckers, mice,
[SPEAKER_00]: are fooled by it, and they'll leave them
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting for that husk to start to
ripen and let them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty again comes with the human
harvesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to get them to actually
pick those bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a promising direction,
but it has unexpected side effects some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth through the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bud growth at a particular point
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant right next to it on the
same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't develop at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ripen at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a line of hazels at Badger Set that
are ripe on the calendar, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely unusual, but this line is always
ripe the last week in July, which is two
[SPEAKER_00]: months ahead of the world hazel crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular line, I'm guessing some of
those genes came from British culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ripe, full size, ripe,
done, ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the things that we think are,
whether you're looking at a wild plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant has to do this, has to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does all of those things that look like
it has to do it, because for that species
[SPEAKER_00]: and that niche, that's what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put them together, look at our
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potatoes don't look a lot like wild
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hybrid beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enormous diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look like they're wild
ancestors at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask much, much more of them than
we are used to asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some of the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again,
[SPEAKER_00]: to my eye, that has spent days and days
and days staring at these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks enormously diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that as horticulturists,
you're seeing some of the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is a canola grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is a grain of rice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in food, and what matters
is tons of kernel per acre, hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced that it's a matter of
primate hard wiring going way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way back to when we were grabbing nuts
before the leopard would eat us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans will grab the biggest nut in the
bowl, just without thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go for it, and they want the big
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has nothing to do with how much
food is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an unusually heavy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very hard to catch in
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the branches bending over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was four and a half kilos of dry,
no, 3,000 pounds per acre of dry kernel
[SPEAKER_00]: and 5,000 pounds per acre of dry nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood is part of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a waste product,
which is going to drag you crazy if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are uses for the nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are uses for the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them can put money in the
farmer's pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all has to do with this exceptional
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done without insecticides and
fungicides, and I didn't start out to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father was a truck farmer family when
he was a kid and a civil engineer as an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had those habits everywhere we
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had to spray the roses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just totally natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started working with these
hybrids, I did not spray at first because
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what the pests were,
what they were going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would see a caterpillar eating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, well, let's watch it and
find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results are 100% consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a new caterpillar that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It eats and eats and makes a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next year, you come back and they're
almost not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will show up to eat the
caterpillars if you don't spray and kill
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I do feel that spraying
insecticide or fungicide on your system is
[SPEAKER_00]: a mistake always for this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural parasites, predators,
will be there if there is something for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nothing for them to eat,
they won't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wipe out that system once,
it's the parasitic and the predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: creatures that take decades to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take so, so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have scaled up in various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my bigger outplanting in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about eight acres of hazels,
machine planted, grown as tublings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was year four, 2006, year nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were harvesting them with a
blueberry picker, a machine which works
[SPEAKER_00]: well enough at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the machine and the crop need some
more adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right there waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're driving done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually sitting back here watching the
crop come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pick this bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick this bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hit the next bush and the machine
bogs, it cannot handle the load.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bush we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the bush that we need to adapt
the machine to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we discovered at this point that
there are always inadvertent selections
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started this, I went, do your
homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else has taken a wild species recently
and made a domesticated crop out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is Irv Elke at the
University of Minnesota and Wild Rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went up and knocked on his door and
said, I'm thinking about doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, and not a big surprise,
one of the first things you've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're working with a wild species is
you've got to have the crop stay on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree so that it will be there to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all wild species drop their seed as
it ripens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to harvest it in a
quarter of an coordinated fashion,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started selecting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was way more successful than I
expected it to be, which is the way with a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out to be easy to find plants
that bear enormous crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out to be not too difficult to
find those that bear that crop every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty is you have to support them
or they will kill themselves if you let
[SPEAKER_00]: them bear without support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you support them,
they will bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, easy to find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discovered I was very, very
successful with getting the nuts to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of those bushes where that
machine is not ever going to take these
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts off of that bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human pickers can pick them off,
but they are stuck so tight that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not machine-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the diversity is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are machine-friendly bushes to be
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my most recent achievement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Oberlin, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need you to pay close attention to
the dates, because it's not believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, May 13, August 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big advantage at Oberlin was that they
don't have any real plant scientists in
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental studies program right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one who is overlooking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just did what I told them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest problems with
distributing the system is people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, I know this land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be better if I did it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost always wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are in their third leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were nuts on those bushes in
their third leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up yay big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are massively loaded with female
flowers this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be heavier than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do this if you treat them nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth jump is a huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major factor here is they got them
fertilized on time when I told them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of fertilizer that these
little guys can use is startlingly large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these hazels are being fertilized
at twice corn rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're this young, they'll just
suck it up and grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cycle three plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very iffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's packed with big fat nuts,
very thin shells, and not much to support
[SPEAKER_00]: it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle three was for nut size and nut
flavor, standard hazel flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are nice marketing points
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we hit one of the inevitable
glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white-tailed deer agreed that these
were really desirable plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole group got nailed by
white-tailed deer, far worse than the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use deer fence here at all,
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No tree protectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be able to make it on their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white-tailed deer and the North
American species have co-evolved for
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European hazel is favored browse for
white-tailed deer and for cows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did we find some survivors in all that
diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 10, 20 plants out of that cycle
three expansion that are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very much worth carrying forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody ever seen anything like that
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hybrid pecan hickory in the
springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bud breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they are so gorgeous,
but they are one after another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen wild trees do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown them to a number of pecan
people, so I've never seen a pecan do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are surprises all the time,
which are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the chestnuts, this is germinated
from the seed, and it's trying to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a string of nuts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard for those little guys to
sustain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of plant breeding,
we can get germ cells on new seedlings as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could breed three generations of
chestnuts in one year, just the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow corn, if we had growth chambers
and the work to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are willing if you have the desire
to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon State, I don't know whether
they still do this or not, but they used
[SPEAKER_00]: to for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would discard any new hybrid that had
more than five nuts in a cluster,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would automatically discard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their belief was it made the bases
of the nuts pointy, and then they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the machines, which are already
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want to have to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, that shape and the nut
cluster size are not connected in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nuts are round as marbles,
and there are 18 nuts in that cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put on a much larger harvest
object if we want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it's easier to pick one ear of
corn than the same amount of teosinte.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier than I thought it would be,
and I still puzzle about that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now for something completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a proof of what I am telling
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is also really important
horticultural and genetic news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I'm publishing by video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been working on this for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot about these guys,
but not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in 1997, I started to have
hazelnuts in the greenhouse grow up three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks old and flower like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a hazel flower at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazels are in the birch family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have catkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all highly developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, I don't think I even put a
picture in here of normal hazel catkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know what normal birch catkins
look like, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This ain't one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an insect-pollinated flower on a
three-week-old hazel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this started to pop up,
I puzzled for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that make rosettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white is pigment, not lack of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all kinds of subsidiary
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hairs that are tipped with
liquids of various kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this pattern fairly frequently,
this white throat with crimson edges and
[SPEAKER_00]: the recurved cobra head kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty advanced
insect-pollinated structure of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in a wind-pollinated plant in a
wind-pollinated family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the ancestors of the betulaceae
wind-pollinated or insect-pollinated?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were insect-pollinated, I can tell
you for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ancestral flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to put this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic instruction is necessary to
put something like that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at a minimum of 100 genes,
possibly 10 times that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many coordinated, working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their regulators are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still there in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this multi-species hybridization
that has stripped off later adaptations
[SPEAKER_00]: and exposed the default set.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the default flower set for these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how it's easy to find
plants that bear heavy crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you bear nuts or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: The default is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bearing is more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemicals in here that are
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's DNA in there that is accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that little thing come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, finally, something that looks like
stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be receptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went like crazy and managed to
get some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pollen grains there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blankety blank thing turned into a
leaf growing right up out of the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Molnar Rutgers has seen these once on
a cross between two full sibs where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's enormous inbreeding so that
there's probably some confusion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: structures there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one from Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those blebs out there, those look exactly
like what we know in the tropics as food
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies to feed ants, to feed beetles,
to draw them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like the food bodies that
we see on many other kinds of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosette formers have scalloped edges
frequently that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flowers are not functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeples, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we've got liquid-tipped hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't develop normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's senesced into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They senesce and stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quirky parts here are
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants never do this again in their
second leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never flower this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They revert to normal hazel growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce normal flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce normal nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've planted the nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crossed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the progeny out in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it happen again anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their progeny so far don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of crossing to do there yet
to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phenomenon is not easily
reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kill insects regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They capture insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a suggestion I have that possibly
insect pollination is secondary to
[SPEAKER_00]: carnivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants may have been carnivorous
first, caught insects, vibrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: started to carry pollen and insect
pollination may have come that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all I know, these are angiosperm
ancestral flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're way back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can senesce and then break out and
start to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A completely different category of odd
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had catkins in the greenhouse change
sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a male catkin that has become
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are normal nuts on the plant at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce nutlets and they produce what
people say those are almost certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: embryoids, naked embryoids sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I can repeat reliably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have discovered that we can also
find these in the field now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only on hazel catkins that have been
infested with big bud mite where there is
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of a plant hormone involved
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those catkins can play this little trick
where they will produce embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the embryoids are probably
apomictic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put pollen on these things but I'm not
convinced we've ever actually got a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce dry nutlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are embryos inside the nutlets as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you can see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't develop into a seed but they're
available for embryo rescue if we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year Jeff Zarnowski, Jeff are you
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere he was going to be here,
who lives up by Cortland and grows our
[SPEAKER_00]: hazels, found one of his hazels in the
field doing this all over the plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, which I have never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point what I'm thinking is we're
looking at ancestral birch flowers perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hazels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The practicality is if you can make these
things function you're looking at an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of fruit set on one
structure, kind of the way corn came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Teyacinte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know what that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is food here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is chestnut polenta bread from these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, there's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the last line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be here for three days today
and the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk with anybody about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works better than I guessed and
particularly if you do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice for being a paracetologist,
it took me 15 years looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a pathogen, it's a commensal
organism that grows with both of the
[SPEAKER_00]: native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at it all across the continent
really and you will never find a dead
[SPEAKER_00]: native hazel from EFB.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will find is a perfectly healthy
hazel with two very very old branches that
[SPEAKER_00]: have got EFB that are now, that breaks
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it removes all the wood for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills European hazel good folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about all this food being
produced, how do you see it being used as
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that people actually consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people don't really, maybe they
eat a couple of hazelnuts or they... No,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bread was made with this and it took
me years to come up with this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hazelnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a chestnut flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cooked, which actually makes it
much easier and then it's extruded into
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny very uniform particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tested it extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pollen is eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that you use cornmeal or whole
wheat for, you can substitute basically
[SPEAKER_00]: one for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no gluten in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the few complaints we got back from
it, from a food writer, was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: people she tested it on thought it was too
normal, which in fact is what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got a longer shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we have kept this for two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common dry storage, just like this,
without it going bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep flour that long on cornmeal
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was cooked, hot, sterilized and
then put in a sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a much cleaner container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from hazel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is chestnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chestnut is a high carbohydrate moderate
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it dry, it's 10% dry
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's primarily a carbohydrate crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hazel and the pecan both are very
high in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oil is very easily pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hazels are about 60% oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the chemical twin of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an entrepreneur in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point running with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to really publish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good video that was published a
couple of years ago and there are people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if somebody has got a huge supply
of chestnuts that spoil all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know what to do with them,
any commercial chestnut processor could be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the business of doing this in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut, steam, peel, cook, extrude,
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should all come up and see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hybrid chestnut grown on a night
farm in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have never seen rings like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I put it around is because
pictures don't get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put your hand on it,
look at them, and those are rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're enormously productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hazel wood, which is hard and very
high fuel value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nut shell is produced every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of calorimeter tests on
the nut shell and it's, I can't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of my head, something like
9,000 BTU per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high, very low ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grounded in the stuff at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making biochar out of it more slowly
than I would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's potential for easy crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an enormous amount of production
that you have to do something about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue with those grad students who
will be joining Phil for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
