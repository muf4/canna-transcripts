[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Masters Week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like the world stops
for us in the golf world when this
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in honor of that, we got a sports turf
discussion today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to find a way to twist
this thing into a golf discussion to the
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, and I'm going to ask you a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering your thoughts,
because there are some things I think for
[SPEAKER_00]: golf folks that are listening that I think
will be really fascinating because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to look at putting surfaces in a
way that you used to look at baseball in
[SPEAKER_00]: fields, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golfers are athletes, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl and I got this note from our good pal
Rick Slattery, who's down at the Masters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did he say, Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: He walked 25 miles in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, he's putting the steps in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is putting the steps in and thrilled to
see a pimento cheese sandwich for $1.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody that gets down there knows
that's exactly how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, come on with this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taped his mouth shut because he couldn't
hold his tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was getting himself so upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear your thoughts on,
you know, taping your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this should be something we could
use in other parts of our lives as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should it be confined to this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts about the mentality
that drives a golfer to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculousness?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this speaks to my theory that
golf just makes people crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can see really smart
people just in all other walks of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you put a golf club in
their hand, it is all out the window for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this poor guy, I think, played a
corn fairy event like this and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, was completely serious about it
helping his game.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of guys that don't need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as an old guy myself now,
I just want to raise everybody's attention
[SPEAKER_00]: that while Ludwig Oldborg at 20 years old
or 21 years old is on the leaderboard,
[SPEAKER_00]: my man, Freddy Couples, is T13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bernhard Langer, 67 years old,
will probably be the oldest guy to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at even par right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how it goes today and what
he's able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're very excited about these two old
guys really showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about firmness on putting
surfaces, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're in the, we're going to talk
about your line of work and that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: currently doing with Biocore and in field
safety and measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at a variety of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Clegg hammer on the right making
an indent and either a traditional true
[SPEAKER_00]: firm or even the PGA railroad ball bearing
that they drop at a uniform height to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very commonly discussed term
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting more widely known.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is not as widely studied and known is
the strength of that surface, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you studied this a little bit with
your clay work years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, no matter if it,
and of course this may be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: masters they have that's really firm and
fast because they get rain all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they run those sub airs and oh,
everybody's the sub air thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this still happens in the top
millimeter, no matter how much they run
[SPEAKER_00]: that sub air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you are back in your Pittsburgh
pirate days as a working man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're, now you're a senior engineer
with Biocore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we had you on years ago,
you know, when you were doing your infield
[SPEAKER_00]: work, we were talking about cleat in,
cleat out and how the ball was responding
[SPEAKER_00]: to these clay surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question to start this out before I
get to the weather and we get to the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sports conversation today is what
are your thoughts about ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially measuring this or
understanding it a little bit better on a
[SPEAKER_00]: putting surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I feel only a little ambushed by
this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think real quick, just from an
engineering standpoint, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all different kinds of
gobbledygook terms that people use to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Young's module is elastic modulus,
shear modulus, and all these terms
[SPEAKER_02]: describe the way that a material deforms
in different directions under different
[SPEAKER_02]: means of loads.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So firmness is typically thought about in
the vertical direction or normal forces,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas the shearing strength,
I think that's pretty intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people understand shear
strength to be in sort of a perpendicular
[SPEAKER_02]: or coplanar direction to the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in, in sand root zones, we're really
relying mostly on the anchoring of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grass plants to provide the stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: My old advisor, Andy McNett, he would say,
you know, we've tried in the past to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to stabilize sand root zones by changing
the particle size distribution or this
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the CU concept that's really
caught on in the golf course world for
[SPEAKER_02]: firmness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you do this sort of thought
experiment when you have an athlete
[SPEAKER_02]: running around on the surface with no
grass, if you had this high, high CU sand,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very non-uniform and ideally you
could have some of the particle packing
[SPEAKER_02]: working to fill it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think that's going to stay
stable as a surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I mean, the reality is those athletes
are going to still blow that sand all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're really relying on the network of
roots and rhizomes in the case of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Kentucky bluegrass sports field
or a Bermuda grass field on a golf course.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's a bank grass or even a
bent POA surface, you're relying more on
[SPEAKER_02]: the stolen Iphorus growth habit,
which is contributing to this organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I guess that's kind of a starting
point for the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really, I think in this case
concerned a little bit more with the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic materials, whether they're living
or dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then certainly the degree of
decomposition on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ambush you and you give me an answer
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do this more often to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was absolutely brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying, there's two parts to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is how do we measure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To simulate a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of discrepancies even in
dropping a thing down on the surface to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine it, you know, is it correlated
to moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it correlated to organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, we have this, the USGA
method of organic matter testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the OM246 where you're honing in on the
two millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, this is,
there's no answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's great about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beginning of the thinking of
how we have to measure this because
[SPEAKER_00]: firmness is only part of the equation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it firm, but when you get
those forces from other directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you consider the spin
rate, if they're hitting a close iron that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use the grooves and get the spin
on the ball, it really adds quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the day,
what does a golf course superintendent do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we verticut and put more sand in
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we need to airify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it a, does brushing help?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think we understand
really what it takes to manage that upper
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even where this reaction is occurring
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a deep thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the ball hits it, we're only talking
about a millimeter or two, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than your sports field where the
cleat is entering into the substrate a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The surface surface really is what you're
managing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, honestly it's similar to an
infield skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really managing that top,
you know, maybe inch or usually less than
[SPEAKER_02]: that, just where the cleats are
interacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case where the ball is
interacting, I think one thing that sticks
[SPEAKER_02]: out to me on this picture, you can see
obviously the living plant material on
[SPEAKER_02]: top, but this sort of turf slime or
relatively degraded organic or
[SPEAKER_02]: intermediate degraded organic matter
anyway, which has very little shear
[SPEAKER_02]: strength and probably whose physical
properties is highly dependent on the
[SPEAKER_02]: water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That type of material has a very high
water holding capacity due to its sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular structure and sort of randomly
oriented organic molecules, but also will
[SPEAKER_02]: depend highly on the water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it's dry, it's pretty stiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably compressed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it starts to absorb water,
it's going to swell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if there is some sand in that top
layer, some grit, that swelling can
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially open up that medium so that
the sand grains are no longer in such
[SPEAKER_02]: intimate contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the weather and then we're
going to get to the meat of the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about temperature in a
minute, but when you look at sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall across the region, there are very
few places, maybe along the Great Lakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were a little bit drier and it
looks like the coast is going to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: wetter than inland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're along the coast, you can
expect quite a bit of rainfall in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a washout of a weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm not in a baseball business
because I'll be dragging a tarp a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: amount in this kind of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the golf world, seedhead suppression,
you're pretty late now for your first
[SPEAKER_00]: application of proxy for the spring,
which seems very odd to be saying that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're pretty late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you still have some embark lying
around and you're one of those folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: still use embark, you still have a little
bit of time, particularly into upstate New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were talking about soils in
the low fifties, mid fifties last week at
[SPEAKER_00]: the two inch level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're hard pressed to find the
soil in the fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked to Arti Gaetano,
who was our guest last week about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in the spring time,
that two inch soil temperature is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: track the air temperature pretty closely
and even cooler with moisture in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, we're wet and we're
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been cooler than normal region
wide, you know, two to minus two degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: at normal, maybe a little bit above
normal, but not essentially what we would
[SPEAKER_00]: think we'd be warming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like cool and wet is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight to 14 day probabilities are
looking like at least for the next week,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe until May, we're going to be pretty
wet and cool, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the pretty typical spring stall
that we talk about every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was 17 degrees just the other
day in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shuddered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that a lot of fruit trees have
not broken dormancy yet, because then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be in all sorts of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you put all this together and we
look at our growth potential model,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be nice and easy to see
grass isn't growing in New York state and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to be grown for a few more
days anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you talk about athletic
fields, and I thought I'd start out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture from Greg Chorvis, a regular
contributor and listener to the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: sending a picture from a local school
district that I think he worked with a
[SPEAKER_00]: while ago, trying to help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people got involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I maybe you want to believe
well-intentioned, but not really smart
[SPEAKER_00]: about just dumping ditch material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, do I have this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They cleaned out the community ditches and
they dumped it on these baseball fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently that's not their only
problem, because if you take a wrong step,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to kill yourself on these
stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously clear that the grass
isn't growing and fields aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year, you know, you get
reports that fields are being overused,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when they're not growing and
they look unsafe like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put kids on them and all of a sudden
you get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we start to talk more about face
planting concussions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, concussion care for
parents and young people that are on these
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we oftentimes think of firmness,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some experience having to report
about concussions in division one athletes
[SPEAKER_00]: from my time serving the athletic
department here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of years ago, we put together
a concussion report from various sports,
[SPEAKER_00]: from football and soccer to ice hockey,
wrestling and lacrosse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we have many, many years
where we're above average, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: man or woman sports, you can get a high
number of concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously we're not talking about ice
in this particular presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we try to make adaptations,
right guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make adaptations to the game to
try to prevent this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new kickoff rule in football is
certainly a demonstration of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small percentage of the number of
plays in a football game, American
[SPEAKER_00]: football game, but it has a higher
percentage of concussion and injuries
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we go and test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we start to get into the
discussion about firmness and testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: we care a lot about this, but it's almost
non-existent at the high school and
[SPEAKER_00]: collegiate level that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would think it's safe to say
other than the companies that come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: test the synthetic surfaces, virtually no
one in the Ivy league is testing their
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces for safety and performance other
than the synthetic turf people that put
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to remind everybody, we have a
really good sports field management
[SPEAKER_00]: website, which we are in the process now
of updating and looking forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: launching that in the next year in an
updated fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there's the best management
practices for sports fields that SFMA or
[SPEAKER_00]: back then the STMA, the New England people
really led this charge and you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: this publication pretty easily on the web
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Carl, so now I'm ready for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recalling recently that there was
back in maybe 2002 or 2004 or 2006 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the season, Bill Belichick
decides to pull out natural grass and put
[SPEAKER_00]: in synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now he's down at UNC with little
Wayne and his new girlfriend and he wants
[SPEAKER_00]: natural grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's down from one end to the other
where he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, early I was talking about
firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about traction,
which brings in these multiple forces,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the downward force, but these
rotational forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carl, maybe I hope I set you up enough
to start the discussion with Evan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Evan, you set it up really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The direction of the force and how we
measure that probably matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used, and last year we did this
testing about twice a week on our fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: a variety of fields here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got the really simple Turf Tech
Shear Strength Tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that coplanar, as Kevin
mentioned, you stick it in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: you rotate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a shearing number,
a force that, the maximum sort of force
[SPEAKER_01]: before the turf breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's different things you can put
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at the data last year,
we were really looking at it for our
[SPEAKER_01]: soccer teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those watching the yellow line on this
graph, that's our game field, Kentucky
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluegrass predominantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot of practices, just games
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: McGovern is our practice field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both men's and women's have their own
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Po'o Rye field and a satellite
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at the traction data
last year, that Kentucky Bluegrass surface
[SPEAKER_01]: Berman had higher traction numbers in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we got into the season,
August, September, when we start playing
[SPEAKER_01]: on that field, they really sort of
narrowed to match the McGovern field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at the firmness data,
if we look at the ball roll data,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Berman was sort of different than the
practice field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got, they sort of coalesced
together towards the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, part of that is probably more
rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Sicko, our director of grounds and
sports turf, took the height down a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit on the bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what he also did was he added ryegrass
in June on that bluegrass field at Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a great catch of that over seeded
rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we saw that rye come in,
we saw the traction values go down and
[SPEAKER_01]: start to match that Po'o Rye traction of
the McGovern field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're starting to think about the
growth habit of the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan, you mentioned that shearing is
really a function of sort of the vegetated
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and organic material down below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're wondering like, is that why
that ryegrass in place of bluegrass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why we're seeing these things
coalesce?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, Evan, you guys measure traction
in a much more complicated way with the
[SPEAKER_01]: beast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This huge machine, you're riding on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some pictures on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I want to set you up, Evan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you measure traction in this sort
of way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's coming in at different
angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably rotating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the traction device is very
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too simple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really capturing everything we'd
want to know when we're considering
[SPEAKER_01]: traction?
[SPEAKER_02]: As you alluded, there's a number of
different variables that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: control in this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Athletes have all sorts of different
sizes, different cleat engagements,
[SPEAKER_02]: both within sports, within age groups,
within even genders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this device, the beast,
is designed very specifically around NFL
[SPEAKER_02]: size athletes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is configurable, so the weight stack
can be changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was developed in response to a
desire by the league to really attack
[SPEAKER_02]: lower extremity injuries, which comprise
about 60% of the injury burden in the
[SPEAKER_02]: league.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the concussions often gets a lot of the
press, but in terms of total time missed,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower extremity injuries actually play
a little bit bigger role.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this device, one of the main,
so that's number one, is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: replicates the loads and the forces
associated with the extremely large
[SPEAKER_02]: athletes in the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Carl, you mentioned yesterday,
which position, Evan, is it the linemen
[SPEAKER_00]: who have to plant that heavy weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the receiver who's running lightly
to make a cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the quarterback who's stepping back
and plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get the force you want to
replicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go to the most extreme?
[SPEAKER_02]: Several years ago, there was a
biomechanical study done with professional
[SPEAKER_02]: football athletes running around on force
plates, highly instrumented, artificial
[SPEAKER_02]: turf surface, to get a sense of what are
the vertical loads?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the shearing forces that they
actually apply to the surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much can they use?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do they need?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has been done in other places in
the literature in the past, both with
[SPEAKER_02]: American football and with other athletes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically use the 50th percentile
NFL athlete to represent this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that we found,
and this actually persists across sports,
[SPEAKER_02]: that generally the most energetic
maneuvers apply about two and a half times
[SPEAKER_02]: the player's body weight to the surface at
the peak vertical loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so just to be clear, 300 pound
linemen are putting 800 pounds or 700
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of force down?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, and that's why this device
looks so much bigger than an NFL athlete,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It weighs a lot more, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing to think about
positionally is the mode of cleat
[SPEAKER_02]: engagement can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You alluded to the linemen sort of digging
in at that lower angle with the receivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be turning abruptly to make a V
cut, but they're also often accelerating
[SPEAKER_02]: and decelerating at very high speeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes those high speed
decelerations are associated with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the non-contact injuries, like you
referred to in the kickoffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly think of the head-to-head,
the sort of violent collisions between the
[SPEAKER_02]: players and their helmets, but also that
hard deceleration is associated with a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of ACL injuries and other things in that
sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where I wanted to get to,
is you guys presented at that Loftsboro
[SPEAKER_01]: International Sport Conference that you
turned us on to last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is data from the beast,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On a variety of different surfaces,
there's synthetic, there's Kentucky
[SPEAKER_01]: bluegrass on its own, there's bluegrass or
ryegrass stitched in with the artificial,
[SPEAKER_01]: so these hybrid surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could just talk a little bit
about some of the findings there,
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan, and what's interesting about
different kinds of synthetic, different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of natural, and maybe why we're
seeing the stuff at Berman with the
[SPEAKER_01]: traction values differing now that we
added perennial ryegrass in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm always impressed at your guys'
ability to find, from one link to still
[SPEAKER_02]: information that you find always the
critical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, as you mentioned, this was
presented at a sports engineering
[SPEAKER_02]: conference last summer, 2024, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an experiment that we did at a
couple of different locations,
[SPEAKER_02]: including our plot here at Biocore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the different colors of lines
represent the traction response of each
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you haven't seen a graph like this
before to the audience to walk you through
[SPEAKER_02]: it, on the x-axis is the degree of
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's measured in degrees starting out
from the original cleat position and then
[SPEAKER_02]: rotating through a full turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice that the axis goes all
the way up to 100 degrees, which if you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about rotating your knee 100
degrees, that's well past where your
[SPEAKER_02]: ligaments will start to give way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we refer to this as an injury test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're interested in not only the peak
load that builds up, but also the rate
[SPEAKER_02]: that it builds up and how much load is
required to move the cleat through a given
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the y-axis here is the torque,
which is actually the same unit that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're measuring on that turf tech shear
vein.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice where the numbers are in
order of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher given the higher normal force or
the vertical load.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, each of the lines represents a
different surface tested with this beast
[SPEAKER_02]: device.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice there's a big span,
not only in the peak load, but also the
[SPEAKER_02]: displacement associated with where the
cleat releases or where it reaches its
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum force.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the synthetic turf lines on the
left, the gray ones, they're a lot steeper
[SPEAKER_02]: and they also reach a higher peak load.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purplish lines associated with the
bluegrass and the stitched high ribs in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bluegrass at different densities,
they tend not to reach quite as high peak
[SPEAKER_02]: load and they take longer to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing we're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only the total force that builds up,
but how do you get to that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one really cool thing that you
can measure with this sort of device that
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't captured by a manual or handheld
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Carl, before we get to the last slide,
Evan, in simple terms, this is you plant
[SPEAKER_00]: your foot and you're more likely to slip a
little bit on natural grass and less
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to slip a little bit on synthetic
turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say slip, I mean the subtlest
of sort of slippage that takes that energy
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a fair- I would partially agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would shy away from using the term slip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think oftentimes when we see an athlete
slip or we refer to that, it's a less
[SPEAKER_02]: complete cleat engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes the studs may not be
penetrating all the way into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's more like that initial picture
you showed of the golf ball really just
[SPEAKER_02]: touching the, whether it's the thatch,
the mat, however you want to label that
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of intermingled organic layer,
or sometimes in a very dense, maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: ryegrass surface that's wet and slick,
sometimes the cleats don't engage fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not necessarily what this test
is after, but I do agree with the part
[SPEAKER_02]: about in general, the grass is more,
we call it more compliant or not as stiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it does begin to release or to
deflate or to form at least in a more
[SPEAKER_02]: significant way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, the $64,000 question is
where's the sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I getting maximum performance and
also, or optimized performance that also
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizes for my safety, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it looks like where they stitch,
where you put synthetic fibers in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know Ryan Woodley's got this in the
outfield now for the brewers, it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like where they stitch, it's stiffer,
less compliant, you would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worrisome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the stitching now, are they able to,
and I'm sure they are, stitch at different
[SPEAKER_00]: densities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that then change the stiffness?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that the way to optimize,
one of the ways to optimize performance
[SPEAKER_00]: with safety?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so first of all, just to reiterate
what you described, there is a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: envelope, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the floor of traction where you
need to have some be able to run around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like running on a beach,
but then there's some upper limit where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a concern that the foot can become
fixated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to answer the second part of your
question, I think the purple, so the
[SPEAKER_02]: purple and the blue lines that hopefully
for people that can see, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: colorblind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is actually a colorblind
friendly color palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, I know you're an R user.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a colorblind R package by Klaus
Willis.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any case, so the four purple lines,
you've got the bottom solid, which is just
[SPEAKER_02]: the pure Kentucky bluegrass, and then
stitched at three different densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we find that the higher the fiber
volume within a given area or root zone
[SPEAKER_02]: volume, as you might expect, the traction
becomes stiffer and more significant in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the peak load.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's interesting because it
suggests that you can control the
[SPEAKER_02]: available traction depending on the way
that the surface is constructed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue lines are Bermuda grass with the
same stitching rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice they're squashed
together a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we would hypothesize that this is
probably because the Bermuda grass already
[SPEAKER_02]: has such a robust network of the roots and
underground stems that it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the word benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we mean that correctly,
but at least directionally, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: enhanced in terms of traction by as much
as the bluegrass might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's maybe why Belichick likes the
natural grass going down south or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bermuda grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bermuda grass going down south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you are coming to his defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm throwing a Hail Mary there on my
hypothesis, maybe that's why we like
[SPEAKER_01]: natural grass on the warm seasons that
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it comes down to this
debate of grass versus turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really not as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this graph doesn't really depict that
super well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you squint, you can actually see
one gray line that is beneath two of the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue lines, which is a hybrid and kind of
right in the carpet, the yellow carpet
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some grasses which have
higher traction loads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when they're hybridized
than some of the synthetic fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes, coaches especially will get
an idea in their head that I want grass,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want turf, and it's not really an
absolute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll also just point out that since
that happened, I don't remember the year
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology and the skill of the sod
growers has really evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so grass in that era, probably not so
comparable to some of the grass that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can obtain even late in the season now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is interesting because as we've
talked about or we'll talk about more over
[SPEAKER_00]: the show is when the World Cup comes,
they're going to play on that carpet
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the natural grass planted in a
synthetic surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that looks like it's pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's a different animal to a certain
extent with soccer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like that ball to skid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a round ball sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does look like it's closer to
synthetic as far as traction or less
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant, so to speak, than it is to
natural grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering, they can also play
around with fiber density in that hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure they're going to use this
data to determine what's the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's a pretty smart guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only three products that we
tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, we sort of made ourselves
like a homemade kind of off-label carpet
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid with super high fiber density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this doesn't necessarily reflect
the suite of products that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: available or might become available
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, here's your last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so the great thing is that Evan
already nailed this for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask the question,
are different athletes different loads?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Evan, you already answered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part I liked about this slide,
Frank, was Declan Rice there, my guy for
[SPEAKER_01]: Arsenal Football Club, with two gorgeous
free kick goals against Real Madrid the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just top level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we answered the idea that maybe
different sports and different athletes
[SPEAKER_01]: within a sport, linemen, receivers
experience loads differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got a question from Ben Palmer who
asked here, Evan, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you could talk about this, but you guys
collect data for the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there instances where the turf,
and a lot of that is safety data,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these fields safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we look at injury rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably you can't comment too much on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have the turf managers used that data
that you collect and implemented certain
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that allowed them to get to
higher or lower on the traction scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you can talk to about
sort of the turf managers at stadiums
[SPEAKER_01]: using that data from you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the turf managers in general are
pretty excited about having another tool
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at to track and monitor things
over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still sort of in the infancy of
determining how do you go from a traction
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement to something you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pretty good amount of research
in the literature using other traction
[SPEAKER_02]: devices about how to influence the shoot
density and potentially the root mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing we're excited about is
working with the manufacturers and the sod
[SPEAKER_02]: growers because a lot of times they govern
kind of what you're able to deal with once
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in the field manager scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the high end football case,
obviously there's pretty frequent
[SPEAKER_02]: replacement schedule associated with
concerts and also with the high use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we definitely look forward to providing
them more things that are useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be a focus moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I can't let you go without
having some conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're really over to 30 minutes,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't as fast as we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to ask a question about
something you just said there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, which is, boy, you really enjoy
being able to work with the sod growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and it feels like the turf grass managers
can make adaptations in the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find the same thing to be true with
synthetic turf manufacturers and people
[SPEAKER_00]: that can manage those fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you more constrained when you get a
particular type of synthetic field based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what you've seen in the NFL?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is one of the beautiful things
about natural grass, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it can be shaped and molded,
you know, ecologically, depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: the management variables are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of the sports turf manager is the
most critical, you know, the spoon that
[SPEAKER_02]: stirs the pot, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there's appetite in the
synthetic turf world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see how it's evolved from,
you know, the sort of dark ages of stadium
[SPEAKER_02]: construction, the donut hole stadiums,
you know, in the 1970s and the turf that
[SPEAKER_02]: people used to play on then compared to
what it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes how quickly we forget both
on the natural grass side, going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the early 90s, playing in the soup bowl
stadiums and then also the artificial
[SPEAKER_02]: turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think both ends of that dichotomy
have progressed pretty significantly and
[SPEAKER_02]: will continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a very good answer, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to make a really good senior
engineer from BioCorps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, it's so great to chat with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we can bring up first principle
things, right, Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: With forces and things like that,
we're very happy to talk about engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of... Not so bad for a turf
grass guy who turned out to be an engineer
[SPEAKER_00]: with BioCorps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your brewers need some pitching,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure your brewers need some
pitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pirates need some pitching too,
other than that one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Carl, good to see you both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you all next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Ev.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you, bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Have a great week.
