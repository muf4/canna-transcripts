[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I was saying is that we're going
to split the talk into two halves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give the first half and then
hand it off to Yolanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first half I'm going to talk about
is a little bit about our position and
[SPEAKER_04]: then mostly about New York City and urban
agriculture in New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Yolanda will talk about the
challenges that we found as we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: working with people over the last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know about it, it's big.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very big.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 304 square miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as it's sort of physically
compared to upstate New York, the winters
[SPEAKER_04]: are milder.
[SPEAKER_04]: The summers are hotter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a moderating effect of the ocean
being there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also further south.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the urban heat island effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a big factor that we're still
sort of figuring out what that has to do
[SPEAKER_04]: with urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it can mean, for example, that in
summertime it means hotter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peak temperatures in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it means warmer nights in summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes as much as seven degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than just outside the
[SPEAKER_04]: city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that can be a big factor that we're
still sort of figuring out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, it's obviously very
populous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggest city in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most densely populated city in the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by a pretty wide margin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And very culturally diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes with, I mean, you can see a
little bit from the map, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't spend too much time on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see a little bit from each
color being different racial and ethnic
[SPEAKER_04]: groups that there is some segregation
built into the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like historical segregation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And structural inequalities that come with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that overlays a lot with the work that
we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's just high cost of living
in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of a fact of life in New
York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sort of plays a big role in a lot
of different ways that urban agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: takes shape as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our position, this position was created
just a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started just a little over a year
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: The program didn't exist before that in
the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Yolanda and I were hired to be the
urban agriculture specialist in New York
[SPEAKER_04]: City.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically bring agricultural extension
into the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our sort of central focus is to build
educational programs and other support for
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk a little bit more about
what we mean by commercial or what the
[SPEAKER_04]: description means.
[SPEAKER_04]: But mostly it's an extension position
doing program development and a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: individual technical assistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And manual labor, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So New York urban or New York City urban
agriculture takes a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are dealing primarily with what we're
calling commercial urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're classifying as commercial,
which is for profit and privately owned
[SPEAKER_04]: operations, like you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also includes a lot of nonprofits,
which are growing produce and selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes back into their budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're including them as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're still calling it commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also includes a lot of very small
operations, backyards, and people selling
[SPEAKER_04]: $1,000 worth of tomatoes within their
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That counts as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, there are also,
we're not going to spend as much time on
[SPEAKER_04]: it today, but very important, other forms
of urban agriculture in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And community gardens are a really big
presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, there are a lot of other
nonprofits that aren't selling what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're growing or aren't selling very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of their food is being donated to
schools, to food pantries, or just sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: within the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Community gardens are sort of the
foundation of urban agriculture in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been around for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the present day community garden
movement in the city really took off in
[SPEAKER_04]: the 70s and 80s and had a lot to do with
green space preservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that remains a really important role
of community gardens in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are over 700 in total throughout the
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: This map just shows Green Thumb Gardens,
which is sort of the division of the New
[SPEAKER_04]: York City Parks Department.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they run the largest portion of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are another one or 200 that aren't
even on this map.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see concentrations of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in central and eastern Brooklyn
and in the Bronx and in Harlem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about the operations we
work with more often, the farms and the
[SPEAKER_04]: market gardens, you can see a little bit
of overlap where this blue, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: nonprofit sites, and up here, too,
overlap some with where the gardens are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to be in similar neighborhoods,
and there's a lot of those two go
[SPEAKER_04]: hand-in-hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the community gardens function
as a nonprofit farm, which is a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: other topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll also see that the red dots,
the for-profit enterprises are sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: cluster here in northern Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a lot of hydroponic operations
that are in industrial zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're scattered around the
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we found 34, 35 so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think there are others.
[SPEAKER_04]: That fit this description.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the nonprofits, like I said,
they are growing spaces operated by
[SPEAKER_04]: mission-driven nonprofits, mission-besides
food production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So education, workforce development,
food justice or social justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of the food is sold for
project revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that money goes right back into
paying farm staff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the reasons we do think
of it as a commercial enterprise or as a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial agriculture, because it is
economic development in a very direct way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that we find in a lot of the
nonprofit operations is crops being grown
[SPEAKER_04]: with the neighboring community in mind,
often because the neighboring community is
[SPEAKER_04]: participating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that includes, for example,
in eastern or central Brooklyn,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a large Caribbean community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a lot of amaranth greens
grown for callaloo, bitter melon,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was brought up from the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all over the city, there's a lot of
collard greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other sort of category is the
for-profit and privately owned operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of the indoor and hydroponic
operations fall into this category.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the soil-based rooftop farms are
more likely to be for-profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: For-profit businesses are more likely to
be growing high-value products in the
[SPEAKER_04]: city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So high-end salad greens, like you see
here at Gotham Greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, that's basil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, high-end salad greens and herbs,
they do both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also specialty enterprises like
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: This on the bottom, they grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all hot peppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in order to supplement their
revenue, because it's difficult to make
[SPEAKER_04]: enough income just from selling produce in
the city, there will be supplementary
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue from hosting events, consulting on
other projects, and people will pay to do
[SPEAKER_04]: tours and workshops on the sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also some of these projects,
especially the hydroponic ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: will have venture capital behind them,
which we'll get into more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other way that we sort of look at
the two different or another way of
[SPEAKER_04]: dividing the categorizing the urban
agriculture enterprises in the city is
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of indoor versus outdoor to kind of
oversimplify.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so indoor being, in our case,
sort of shorthand for controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: environment agriculture, or CEA,
which is an acronym we'll probably say a
[SPEAKER_04]: few more times.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are mostly hydroponic operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, greens and herbs most commonly.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them are startup enterprises with
investment behind them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either the owner put their own capital
into it, and they had a lot of capital,
[SPEAKER_04]: or they brought in venture capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes a lot of or a few
alternative enterprises, which include
[SPEAKER_04]: aquaculture and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should mention this last,
this is square roots, which is one that
[SPEAKER_04]: gets a bit of press.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in a shipping container in
Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a bunch of shipping containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other side of that operation
type being the soil-based or outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: farms, which can be at ground level or
some of them are on rooftop, on rooftops
[SPEAKER_04]: where they brought the soil up.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are more likely to be non-profit or
maybe they're for profit, but they have a
[SPEAKER_04]: similar mission sort of built into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're more likely to be diversified
vegetable operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, this example here, Staten
Island Family Farm is obviously it's on
[SPEAKER_04]: Staten Island, and it's one that you walk
around there, and Augustine, the farmer,
[SPEAKER_04]: has been there for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an acre or so of what looks like just
a miniaturized diversified vegetable farm
[SPEAKER_04]: that could have been in the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are a number of farms sort of
like that, especially around the edges of
[SPEAKER_04]: the city where there's more land available
or where there's basically any land
[SPEAKER_04]: available that you can farm right into
that ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are a lot of different sort of
soil-based operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a side note on that is that
actually the majority of these that we
[SPEAKER_04]: found in the city are not growing in the
soil, the native soil on the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even when it is native soil,
it's very often actually fill,
[SPEAKER_04]: dredged, like brought in from the bay or
construction fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: But two-thirds or more of the sort of
soil-based sites that we found are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: in imported soils or sort of soil-like
media, like purchased topsoil from
[SPEAKER_04]: nurseries, which is often mixed with
compost or heavily mended afterwards with
[SPEAKER_04]: compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rooftop mixes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rooftop farms a lot of times will
have a really lightweight blend in order
[SPEAKER_04]: to meet the weight requirements of the
roof, which comes with its own sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then actually the biggest piece of
this pie here is 100% compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the most common single sort of
growing media in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city gives away, the Department of
Sanitation gives away bagged compost for
[SPEAKER_04]: free from their sort of big municipal
compost sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very high carbon, as far as we can
tell, very high carbon compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of like wood chips and leaf litter
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so because it's given away for free,
a lot of people use that as their primary
[SPEAKER_04]: growing medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that raises a whole lot of other
interesting questions, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: slideshow in itself that we won't get
into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so here's a map of those,
differentiating those two different types
[SPEAKER_04]: of operations, the lighter green being the
hydroponic and CEA operations,
[SPEAKER_04]: darker green being soil-based.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that a lot of the dark
green dot soil-based are more around the
[SPEAKER_04]: fringes of the city and the hydroponics
are especially in that cluster in northern
[SPEAKER_04]: Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, to divide the sort of looking
at the two, again, indoor outdoor being a
[SPEAKER_04]: shorthand for those two different groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the difference in enterprises
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the dark blue is the sort of
primary enterprise of the sites we visited
[SPEAKER_04]: and the light blue being sort of
additional secondary enterprises or side
[SPEAKER_04]: enterprises.
[SPEAKER_04]: So outdoor enterprises or outdoor
operations focus on diversified vegetables
[SPEAKER_04]: in almost every case, often because it's
part of their mission rather than because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the most profitable thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also have a whole lot of
secondary enterprises, including a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: herbs, cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see honey and eggs and some perennial
fruits too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor enterprises are more focused,
less diversified, and again, focusing on
[SPEAKER_04]: high value for the space and high
turnover.
[SPEAKER_04]: So herbs, especially basil, high-end salad
greens, mostly lettuce, and microgreens,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then a few alternative enterprises.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see some room for growth or
additional enterprises down the road in
[SPEAKER_04]: especially fish or aquaculture and
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one person growing spirulina
and we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, I'm going to hand it off
to Yolanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a mic, so I'm just going to
be using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have kind of a general
overview of the different types of urban
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, this portion is going to be
focusing on the challenges, both
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-based and CEA controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started about a year ago in
October of 2017, we really wanted to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better sense of how we were going to
direct our efforts in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conducted an informal needs
assessment and we visited and interviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 different commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had discussions with other stakeholders,
including non-commercial farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also consulted with a few urban ag
leaders, maybe familiar with Karen
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and other ag service providers
in the city like Grown YC and Just Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also did some background research
on other urban ag surveys and assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe familiar with the Five Borough Farm
Project, just to build off of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: already, the research that's already
taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenges can really be summed
into three main categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space, funding, and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these upcoming slides are just going
to dive deeper into the specifics of each
[SPEAKER_00]: of those challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within soil-based operations,
space is obviously a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of ground level space,
we talked about how in the periphery of
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City and Staten Island,
Randall's Island, you have more open
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Manhattan, Brooklyn, yeah,
mostly Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens,
[SPEAKER_00]: space is more limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lack of ground level space is an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical challenges, Sam mentioned,
oftentimes the soil is contaminated by
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times the soil needs to be
imported.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also shade from nearby buildings,
which is a challenge for growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we mentioned, this is Hellgate
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing on a quarter acre on a
rooftop and primarily produce hot peppers
[SPEAKER_00]: that is formed into value-added products
like hot sauces and pepper-infused honey
[SPEAKER_00]: and interesting products like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, space is a challenge within CEA
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of space is a high barrier of
entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulation and building codes,
kind of understanding what's permissible
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funds, so within soil-based operations,
oftentimes operating on limited funds,
[SPEAKER_00]: this leads to low salaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of living is really high in New
York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes this also leads to farm
manager turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it difficult for us too,
because within one season there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: two farm managers at a site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's that kind of differentiates
or like extension work in the city versus
[SPEAKER_00]: in a rural context where if we were
upstate, we'd be primarily working with
[SPEAKER_00]: farm owners and building that relationship
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the farm manager turnover,
there's also loss of institutional
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and kind of have to start over
all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it difficult for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm sure for the organizations as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also leads to difficulty in investing
in infrastructure and just sort of scaling
[SPEAKER_00]: up the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the youth farm in
Brooklyn, and they're actually using the
[SPEAKER_00]: front space of a high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funds is, like I mentioned, within the CEA
operations as a high startup cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to enter the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The returns may be too little or too late
in terms of some of the investments that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been made by venture capitalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the third main category of
challenges in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of two backgrounds and
mindsets of gardening versus production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a steep learning curve in
terms of what you need to know to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell to a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes there's just a gap in
knowledge about efficiency and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of lacking with gardeners
that come into this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just learning technical skills on
the fly and just having a general sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: the technical production knowledge that's
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beekeeping workshop in the
Bronx.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a group called CRAFT in New York
City, and CRAFT stands for Collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional Alliance for Farmer Training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one way that farmers are sort
of getting this technical knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing peer-to-peer learning and learning
from other operations in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, knowledge within CEA
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sort of a lack of information
sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this fear of, within tech
growers, that they're sort of reinventing
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from having a proprietary
mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these companies are really tech
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just come at it from a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes this results in a lack of
experienced growers and decision-making
[SPEAKER_00]: roles, folks that have a lot of that
experience managing larger scale
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest and disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least in New York City, some of the
most common insect pests that we saw were
[SPEAKER_00]: flea beetles and harlequin bugs on
brassicas, the two-spotted spider mite on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes and other crops, as well as
foliar diseases, bacterial spot on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, and bacterial speck on tomatoes,
and bacterial spot on peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, in the city, there's a big
focus on organic controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of follows in line with the
values of the mission of a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tend to be more organic than
conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a harlequin bug on broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also just shows the differences
with upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: With upstate and downstate, some of the
pest and disease pressures are different
[SPEAKER_00]: given the warmer climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we're taking on both shared and
individual projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So providing individual TA technical
assistance to urban growers, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: through email, but other times through
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big platform for us is Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that that's where we're able to do
the most outreach to our target audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also focusing on production-oriented
workshops and small group learning as we
[SPEAKER_00]: head into the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of the downtime for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're entering that grower meeting season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking on food safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some CEA controlled environment
agriculture operations are focusing on GAP
[SPEAKER_00]: certification so that they can enter new
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam is going to continue his work on soil
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this photo right here is Betzdi
Campaign Against Hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their Saratoga farm in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of on-site TA,
so us going out and helping farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: individually in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next steps, a few upcoming projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of a mushroom workshop
at La Finca del Sur in the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm continuing work on specialty mushroom
production in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've applied to a couple federal grants
to create a network of mushroom educators
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also trying to connect CEA growers,
sort of fostering more collaboration and
[SPEAKER_00]: network sharing amongst this group that
tends to be proprietary-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is done through meetups and
roundtables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also trying to find more sites for
research and field trials, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: developing a newsletter where we can sort
of continue to do this outreach to our
[SPEAKER_00]: network and our target audience of
commercial growers in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is our Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 500 followers right now in
our email addresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was about markets and the
different marketing outlets that these
[SPEAKER_00]: operations sell into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really varies from operation to
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brooklyn Grain has a farm stand,
like on the weekends, and so folks come up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rooftop and buy their produce
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big that CSA is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell to a company called Local
Roots NYC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an online CSA website and online
buying platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it's an online CSA website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their third site in Sunset Park,
a school knew that they were opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they asked them to start a CSA for
the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just sort of with that brand
recognition and the publicity that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get around being in a city, sometimes
folks come to them for a CSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like a lot of other things,
or like the sort of general theme of these
[SPEAKER_04]: urban agriculture in New York,
is no two operations being the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are all these sort of
creative marketing approaches people are
[SPEAKER_04]: taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Gotham Greens, that we pointed out
before, is on top of the Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just walk it down into the Whole
Foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most places obviously don't have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: More often, it'll be on-site farm stands.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the nonprofits sell that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the nonprofits have CSAs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of times, that's partly
just because it's a way of engaging the
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily the most profitable
way to get rid of stuff, because now
[SPEAKER_04]: you're growing all this squash and stuff
that takes up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gets people engaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't see a lot of urban growers
at green markets actually, probably
[SPEAKER_04]: because of scale in a lot of cases,
or because they already have their markets
[SPEAKER_04]: pinned down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The higher end places are selling directly
to restaurants a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Gotham Greens, or like Broken Grange,
I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a huge market in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: The chefs like to buy directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to say you bought from somebody
down the street, when local is a big
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, that's hyper-local.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only one who gets to say that
you bought stuff in from somebody in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same borough that you're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some restaurants have gardens on their
rooftops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple of them have sort of like a
market garden on their rooftop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't worked with them as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restaurants, I mentioned that one,
but restaurants make up a huge portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sales a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the advantage is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we sort of touched a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it is just sort of like
this cool factor, and it's novel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can kind of play up on that in
terms of in a marketing sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just local, it's hyper-local.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage is that it also allows
people to sort of learn more about where
[SPEAKER_00]: their food comes from, how it's grown,
and really engage with the food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of these farms, I guess you
wouldn't probably say that somebody went
[SPEAKER_04]: to New York City in order to start a farm
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe with some of the indoor or some of
the startups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that case, it's probably about
being close to talent or having,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, about the people that they're
hiring, and that's where those people want
[SPEAKER_04]: to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for a lot of the projects,
it's that people, this is where they were
[SPEAKER_04]: already living.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a city of eight and a half million
people, it's hard to find a way to sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of, you know, if you want to get out and
get your hands dirty, it can be tricky to
[SPEAKER_04]: find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are community gardens,
but a lot of it seems like it's people who
[SPEAKER_04]: already live there and want to do
something, but they don't want to move out
[SPEAKER_04]: of the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they figure out how to farm in the
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a place that you would probably
travel from far and wide because it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: best place to farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like it's got a lot,
obviously a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of all these operations, do any of them
actually own either the rooftop or the
[SPEAKER_03]: land they were farming on, or are most of
them renting from whoever owns these
[SPEAKER_03]: properties?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, with a lot of these
operations, if there are any farm owners,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are they primarily renting or leasing
the space, primarily renting or leasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the space, they work out some sort of
contract or negotiation with the building
[SPEAKER_00]: owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that arrangement looks different with
every operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a hydroponic facility on top of
an affordable housing unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A building owner, in the case of Gotham
Greens, is Whole Foods, so they have their
[SPEAKER_00]: own relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hellgate Farm, that photo that I mentioned
where they're growing peppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot peppers, that's like it was like
through a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of other arrangements.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to think of any case where the
operator owns the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Land is just really expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure mathematically you can
make it work as a business if you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: purchase the property first, except maybe
there might be some areas around the
[SPEAKER_04]: fringes or something, unless there's some
sort of support for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something we've talked about a
little bit with some people, this idea of
[SPEAKER_04]: what would ag preservation restrictions
look like in New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm chuckling, but it's a real question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there is something around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there could be something that looks
like purchasing development rights or
[SPEAKER_04]: something that makes an incentive to
actually farm somewhere and maybe even own
[SPEAKER_04]: the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as it is, ideally, long term lease
arrangements is the best that most people
[SPEAKER_04]: can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's mostly what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a lot of it is on parks land.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the most common land owner
for these operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the community gardens very often
are on parks land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Thumb is part of parks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, parks own some properties that
were sort of grandfathered into the Green
[SPEAKER_04]: Thumb program that were bigger and that
are community farms or nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a couple of examples of
for-profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farms that are on parks land as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I was just going to make a
comment about rooftop farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the example that I gave about Brooklyn
Grange, Ben Flaner, the director of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture there and the co-founder,
he did a lot of cold calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sort of focused on areas that would
be able to have the adequate weight
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he focused first at a location in Long
Island City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one was in the Navy
Yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focusing on buildings that can
withstand that kind of load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really just cold calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no directory to really go off of.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you have any
collaborations with some other
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, I've seen the USDA
bringing in farms and things in Harlem and
[SPEAKER_03]: other food insecure programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So USDA helping you guys out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how about some of the botanical
gardens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else helping you out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were part of the 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they were included in the
25, but we definitely did visit a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't mention this, but we are
co-located with the USDA and Ag and
[SPEAKER_00]: Markets on the same floor in our building
at 55 Hanson in Fort Greene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to think of specific
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably so many right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our time is talking with
stakeholders all over the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very often, I mean, you're
mentioning like work in food insecure
[SPEAKER_04]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very often it's justice oriented or
social justice, racial justice,
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of all combined into food justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's maybe one of the biggest umbrellas
of the different organizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with, and I know there are
probably at least 20 that we could rattle
[SPEAKER_04]: off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also other farmer support
that was in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's community garden support,
Green Thumb being the biggest player
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're mostly sort of letting them do
that because like we said, there are
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of community gardens and there
are two of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be pretty tough for us to keep up
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Green Thumb sort of has it covered
anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also Grow NYC, which is a city
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a program called Farm Roots,
which is a farmer training initiative that
[SPEAKER_04]: they've had for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a program called the Farm
School, which is another sort of urban
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer training program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those are both sort of in place run
as non-profits or city programs for farmer
[SPEAKER_04]: training.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a big city that there's room.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of room for more players.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of what we've been doing in
working with a lot of these stakeholders
[SPEAKER_04]: is figuring out how we can support them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that as we enter the space where a lot
of people have already been, a lot of our
[SPEAKER_04]: role right now is support for all sorts of
other groups, figuring out how we can
[SPEAKER_04]: support other groups rather than trying to
do what they're already doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry, the USDA is still helping
you and the Tannic and Gardens are still
[SPEAKER_03]: involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've been working with some
botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they sort of have their own
gardening.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're another place that works more with
gardeners, I guess, than farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've definitely been visiting them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have people we work with there.
[SPEAKER_04]: USDA, I guess, less directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have a USDA FSA rep on our floor
who works with a lot of the same people
[SPEAKER_04]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do collaborate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was what the mission is of
these mission-based groups, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's, what were the examples that
you were saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said if it's just about bringing local
produce or local training to people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: city or if an extent beyond that to who
they're hiring and specific communities
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it is, so one of the big missions
is food access, is growing food to either
[SPEAKER_04]: just to be donated or to be sold at a
lower price than you'd normally find it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also to grow culturally appropriate
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where like amaranth and bitter
melon and things like that come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that's hard to find at the grocery
store that the surrounding community
[SPEAKER_04]: really would like to have and has been
asking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, amaranth is a really popular
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So food access being one part of it,
access to healthy food.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that is educational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the other sort of overlapping
big mission is education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of youth programming,
a lot of summer programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, summer obviously lines up nicely
with the growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of summer programming on
a lot of these farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say probably most of the
nonprofits have some sort of summer youth
[SPEAKER_04]: programming where kids, high schoolers or
younger are there, you know, working on
[SPEAKER_04]: the farm every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still a lot of overlap between the
different missions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's sort of general missions of
empowerment, of empowering the local
[SPEAKER_04]: community and providing green space and
providing a public space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Providing gathering places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like two examples that come to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the nonprofit sister organization
of Brooklyn Grange is called City Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they host educational tours for
school-aged children to come primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: from low-income public housing
neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randall's Island Inbred Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're located close to Harlem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they focus their education on
educational tours and their mission is
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach to that community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you mentioned workforce development,
and that is one as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right next to Randall's Island Urban Farm
is Project Eats, Ward's Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a lot of sort of job training
programs for returning citizens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like a culinary program there
on the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And men who've recently incarcerated men
will come and a couple days a week will
[SPEAKER_04]: come and do job training stuff there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hannah?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to hear these updates on
campus, so thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the topic of contaminants,
do you have data on the growers that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've worked with, how many of them have
actively tested their soils or if
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminants, especially heavy metals,
are something that they're actively
[SPEAKER_03]: troubleshooting versus something that's
well-managed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that we have hard numbers
on that, but we do ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we sort of bring up this question
of have you tested your soil, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that they think of is they're
thinking a test for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not thinking about nutrients at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's very much on
the forefront of their minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say most of the operations
have tested their soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know exactly how many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The common approach is to assume that your
soil is contaminated and to just bring it
[SPEAKER_04]: right off the bat, maybe put down
landscape fabric and bring in soil on top
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the most common approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of the community garden
approach or the green thumb general
[SPEAKER_04]: approach now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think since they're so intertwined,
especially with a lot of the nonprofit
[SPEAKER_04]: farms, that people replicate that as a
best practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's a big sort of
ever-present question for all the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: waste folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a follow-up to that,
are you finding that access to resources
[SPEAKER_03]: like clean soil and compost is an issue
for your growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they starting to find the materials
that they need and successfully getting
[SPEAKER_03]: them and growing them?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good lead-in to a project that
we're starting to connect with.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so first, the question if they're
having trouble accessing stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: accessing growing medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, I think that's why people grow
in 100% compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they can get it for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city can drop it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it might not be dropped off when
they want it, but they get it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's free.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have to pay hundreds of
thousands of dollars to have it delivered
[SPEAKER_04]: in from a nursery out of the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a matter of just having the
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a project that's being started
up called the, well, it's called Pure Soil
[SPEAKER_04]: NYC, but built on what's called the Clean
Soil Bank that already exists in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, is there a slide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was early on when we talked about
manual labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we were working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what this is, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a test site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So OK, I'll back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Clean Soil Bank is a project that sort
of already existed in the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was being rolled out, which wasn't for
growing space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just for clean fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea being that if the top soil,
if you assume that the top, however many
[SPEAKER_04]: feet are contaminated, that below that,
because lead especially isn't that mobile
[SPEAKER_04]: in the soil, that if you go deep enough,
it's not going to be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's clean in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for people who needed to build a berm
in front by the ocean or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: who needed fill material that they knew
was free of contaminants, then they would
[SPEAKER_04]: get stuff being dug up from a foundation
of a construction site, which is obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: happening all the time around the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all this clean fill being dug up
and being hauled out of the city and
[SPEAKER_04]: dumped in somewhere in New Jersey
probably, we assume.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where most of the stuff gets
dumped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just gets trucked out of the
city and then trucked back in for people
[SPEAKER_04]: who need fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were setting up this bank to
connect them directly so that it would go
[SPEAKER_04]: directly from one site to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not much use for gardeners because
that soil is totally free of organic
[SPEAKER_04]: matter, basically, and lifeless,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the idea for Pure Soil NYC that the
Governor's Office of Environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: Remediation is putting together is to take
that soil, take the best that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: find of that soil, not exactly sure how
that's figured, and mix it with compost
[SPEAKER_04]: and then deliver that for growing in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're helping to mix the clean fill.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, a pile of the fill with
compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so somebody that we've worked with a
little bit in the cities was doing this
[SPEAKER_04]: trial, trying like 0% compost,
10%, 20%, 30%, and growing stuff in and
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you definitely can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: 0% does not work very well, although a
little bit better than you would expect,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so finding that sweet spot of what's
the ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the compost and the fill are
not uniform around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sources are not going to be uniform,
so it's all going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: approximate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been finding ways to work with
them, and we're talking about maybe some
[SPEAKER_04]: field trials to figure out how to make use
of that soil and how can you make that
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to come in and say,
don't do it, because they're going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to come in and figure out how we
can help make it work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your map of locations seem to have a
cluster on the Lower East Side.
Oh, yeah.
I wonder if you could talk about what that
is.
And you sort of spoke about places being
located near cultural communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you could talk about the built
environment or constraints, the shade play
[SPEAKER_03]: factor, subway lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things of that nature and where these are
actually located.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of community gardens or the
commercial operations or both?
[SPEAKER_03]: Both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just why is so much of Brooklyn
kind of a desert, and there's so many on
[SPEAKER_03]: the North Side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any patterns that you could
describe?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for community gardens, well,
so that big empty area in southern
[SPEAKER_04]: Brooklyn is more sort of yards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've been wondering the same
thing to a certain extent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just looking at it now,
like Bay Ridge, Ute Bay, it tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more residential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think that there would be
more urban ag happening in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the clusters in the Bronx, Harlem,
and central and eastern Brooklyn
[SPEAKER_04]: correspond very closely with the earlier
crazy colored map that those are
[SPEAKER_04]: historically black communities that were
present day and historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of work has been focused
there because those are areas that had
[SPEAKER_04]: been systematically underserved for
decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now that's one thing is that that
people sort of in some cases pushing back
[SPEAKER_04]: against development and gentrification is
a huge other huge factor in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: places that have gone into neighborhoods
where people had started up their own
[SPEAKER_04]: community gardens in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Bronx definitely, but also in
Brooklyn, people had started up their own
[SPEAKER_04]: community gardens and just vacant lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then developers that started to make
the surrounding community more desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And developers started to want to move in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the open spot is the
garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's one of the ways that the
community garden movement has played a
[SPEAKER_04]: really big role in the city is in
basically just fighting developers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been fighting against developers
for 40 or 50 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that's sort of a long,
long way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about historically
community gardens were sort of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction of the economic crisis happening
in the eighties in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times it was just,
it was survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trying to have some open space so
that you can grow your own produce and
[SPEAKER_00]: just be able to survive in really
difficult times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have time for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like to ask, what are your
hopes for Urban Ag in New York City in the
[SPEAKER_03]: next five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can continue that over lunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something that comes to mind,
there's a lot of work right now happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in the policy realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would hope to see, at least for me,
and maybe I could speak for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is bridging this divide between soil-based
groups and CEA-controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there tends to be this divide where
mission-driven versus profit-driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been at times contentious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would like to see within the next
five years those groups working with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another and collaborating and not being so
divided.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something we started noticing
before we even started our job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a constant presence in our
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe just a sort of stability,
I guess, in something that would give,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this also would go to policy,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're talking about hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Community gardens have this challenge,
but a lot of the soil-based farms as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: like just tenure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you don't own the land,
a sort of tenuous situation can exist
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, just the funding
challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the mission-driven farms,
funding is a challenge in almost every
[SPEAKER_04]: case, if not every single case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if there's maybe a more secure
funding stream or something, and we look
[SPEAKER_04]: for how we can help all these projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's for profit, we're trying to
help the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times that's sort of an easy way
for us to focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the nonprofits, I'm talking about
it more because it's a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're just trying to figure out

[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: My hope in five years is to have answers
to all the questions I just asked.
