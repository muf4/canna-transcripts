[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Amara Dunsilver is the biocontrol
specialist with the New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated Pest Management Program,
which is part of Cornell's College of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and Life Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this position, she supports the
effective use of biological control
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions for pests in all agricultural
commodities, as well as pests encountered
[SPEAKER_00]: by all New Yorkers where they live,
work, play, and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she's not at work, she's enjoying she
enjoys watching all the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to her flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Amara.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to let folks know when I start
my talk that I consider myself based on
[SPEAKER_03]: what you may have heard in biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend a lot of time thinking about
biocontrol, and aging with biocontrol,
[SPEAKER_03]: and reading about biocontrol, and making
the scientific words for biocontrol,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't learn in years about
biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because I cover all of the
agricultural commodities I am not an
[SPEAKER_03]: expert in biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something I work in exclusively
the way some of you are supposed to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm expecting others to think about it
each day as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to start out with a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question for you is, are you using
biocontrol to nap?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the options in a moment are going to
ask you to raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Options are yes, no, or I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure it's a perfectly
reasonable answer because my title was
[SPEAKER_03]: biocontrol, biopesticide, biostabilism,
oh my, what are these terms even mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many people are using biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many feel like, no, I'm not using
biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many are not sure if you're using
biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, a lot of folks are just worn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is later in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been gray for months here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here's what we're going to
talk about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start by going over these
terms, the three big bio terms,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do they mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to chat a little bit about
ways you might be using biocontrol,
[SPEAKER_03]: so even if you're not sure which you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to set you up with a
little bit of information about
[SPEAKER_03]: autostimulant and autostimulation already
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to be interrupted.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you raise your hand, that's probably
better than just showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will ask you to raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just did it a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so these bioterms, biocontrol,
biopastaside, biosimulant, what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do all of these mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why do you hate them?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you don't care?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into that, I'd like to
define a few terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not trained as an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're being entomologist,
how can you know that insects are not the
[SPEAKER_03]: same as mice, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll use the word, et cetera,
where I'll be hearing all groups of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't technically insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mice that are erected.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll also use the word micro, which just
means bacteria, fungi, viruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pathogens are microbes that cause disease
on plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about human pathogens
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no expertise there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll use the term pest to refer
to both insects and plant pathogens that
[SPEAKER_03]: are causing it with sugar crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So biocontrol is just using something
living or something that a living thing
[SPEAKER_03]: produces to control pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lady beetles and avids are a really
acceptable example that most people are
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lady beetle or the lady bug is the
natural enemy, or the biocontrol agent is
[SPEAKER_03]: the pest or the avid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But biocontrol is a whole lot more than
just insects doing biological control,
[SPEAKER_03]: or insects being controlled by
biopastasides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what biopastasides mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biopastasides are pesticides, and their
active ingredients can be plant extracts,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can be microbes, or they can be
something like potassium and biofarmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like are either pesticides, they can
control pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be important in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in contrast to biopastasides,
which can control pests, biostimulants
[SPEAKER_03]: grow healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may contain similar things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biostimulants are often made from plants
or TV extracts, micro-organisms,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some natural compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the active ingredients may be very
similar, but they have the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: If biopastasides are for controlling
pests, biostimulants are for growing
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biostimulants are not currently registered
with the EPA or your state DEC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might change in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even have a firm, established
definition for biopastasides yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some definitions that are being
promoted and out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it does get a little bit
complicated with biopastasides and
[SPEAKER_03]: biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It offers protection against a variety of
fungal pathogens, and it actively blocks
[SPEAKER_03]: the entry of those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a biopastaside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can control the pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lists some diseases against which it's
particularly effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in the absence of these diseases,
it will stimulate the plant's natural
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance mechanisms, or suppresses those
diseases and stimulates the plant's
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it explicitly says it's a
biostimulant, and it will aid you across
[SPEAKER_03]: even if there are no diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I looked at the NYCAD, which is the
go-to place for is the pesticide
[SPEAKER_03]: registered for use in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not listed there, which either means
that the pesticide has not registered in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, or it's not a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a strain of this fungus that's
registered with the EPA, or it was back in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is confusing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not the only product out there
that is confusing, but it has kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to acknowledge that there
is some complexity there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have this disclaimer, because I'm a
renowned university employee, I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that I tell you that if you're
using a product that's not labeled and
[SPEAKER_03]: registered as a pesticide, and in New York
State not labeled and registered on the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop or the pest, that's an awful little
pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never recommend awful little
pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are not already familiar with the
Cornell Pesticide Safety Education
[SPEAKER_03]: Program, which is a part of the New York
State Academy Program, they're a great
[SPEAKER_03]: resource if you have questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy a new product, and you're
interested in buying it, and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: confused, is it a pesticide, is it not a
pesticide, what are the advantages of my
[SPEAKER_03]: farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not regulatory, they're great at
answering questions, they can pass
[SPEAKER_03]: questions anonymously to your state DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to connect you with them if
you would like to get us more information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're looking at a product and
you're wondering, is it a biopesticide,
[SPEAKER_03]: it includes, first of all, a pesticide
role.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a permanent pesticide role,
it includes a biopesticide as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_03]: biosignorance.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we think about the active ingredients
that are in biopesticides, the
[SPEAKER_03]: microorganisms and the plant names are
pretty easy to recognize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't always tell when I look at the
name of the chemical if it's a natural
[SPEAKER_03]: biochemical or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an official list with the EPA of
which things are considered biopesticides,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the microbes and the plant extracts
are pretty easy to recognize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The EPA registration number is another
really important clue because if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide, it'll have a registration
number.
[SPEAKER_03]: With one exception, which is why I took a
pesticide here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So minimum risk pesticides don't have EPA
registration numbers, so there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific list of active ingredients that
are permitted in minimum risk pesticides A
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these are also plant extracts,
which is confusing to you already because
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these plant extracts are
registered as pesticides, sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: they're minimum risk pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thyme, oil, citric acid, and the other two
examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not currently registered in the
EPA or in your state of the EC,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they won't have EPA registration
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they're not registered,
they haven't gone through that same
[SPEAKER_03]: process of evaluation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the label will have a statement
like you see up here that says they're
[SPEAKER_03]: exempt under section 25B of IFRA,
so some people call them 25B process,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the label doesn't have to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a great page about minimum risk
pesticides in the New York State FPM,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I sent Kristen a little bit of links
that she'll share with folks afterwards
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can read more about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll mention this at the end too,
but if there's anyone here who needs hard
[SPEAKER_03]: copies instead of accessing something
online, I'll share my office phone number
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end or come see me, I'll be happy
to make sure we get hard copies too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an important question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you care if it's a bio pesticide or
not?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another reasonable question.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of whether it's a bio pesticide
or a bio stimulant, I think this is really
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant in terms of laws about pesticide
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe different states, Ohio versus
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of whether it's a bio pesticide
versus if it's an organic approved but not
[SPEAKER_03]: bio pesticide, that may not be as
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's approved for use in organic
production may be a more important
[SPEAKER_03]: question, so I just wanted to acknowledge
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this is semantics, but people want
to know what is the bio pesticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions before we move on about bio
controls, bio pesticide biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you might be using bio controls
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about three areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conserving, releasing, and spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we don't talk about much in
organic, but I think it's something we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think you're already using bio
control currently, and I didn't see it in
[SPEAKER_03]: your hands, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've raised pretty high organic
apples, and so I'm using a whole wrap of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything from passive bicarbonate to to
bio-series, to very bassiana, and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: just a whole mess of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, one of the things that I was
going to say was the big problem is that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't oftentimes believe that what the
label says or what the manufacturer says
[SPEAKER_02]: on their website is by others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we can find out about whether
some of these things really work or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better off it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in case you didn't hear, sharing that
you use a lot of different bio-pesticides
[SPEAKER_03]: in organic apple production, and also the
importance of knowing whether these
[SPEAKER_03]: bio-pesticides work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to address that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not as much as we want,
but I have not done and have not read as
[SPEAKER_03]: many trials as I wish were out there in
Gale Crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else want to share bio-control
series?
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, that's the first one we're
going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So conserving insect natural enemies by
creating habitat for them or just
[SPEAKER_03]: protecting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So insects, insect natural enemies that
are going to help with pest control need
[SPEAKER_03]: to say things that are really living
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need food, they need shelter,
and they need protection from harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a great opportunity for
concentration bio-control in the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: setting is you're already not using a lot
of the chemicals that conventional farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: are using.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are killing some of their natural
enemies and so contributing to pest
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a great opportunity in
organic production.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can fit well in the system in that you
are, the organic pesticides that are
[SPEAKER_03]: approved for use in organic agriculture
are often going to have lower impacts on
[SPEAKER_03]: these natural enemies that are going to be
helping pest control.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least in the past, there has also been
some funding now through your local NRCS
[SPEAKER_03]: offices to help you establish available
wildflowers that will help feed insects
[SPEAKER_03]: that help with pest control.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea if that is going to be
available in the future, but we encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: you to reach out to your local NRCS office
about something that's of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some challenges and this I think
is a challenge really across agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: is wanting to have formula.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to, you know, tell me which
flowers to plant, what area, how it goes
[SPEAKER_03]: into my crop, so that I will control my
pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's very, very key situations
where we have a good formula of this is
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly how we need to provide habitat for
innocent natural enemies in order to get
[SPEAKER_03]: past it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few examples, but not too many
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing I wanted to point
out was that just because something is
[SPEAKER_03]: organic approved does not mean it's going
to not kill any of our crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were probably aware of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a whole talk about
conservation of wild control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some more resources in the
weeks that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is specifically about what you were
just talking about, but I just thought of
[SPEAKER_01]: a pheromone trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use pheromone traps to capture Indian
meal moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does that fit in your, is that in
bio control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would you fit in a pheromone trap?
[SPEAKER_03]: So according to EPA pheromone traps,
pheromones are biopassified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pheromone itself doesn't kill the
insect, pulling the insect in to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: caught on a sticky tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with the definition of
apassified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for example, the repellents
also apassified, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not killing the insect,
they're repalling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But pheromones are biopassified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a Venn diagram that I didn't
show here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wild controls would include insects and
nematodes that kill pests and microbes
[SPEAKER_03]: that kill pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regular acres have decided that if
it's a micro, a plant extract,
[SPEAKER_03]: or a biochemical, it's a biopassified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insects and nematodes are exempt from
being regulated under a different type of
[SPEAKER_03]: size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they also act as biopass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some of the semantics, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example of a biocontrol agent
you might be considering as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in field crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tiny ferrous toy wasp that
attacks your leaf beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was introduced to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be found in New York, but I'm told
that it can be a little bit sporadic in
[SPEAKER_03]: its populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot buy it commercially right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting thing about the wasp is
that it's going to, this activity in this
[SPEAKER_03]: season, 2025, is going to impact the
serially beetle population in 2026.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a situation which I think is
pretty common thing in organic production
[SPEAKER_03]: where you are thinking about the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're doing things this year
that are going to impact years down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road your house population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the ways you can serve it is
you're reducing pesticide use and creating
[SPEAKER_03]: some barriers in a farm where you're not
using pesticides, which again,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is a great opportunity to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we talked about conserving,
releasing live biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's three, these again,
these would be live biocontrol agents that
[SPEAKER_03]: are not biopassive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have predators, an insect eating
another insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lady beetle picture here,
just sort of a record.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say I don't encourage
releasing lady beetles out into the field
[SPEAKER_03]: because I feel like conserving them,
bringing them in from other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have parasitoids, like that tiny wasp I
just showed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're laying eggs in or on the pests
that will eat the pests from the inside
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have entopathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some nematodes are pests on plants,
others eat insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these tiny nematodes collaborate with
the bacteria that is inside the nematode.
[SPEAKER_03]: They invade the insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together with the bacteria, they kill the
insect, reproduce.
[SPEAKER_03]: The insect gets full of more tiny
nematodes and then they go out into the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and find more insects to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: An example of releasing biocontrol agents
would be entopathic nematodes for
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled alfalfa and alfetino.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I know is being
used extensively, at least in northern New
[SPEAKER_03]: York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have really good luck controlling
alfalfa and alfetino this way,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially because it turns out that you
can apply this mixture of nematodes that
[SPEAKER_03]: were first isolated from New York soil by
balsam shields that are brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go first into the soil to
make one application, and you're good to
[SPEAKER_03]: go, which is pretty unusual for
biocontrols.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some evidence that these
nematodes can also feed on other
[SPEAKER_03]: soil-dwelling insects, and there's ongoing
research to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there's some evidence that
this can help you with foreign root words,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we don't know as much about those
contacts yet as we do about alfalfa and
[SPEAKER_03]: alfetino.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be, again, a link in the
resources that you're getting after the
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting if you want to read more about
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the realm of releasing biocontrol
agents, I want to mention a resource from
[SPEAKER_03]: the New York State Integrated Balsam
Management Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are collecting a growing list of
profiles on biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a picture of a page that's about
tetra-psychiatry was, the serolepial
[SPEAKER_03]: parasitoide.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal with these profiles is you try to
get practical information distilled into
[SPEAKER_03]: small chunks, so you get quick answers to
the questions, does it work, where do I
[SPEAKER_03]: use it, can I buy it, and those sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a QR code here, but there's
also a little link that'll be coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: in the resources as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about conserving,
we talked about releasing, and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad somebody mentioned using some of
the biopastasides and putter crops at
[SPEAKER_03]: least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So spraying biopastasides can sometimes
feel a little bit like spreading
[SPEAKER_03]: radio-pastasides.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a sprayer, but there's some
nuances to it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we discussed before, biopastasides,
we may need to move back to ingredients,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant extracts, microbes, and
biochemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are still pesticides, which means
that all of these things that you might
[SPEAKER_03]: think about if you're using a
non-biopastaside apply to them as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So reading the label is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have restricted entry intervals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are often shorter than a
non-biological or conventional pesticide,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they are fully on the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them are approved for use during
infraction, but not all of them are,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's an important thing to check.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will have information on the label
about PPE that you have to wear when you
[SPEAKER_03]: apply them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the bottom of the slide,
I wanted to point out that not all
[SPEAKER_03]: biopastasides are completely safe for all
insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is from a biopastaside label,
and it notes that if you have direct
[SPEAKER_03]: contact with a biopastaside in bees,
you can harm bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tells you not to spray this when
bees are harming the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, really important to read the
label, just because it had a bio in the
[SPEAKER_03]: name doesn't mean it's zero risk and it
harms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of the biopastasides, are there any of
them who would like restricted use where
[SPEAKER_02]: they require a DPC sprayer license?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not aware of any biopastasides that
are restricted use in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: please.
[SPEAKER_03]: The example I'm thinking of is there's a
biopastaside group I love that you might
[SPEAKER_03]: need a license to be able to buy the
product, but that's not valid to this
[SPEAKER_03]: audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because there's such a big group,
you would want to look at the product
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using and whether it harms the
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the biopastasides action are
very similar to a non-biopastaside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's something extracted from a
plant or something produced by a microbe
[SPEAKER_03]: or the microbe itself, you spray it on the
insect, you spray it on the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pretty familiar with the
biopastasides working that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The picture on the right with the two
yellow moths and no lugs in the air,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is an example, this is my depiction
of a pheromone, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's how pheromones work,
they're mimicking the chemical that
[SPEAKER_03]: insects produce to find mates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're disrupting that when you're
using pheromones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the insect bio-insecticide mode of
action are also similar to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: non-biological insecticide mode of action.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, you can have
bio-insecticides that are going to stop
[SPEAKER_03]: insects from growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insects are regulators, that's a thing
that is available in non-biological
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have repellents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some of the biopastasides will
stop the insect from eating days before
[SPEAKER_03]: the insect actually dies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that you see in the
biopastasides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some mode of action that
are maybe different from, more different
[SPEAKER_03]: from the non-biological pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to call this one over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fungus that eats the sclerotia of
white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have one fungus eating another
fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some biopastasides are formulated with
living microorganisms that grow over the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface of the plant, whether it's a leaf
or a fruit or flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they take up so much space on the
plant tissue that the pathogens can't find
[SPEAKER_03]: a place in the land and start growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some biopastasides and
some non-biological pesticides,
[SPEAKER_03]: too, that will activate the plant's
defense, which is what I have intended to
[SPEAKER_03]: show here with lighting bolts coming out
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're priming the plant by exposing it
to the biopastasides and turning on its
[SPEAKER_03]: defenses early so when the pests show up,
the plant's better be able to defend
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this mode of action is
complicated because we talked before about
[SPEAKER_03]: how biopastasides and bio-stimulants grow
healthy plants and biopastasides grow
[SPEAKER_03]: pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some biopastasides work by growing
stronger, healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the label will actually say,
this biopastasides controls this pest
[SPEAKER_03]: because it grows stronger plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's confusing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because biopastasides also grow stronger
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really just comes down to the stated
purpose on the label and how the
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturer has chosen to register or not
register that product and the claims that
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more resources available on
biopastaside mode of action.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have two blog posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that focuses on biopastasides to plant
visas.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that focuses on biopastasides for
insect pests and those links to the
[SPEAKER_03]: research as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to share our copies of any
one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you care about the active
ingredients of the biopastaside or the
[SPEAKER_03]: mode of action?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really important implications for
how these products work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, when you might want to use
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are trying to stimulate your plant
defenses and mask how the biopastaside
[SPEAKER_03]: works, you have to get it on in enough
time before the pest shows up that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: have that defense activation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's important because there's
implications for what success looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if the biopastaside is
going to stop insect eating, but the
[SPEAKER_03]: insects might not die for three to seven
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go out into the field two days
later and your insects aren't dead,
[SPEAKER_03]: did it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it not work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing how a product works can tell
you how to use it so that you're most
[SPEAKER_03]: likely to see results and also what
success might look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then knowing whether the active
ingredient in the biopastaside is alive is
[SPEAKER_03]: really important because there's some
important implications for how long it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to last.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much product are you buying?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long can you keep it in force in a
certain use of efficacy?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you should store it?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some biopastasides that are
actually supposed to be stored either in a
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerator or freezer, which is an
important thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, make sure this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But technically, if it's stored in a
refrigerator or freezer, it should be a
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerator or freezer that's home to use
for pesticides, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're not storing pesticides with
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often does that happen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So just being aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want to spend a lot of money
on a product, store it improperly,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then add them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing that ahead of time is
important, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure on shipping, they went to ship
and it's still under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still hasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the shipping as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when folks, so releasing insect
biopatrol agents is really common in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's often recommended when you're
buying insects coming to check the
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature of the box, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To make sure that they didn't go out of
range and ship it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also with the live microbes,
there's some implications for the optimal
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions when you're doing an
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's the pH of the tank,
or the time of day, or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had more of these made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have 11 so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started putting together these
biotesticide profiles because there are a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of details about wild pesticides that
can make a big difference if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about using the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like in-shelf life, how you should
store it, how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, how does it do when you need it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long is it going to be able to
withstand sunlight outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an optimal temperature range to
use it?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not meant to replace a label,
obviously, but the goal was to get some of
[SPEAKER_03]: that practical information in one place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you as a grower are tracking down
EPA registration documents and brochures
[SPEAKER_03]: from the manufacturer and the product
label when you're trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_03]: to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there'll be links to these as well in
the emails coming from the president and I
[SPEAKER_03]: can get you to our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do biotesticides work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have a great answer for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had a much better answer for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to explain to you why I
don't have a better answer for you and why
[SPEAKER_03]: it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that I spend a lot of time on
is I look through replicated research
[SPEAKER_03]: trials to collect efficacy data on
biotesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to rotate through all the crops,
which means at the moment the field crops
[SPEAKER_03]: spreadsheet is a couple years old,
on the list for this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did do a quick search to see what I
could find about some things like Q-Zero
[SPEAKER_03]: in the headlights or potentially C-Pass in
corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I don't have, there was time to
jump out and be like, wow, this 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: works, you should definitely try this
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am collecting this information so
that it is more available and easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: find later.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be links to them as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, this is a few years out of
date, but I work on keeping them updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not nearly as many trials in
field crops or biotesticides as there are
[SPEAKER_03]: in fruit and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did find this article, which was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a meta-analysis of 56 studies
focusing on Q-Zero in the headlight elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were, the studies were all
looking at microbial biophysical agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things that could be in biotesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I will say none of these studies
were actually looking at formulated
[SPEAKER_03]: biotesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a big difference sometimes
between a researcher making some microbe
[SPEAKER_03]: and applying it in a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result, first what happens if
that microbe actually makes it to be
[SPEAKER_03]: formulated and commercially available.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, this paper, the goal was
to look at overall patterns and efficacy
[SPEAKER_03]: of all of these microbial biophysicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it wasn't like this microbial
biophysical agent, that would be worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in looking through the list of
microbes they looked at, very few of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones they looked at are commercially
available right now, as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is unfortunate and a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the piece of science well over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were some interesting patterns
in this review.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at this chart here,
this middle line is no different from
[SPEAKER_03]: doing nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in general, overall, the biocontrol
agents did tend to reduce disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at all those studies together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They maybe had a slight impact on the
yield, and I know there were several other
[SPEAKER_03]: studies here today that showed some
changes in pest pressure or some changes
[SPEAKER_03]: in pest control.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them also reduced toxins,
mostly what they looked at was non-toxins
[SPEAKER_03]: in these studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was also really complicated,
and this is a thing that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about biocontrols and
biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, they looked at studies
that compared, we called for that were
[SPEAKER_03]: very susceptible to these antibiotics,
and we called for that were less
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they found that the biocontrol agents,
the biopesticide active ingredients,
[SPEAKER_03]: reduced disease and increased yield more
in the highly susceptible varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you got better non-toxin reduction in
the less susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's confusingly complicated,
and that's what they found.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also found some interesting
differences, and again, it's complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of when you apply the microbial
biocontrol agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each microbial biocontrol agent is
going to do different things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So each one, maybe it is better applied to
seed, or maybe it is better applied to the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual weed head.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found that in general, when you make
the application at the thesis compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: a seed treatment, you lose the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you apply to seeds or kernels,
you're more likely to reduce Don than if
[SPEAKER_03]: you apply it in the thesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could still reduce the Don correction
if you apply it in the thesis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's a complete thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the point is, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was less complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was more straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bottom line in the biopesticides is I
do think that there's a lot of promise to
[SPEAKER_03]: them, but I don't know one out right now
to confidently tell you you should go out
[SPEAKER_03]: and buy this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we definitely need more research,
and I think it is probably also going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a situation where you'll try something
out on your farm and have experiences and
[SPEAKER_03]: see what you like and what works well for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have to talk more about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do some work in your literature,
if you have some questions, I'll share my
[SPEAKER_03]: time and information at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to mention too, I think,
I don't know if any of you have heard my
[SPEAKER_03]: colleague Ken Wise speak about some of the
new alternatives to research.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably aware there's a lot of
information now and energy around finding
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives to the genetic engineering
insecticides, and I think some of that may
[SPEAKER_03]: be beneficial to the organic community as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we're investigating alternative seed
treatments or some cultural controls from
[SPEAKER_03]: models that are going to predict when seed
permanent pressure is going to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest, I think that will be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to worry yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working on it, and I'm hoping that
there'll be some work and information
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to wrap up with just a little
more information about biosimulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the latest I could find
proposed definition, but not finalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the challenges with
biosimulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not even an official definition
for them, which means they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated, and that can lead to a lot of
variability amongst products or amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: batches of the same product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned before plant CV extracts,
microbes, and other natural chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a more detailed list.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top four are the more common
ingredients in biosimulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CV extracts, even in the cells,
are really broad, and they're taking a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of variability depending on where the seed
was harvested from or how it's processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humid envelope acids are the more common
carbon-based acid in the CV biosimulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just five products of organic
material, even clothing, which you may
[SPEAKER_03]: have already a lot under them anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Protein hydrolisates, really hard kind of
saying that word, are just proteins broken
[SPEAKER_03]: into pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can break them into pieces with acids,
or bases, or enzymes, and also with a
[SPEAKER_03]: protein source that you're breaking up can
vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've told that depending on what the
source of the protein is can determine
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's approved for organic
production or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, just like with the bio
pesticide, it's really important to check
[SPEAKER_03]: about the product that you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microbes, and then also an issue about
extracts, enzymes, cytosine, and
[SPEAKER_03]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think over time, we're going to be
getting more and more information about
[SPEAKER_03]: biosimulans and how we can use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple things to keep in mind,
there is a lot of variability in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: the source of materials within those
groups, in terms of the extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: methods, and between batches, and all of
those things impact how well the products
[SPEAKER_03]: work, if they work on your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned earlier organic approval.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a live microbe, obviously you want
to think about storage and shelf life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this last point I think is an
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of these biosimulans work by
increasing the plant's ability to be
[SPEAKER_03]: resilient in the face of stress,
if you use these products in multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but some years are more stressful
for your plant than others, you might
[SPEAKER_03]: expect to see more of an impact when the
plant experiences stress than when it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some ways, it's a little bit of an
assurance because you can always predict
[SPEAKER_03]: when your plant is going to experience
stress, but just another complication to
[SPEAKER_03]: be aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's late, but my contact
information is here, including my phone
[SPEAKER_03]: number, and if you'd like to get in touch,
and I appreciate your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any questions for Amara?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: So condensers for Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard that some people have had
success using it for white hole and
[SPEAKER_03]: soybeans, but I've also heard that it's a
situation where it probably works better
[SPEAKER_03]: if you apply it year after year after
year, because you're degrading slertia in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil, and so you're reducing your
population of white hole packaging in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also heard it's for each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the things I know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also can be, I do have one of those
biopsy profiles about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the timing is tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's a live fungus,
and because you have to get it in touch
[SPEAKER_03]: with the slertia in the soil and not dry
out, the timing won't fit into me without
[SPEAKER_03]: getting it in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's potentially an option,
but I'm happy to get your contact
[SPEAKER_03]: information and remind myself of those
details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Keith Waldron will look at that a
little bit in field crops, and also Helene
[SPEAKER_03]: Diller has looked at vegetables or snap
beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it can work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be a little bit of a key end.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
