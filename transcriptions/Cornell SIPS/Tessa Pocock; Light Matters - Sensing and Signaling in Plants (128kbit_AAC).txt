[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to thank Bob Langhans visiting
scholar program for hosting me here today
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course all the folks at Cornell who
always give me such a warm welcome when I
[SPEAKER_06]: visit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So light is the most important
environmental factor for photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_06]: organisms and I thought I understood it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with plants all of my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did graduate studies on light
acclimation of wheat and also light
[SPEAKER_06]: acclimation and photo protection in an
Antarctic green algae.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I knew light but it wasn't until 2007
when I joined Heliospectra that was
[SPEAKER_06]: founded by plant physiologists.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were the two of us working with LEDs
and it was then that the light came on and
[SPEAKER_06]: we grew a small engineering team along
with a couple of plant physiologists and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's when I started fusing engineering
into my plant physiological research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a photograph of the different
colors of the sky and when I saw this it
[SPEAKER_06]: prompted me to start experimenting with
spectral compositions to see if I could
[SPEAKER_06]: replicate these colors and below is the
panel of photographs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a styrofoam in the back of a growth
cabinet where I did these experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it showed one that we can replicate
these colors and two that we have a really
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful tool now to create any kind of
spectral condition that we want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't the first person to be obsessed
with light quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a cyanometer that was invented by
de Saussure and he used it in the Swiss
[SPEAKER_06]: Alps to measure the blueness of the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also used in 1802 by Alexander von
Humboldt when he characterized the South
[SPEAKER_06]: American volcano.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did a complete physical and botanical
characterization of the volcano and he was
[SPEAKER_06]: able to classify the color of the sky as
he ascended the volcano.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the same note and light changes and
I think when I saw this figure that was
[SPEAKER_06]: published by Lou Albright it was shocking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lou showed that there is a large annual
variation in daily light integral on any
[SPEAKER_06]: given day in Ithaca, New York and this is
an annual variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a 14 year study.
[SPEAKER_06]: So light is variable, the PPFD is variable
and on a shorter time scale it can be seen
[SPEAKER_06]: here that light and PPFD, sorry it's watts
per square meter on the y axis there,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we also see really short term
fluctuations in the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now these studies are usually performed to
understand and improve performance
[SPEAKER_06]: estimations for solar energy systems and
so they look at these very fast
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuations in the sun to see how they're
going to affect the grid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we've got seconds on the x axis
and you can see that if you take the
[SPEAKER_06]: average of this three hour long fragment
it's 450 watts per meter squared but we
[SPEAKER_06]: can see that it jumps from 100 to 700
watts per meter squared in less than a
[SPEAKER_06]: second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this may not have implications for
solar energy systems but plants can
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly detect this and it's made me
really interested in dynamic lighting and
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuating lighting for controlling crop
growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the same time that PFD is
fluctuating, the spectrum fluctuates as
[SPEAKER_06]: well throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: As the clouds pass over you get a blue and
rich spectrum under that piece of cloud
[SPEAKER_06]: and then when that moves it comes to a
more flat spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a greenhouse in Sweden that I
lived in for three days with my assistant
[SPEAKER_06]: measuring light and the physiological
state of the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their basal was getting to the grocery
store half dead and they didn't know
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it was happening at the end of its
life in the greenhouse or during
[SPEAKER_06]: transportation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we monitored light for three days and
just examined the environment,
[SPEAKER_06]: did physiological testing and found out it
was the temperature of the delivery truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: But during that time I was able to study
the spectrum and PFD during the day under
[SPEAKER_06]: shake or under thermal curtains etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: and that was a really useful study.
[SPEAKER_06]: So plants have evolved for 400 million
years under fluctuating light and this can
[SPEAKER_06]: be on a long or short term time scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not utilize this in large scale
growing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Also why not use the intrinsic properties
of LEDs to modulate our crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: So how is this done?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well there are two systems in plants that
sense, detect light and then signal to the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant what to do and I'm just going to
quickly go through them here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one is the photoreceptor
system that we're all familiar with and it
[SPEAKER_06]: induces responses ranging from immunity
and defense right up to flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 15 different photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the UVR8 here which is the UV
photoreceptor primarily involved in
[SPEAKER_06]: defense and photo protection.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the cryptochromes which absorb
from blue up until the green and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in biochemical chemistry as well
as circadian rhythm primarily.
[SPEAKER_06]: The phototropins are movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're another blue photoreceptor family
and the zeit lube is a timekeeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also absorbing in the blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the phytochromes which are just
so well known and well characterized and
[SPEAKER_06]: they absorb and are activated across the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of these are reversible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them are reversible but primarily
cryptochromes and the phytochromes are
[SPEAKER_06]: reversible using different spectra of
light and so they really do provide a
[SPEAKER_06]: molecular switch for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have the same diagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the photoreceptors here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no green photoreceptor elucidated
yet but phytochrome absorbs in the green
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as cryptochrome so in a way they
do function in photoreception in the
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got the photoreceptor and we've
got the action.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the peak maximum for the
action spectra for the various
[SPEAKER_06]: photoreceptors and you can see that it
goes down from 280 nanometers which is the
[SPEAKER_06]: UVB area right up to 733 nanometers so the
far red spectrum except right here there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a gap from about 600 to 660 nanometers
which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I came across a paper describing the
action spectrum of PS2 of photosystem 2
[SPEAKER_06]: photodamage and it occurred right in this
area so maybe that has something to do
[SPEAKER_06]: with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at the activation times I work in
engineering so we're always looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: rate constants and timing and trying to do
things as fast as possible and so they
[SPEAKER_06]: work relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see the next sensing system
you'll see that this might even be a
[SPEAKER_06]: little sluggish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this brings us to the photosynthetic
sensing system or photosynthetic control
[SPEAKER_06]: as we know it and when I did my PhD and
master's I worked in a lab where we looked
[SPEAKER_06]: at this in various organisms from
cyanobacteria right up to poplar and
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at photosynthetic control of these
organisms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what does it elicit?
[SPEAKER_06]: It elicits a lot of responses that help
sustain photosynthesis in a changing or
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuating environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got light capture,
photosynthetic efficiency and CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: assimilation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've also got rapid accumulation of
pigments to help protect the
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthetic machinery and when you grow
under conditions where photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_06]: control is active then you also have
protection and defense and in long term
[SPEAKER_06]: you can actually adjust the height and
other morphological factors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: So here is my very simple schematic of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two photosystems, photosystem 2
and photosystem 1 that work
[SPEAKER_06]: electrochemically in series.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a mobile plastoquinone electron
carrier that transports the electrons from
[SPEAKER_06]: photosystem 2 where they're extracted from
water and brings them through a series of
[SPEAKER_06]: carriers to photosystem 1 where they
reduce NADP to NADPH.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time plastoquinone pool drops
off protons into the lumen and this drives
[SPEAKER_06]: in ATPase to generate ATP.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got the two chemical energy
components that the plant cell uses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is photosynthetic control?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime you have a situation where you
have light energy exceeding chemical
[SPEAKER_06]: energy utilization by the plant you have
an upset and that upset triggers hundreds
[SPEAKER_06]: of genes and 26 different pathways that
will help protect the machinery against
[SPEAKER_06]: this energy imbalance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically this is done by subjecting
the plant to high light because then
[SPEAKER_06]: you're increasing the energy input.
[SPEAKER_06]: At low temperature it works as well
because you're decreasing the reaction
[SPEAKER_06]: rates of photosynthesis so you end up with
excess energy again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you have a nutrient deficiency
you're limiting the number of electron
[SPEAKER_06]: sinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again you're pushing this energy
balance in the chloroplast out of whack
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is going to signal all of these
responses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So during photosynthetic control you've
got the two main signals.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the delta pH across these bilicoid
membrane and reaction oxygen species and
[SPEAKER_06]: the redox state of ferredoxin and
thyridoxin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a few others as well that
aren't on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can throw this out of balance using
the spectrum as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where LEDs can come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So PS2, we call it P680, absorbs
preferentially at 680 nanometers and
[SPEAKER_06]: photosystem 1 is P700.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it absorbs preferentially at 700.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have something that we call PS2
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: PS2 light overexcites PS2 compared to PS1
and this is wavelengths below 680
[SPEAKER_06]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any red or blue LED fixture used in
plant growth is basically giving the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: PS2 light.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does the plant deal with this?
[SPEAKER_06]: It will adjust the stoichiometry of
PS2-PS1 unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll have more PS2 than PS1 relative
to PS2 to deal with this red and blue
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never see it in nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: PS1 light of course is when you go up to
the far red and if you have a good balance
[SPEAKER_06]: you should have a good stoichiometry of
your photosystems and smooth sailing of
[SPEAKER_06]: the electrons right through to carbon
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the same diagram but just depicted
a little differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again I've got the time constants of
these reactions listed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have light harvesting and charge
separation which is when the electron in
[SPEAKER_06]: photosystem 2 goes from water to the QB
binding site.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call that charge separation.
[SPEAKER_06]: This occurs on femto and pico second
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Electron transport occurs on milliseconds
to second time scale and you've got carbon
[SPEAKER_06]: metabolism which is primarily minutes to
occur.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have orders of magnitude difference
in the rate constants for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can certainly drive LEDs at the
millisecond and second time scales.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should theoretically be able to drive
them at nanosecond time scales but I've
[SPEAKER_06]: never seen that yet in a practical way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can utilize LEDs for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: With pulse width modulation which is a
really popular way to dim LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we've got the duty cycles for LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the duty cycle is the percentage of
time the light is on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at 100% the light is on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no off period.
[SPEAKER_06]: At 80% you've got the lights on.
[SPEAKER_06]: At 80% of the time during the period 50%,
20% and then 0% duty cycle of course the
[SPEAKER_06]: lights are all off hopefully although this
can be a challenge sometimes for lighting
[SPEAKER_06]: fixture developers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we've just got sort of a
pictogram describing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can utilize this to help sort of
unbalance the chloroplast to achieve these
[SPEAKER_06]: responses that might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Warburg or we can do the opposite is drive
it so that we've got efficient
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthesis under other circumstances
that might throw the balance off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Warburg found that 40 milliseconds of dark
was adequate to oxidize the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthetic electron transfer chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to keep photosynthesis continuing you
need to give it 40 milliseconds of dark in
[SPEAKER_06]: a period and you'll get all those
electrons moving along to carbon
[SPEAKER_06]: metabolism and the reaction sensors open
and able to accept a photon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tennyson later on using a 680 nanometer
LED found that 198 milliseconds of dark in
[SPEAKER_06]: the period was too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It decreased the rates of photosynthesis
and so we need to find the balance and we
[SPEAKER_06]: need to understand the effects of pulse
width modulation on photochemistry and
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're looking at different fixtures
and you call the companies, I do this all
[SPEAKER_06]: the time, I ask are you dimming using
pulse width modulation and it's very
[SPEAKER_06]: popular to do that in human centric
lighting but we're easy to trick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: They see a lot more than we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite often they don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something that they don't think
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our question is photosynthetic control
is rapid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we use PWM to adjust this and play
with this?
[SPEAKER_06]: One last thing before I move away from
LEDs is the phase of pulse width
[SPEAKER_06]: modulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great study published by Shimada
et al.
[SPEAKER_06]: where they use red and blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have 100% duty cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: The R and B LEDs are running full time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we've got a 45% duty cycle where the
red and blue LED are going on and off in
[SPEAKER_06]: phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we have the red and blue LEDs,
again a 45% duty cycle, but they're going
[SPEAKER_06]: off and on in different phases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you, I've designed a six
wavelength fixture and got the engineers
[SPEAKER_06]: to make it so all of the LEDs when we
pulse width modulate them will come on and
[SPEAKER_06]: off in phase so that we don't have to do
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at these Arabidopsis plants,
you've got most growth, better growth,
[SPEAKER_06]: better performance it looks like in the
plants grown under the 45% duty cycle when
[SPEAKER_06]: they are in phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that throws a bit of a wrench into the
works for light designers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to go to the paper,
it's an engineering paper, probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably did, but no quantitative
data.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to actually read through and see
their methods and statistics again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's hundreds of experiments of
light quality and plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Porter pointed out in his 2010 paper
that none of these experiments have been
[SPEAKER_06]: set up in such a way that we can actually
quantify and compare the analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are different wavelengths,
different peak maxima, different
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way we can generalize and sort
of make a unified theory for LEDs and
[SPEAKER_06]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to show a bit of the data
that we've generated in the lab over the
[SPEAKER_06]: last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to bring home three main
findings that I think are really
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking at the different fixtures that
we grew under and we do all of our work
[SPEAKER_06]: under sole source lighting at RPI.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got PFD here along the Y axis and of
course wavelengths here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the cool white fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll think about it a bit later,
which is a nice standard spectrum that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're all used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Illumitex is this red line here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a peak at 660, tiny little bit
of white.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't see it here, but I can measure
it with my spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of green.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the red or the blue peak here at
about 450 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Phillips is 660 nanometers red,
470 nanometers in blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Veloia is a phosphor-converted LED.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that it's a blue LED typically
with a phosphor spread on the lens to
[SPEAKER_06]: broaden the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're using blue, but they're using UV
now as well for some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: phosphor-converted LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so here you've got a peak at about 440
and this broad shoulder over the green and
[SPEAKER_06]: red into the far red.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you that aren't familiar
with the spectrum, this is blue from 400
[SPEAKER_06]: to 500, green, red, and far red.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the last one is Fiona.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Danish lamp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got a peak here at 660 and a
peak here at 434 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we grew under all of these spectra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our model organism in the lab is lettuce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is red lettuce ruxi growing under
cool white fluorescent, Phillips,
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona, and Veloia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to just focus on these two.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are two red and blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They look identical to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a 36 nanometer difference in
the peak maximum of the blue LED.
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at the difference in the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're significantly smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, we'll see some results in the
next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same PPFD, 200 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same temperature, same nutrient solution,
same CO2, same relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is done at RPI, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Sweden, you can mimic anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually, and I have some data at
the end of this talk, which I wasn't going
[SPEAKER_06]: to present, where I did spectral analyses
on an island in the North Atlantic off
[SPEAKER_06]: Gothenburg, just north of Gothenburg.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it was very blue in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it evened out during the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the evening, again, there was also
a blue light presence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, probably from the scattering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always cloudy there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a lot of blue light enrichment
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to look at the fresh weight for
green lettuce, red lettuce, basil,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the height on basil, between these two
red and blue fixtures, you can see that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're significantly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the grower to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: How are they going to choose even the blue
and red fixtures when it can have such a
[SPEAKER_06]: huge effect on your crop?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking that the Fiona would be
really good, because I had a lower blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, oh, that will activate a
lot of the biochemistry and sickness of
[SPEAKER_06]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was actually not a good.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants were significantly smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we withdrew it from our trials after
two or three goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we replaced it with an Illumitex
fixture, which I showed you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's essentially blue and red.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a tiny bit of white, which gives a
little bit of green to the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have red lead of ruxi again.
[SPEAKER_06]: The LED treatments, there was no
significant difference in the fresh
[SPEAKER_06]: weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this cool white fluorescent did
have significantly lower fresh weights at
[SPEAKER_06]: day 16.
[SPEAKER_06]: The anthocyanin was highest that we always
see under the cool white fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're now delineating which one of
those peaks are actually responsible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've gone through the green.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does give a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's actually going to be a
combination of couple peaks in that
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum that is responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have high anthocyanins here,
the red pigment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have extremely low biochemistry
occurring under the Valoya fixtures.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've measured carotenoids,
chlorophylls, and anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we see the same in all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking at the anthocyanin,
we tried different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have ruxi here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got anthocyanin concentration there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red salad bowl, red gis, and red sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can see in more cases than not,
under the foster converted spectrum,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have lower anthocyanin concentrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we threw in even more cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have our standard ruxi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had the salanova red butter and red
oak leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm calling the Illumitex here red,
blue, and white, because usually when I
[SPEAKER_06]: speak at conferences in the engineering
world, I don't like to give the name away
[SPEAKER_06]: of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the Valoya foster converted,
cool white fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got the Phillips red and blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the difference in the morphology,
the leaf size.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you touch these plants, you can feel
the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: The red butter under the Illumitex,
very hairy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the culinary institute would say,
how's bad mouth feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not very pleasant to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that changes depending on the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this under the cool white
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants can't even stand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've repeated this now about six or
seven times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing the same results every
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one common thread, because there's no
commonality here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one common thread is that under these
foster converted fixtures, there are as
[SPEAKER_06]: poor anthocyanin concentration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this led to the question of,
is it something specific in the foster
[SPEAKER_06]: conversion of LEDs that is responsible for
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I met Wouter Sauer at several actual
conferences actually engineering
[SPEAKER_06]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is an engineer that works for
Lumileds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I discussed this problem with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the problems was that I could
never really see if it was the foster
[SPEAKER_06]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the other LEDs that I'm comparing
to have different spectral ratios.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might be the spectral ratio and not
the phosphor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we specced out, and these are just
photos of different fosters that I took at
[SPEAKER_06]: a trade booth at this conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're using up to five different fosters
for one LED to actually get different
[SPEAKER_06]: spectral distributions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Wouter and I specced out some fixtures
that had roughly 20% blue, 20% green,
[SPEAKER_06]: and 60% red.
[SPEAKER_06]: We find that's a really nice spectral
ratio to grow under.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we achieved that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have lime.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are my growth cabinets here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got what we call the lime LED,
the green, the purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's no green.
[SPEAKER_06]: The valoya.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have direct emission LEDs that
we built ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point, we're just running them
on an RGB red, green, blue program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our numbers are pretty good,
close as we could get them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have the spectral
distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got photon flux density and
wavelengths here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got our RBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got the red at 660, green at 530.
[SPEAKER_06]: And blue at 450.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the green and the lime LEDs,
which are these lines here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All slightly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the valoya, which is this big
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the purple, of course, there's no
green.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where are we seeing differences?
[SPEAKER_06]: So rather than finding commonalities in
the plants, I'm looking for commonality in
[SPEAKER_06]: the spectra.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: About the spectrum that is causing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we see the valoya has very little
green.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to see why this is
important compared to the lime and the
[SPEAKER_06]: green.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got this big area here, right where
the action spectrum for photo damage is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you'd think it would make
anthocyanin to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's got a little bit of a
difference here in far red.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't take that into account when I
spec'd the light.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my mistake, because there's quite
a difference there between far red,
[SPEAKER_06]: between the fixtures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's look at some data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is essentially phosphor converted
versus direct emission LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the yield is greater for the lime and
green and valoya.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the anthocyanin is much lower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not all phosphors are created equal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the spectrum matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anthocyanin is more spectrally sensitive
than yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not all phosphors are created equal,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next work was, can we use the
spectrum to modulate plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: So here is a valoya-grown plant and a cool
white fluorescent plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens when we shift a plant from a
non-biochemically active spectrum to a
[SPEAKER_06]: biochemically active one?
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to increase the anthocyanin
concentration 18-fold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got a small movie here.
[SPEAKER_06]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a time lapse of 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not officially.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all have our favorites, but I would
love to do that.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hooked.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has grabbed me.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, unfortunately not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a semiconductor lab, so I'm kind of
building it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a spectrophotometer, and I've got
this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got access now to HPLC, but I would
love to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I did the shift experiment back,
and it's about 24 to 48 hours,
[SPEAKER_06]: just to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on the life history of the
plant a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can shift it back and change the
morphology changes as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can just move it back and forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not grow a plant under LEDs that
produces large biomass, and at the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: finish it off so that we can pack it full
of nutrients and maybe save energy at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time, is sort of my theory.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to speed up here through
the last bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked a lot in photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really interested in energy in the
chlorophyte.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is my pulse amplitude modulated
fluorometer that I got out and used during
[SPEAKER_06]: the shifts to see what was happening to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got effective quantum yield,
so the probability that a photon will be
[SPEAKER_06]: used in a photochemical act.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have, the lower it is,
the less efficient it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we've got the plants at time zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were pretty good at .64.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we shifted, and this is one
minute, after the shift, we saw an
[SPEAKER_06]: increase in effective quantum yield
throughout the 24-hour shift.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we shifted it back here,
and it decreased.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we were able to measure this
within one minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason it took me a minute was
because I had to jump behind a laser
[SPEAKER_06]: curtain and press start on the computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, if I had an assistant at that
time, we could have actually done it a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-photochemical quenching is the
dissipation of absorbed light energy as
[SPEAKER_06]: heat, typically through the xanthophyll
cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It indicates that there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a blockage, and it has to get rid
of that energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the shift, it was normal values,
but high.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the shift, it went down,
shifted it back to the original spectrum,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it goes back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: This makes really good sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it shows how we can detect this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started with a bunch of
undergraduates building detectors in the
[SPEAKER_06]: lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the first prototype.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the excitation light.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a photodiode picking up the
chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see how close we're working
with to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is my very expensive German pulse
amplitude modulation fluorometer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have low temperature
photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: The open circles are measured using the
ERC student device, and the dark circles
[SPEAKER_06]: are my commercially bought device.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're right on measurement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're measuring stress with both
detectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's move further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second round of students came in.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our second prototype.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the excitation light here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the photodiodes there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working at 40 centimeters from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're able to detect about a half of a
1020 flat.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was pulled from an engineering
student's report.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see that they've had to
indicate that this is a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is more than one plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have docked marks for that,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a duel of the centers here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dark-adapting plants, which is a bit
of a pain, measuring the maximum quantum
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency of photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see, shifting basal from 23 degrees
to 5 degrees, we get the standard decrease
[SPEAKER_06]: in FV over FM.
[SPEAKER_06]: Using the student sensor, we're seeing,
again, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I thought, okay, this is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sensing all the time, because we have
these sensors, and I've got a group of
[SPEAKER_06]: students coming into the lab to build more
this summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we can get some at Cornell as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we've got a 16-hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the signal emanated from the
plant at 740 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the signal that we usually
detect with the PAM, 680 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 640 is a bit more complicated signal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can talk about it more to anybody who's
interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the sake of time, I won't now.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we noticed was this oscillation
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done this on lettuce and basal,
about 10 different crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see is, this is the
chlorophyll fluorescence yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's high, photosynthesis is
downregulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's low, photosynthesis is running
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the morning, when the lights come
on, it's getting all the enzymes ready for
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon assimilation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it flattens out during the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, about 10 hours into the 16-hour
photo period, chlorophyll fluorescence
[SPEAKER_06]: goes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So photosynthesis is being downregulated
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: What should we do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we turn the lights down and save
energy when it's apparently not using it
[SPEAKER_06]: in photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do we use spectral combinations to try
to mitigate this open stomata,
[SPEAKER_06]: force it to not have that afternoon nap?
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are two questions that I have
that I'd really like to work on together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have death, which,
again, the students forgot to water
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, all of this data is uploaded
to the cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can check it regularly from home.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell exactly when they didn't
come in and when they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with circadian rhythm, because we're
seeing that here, what they do in animal
[SPEAKER_06]: systems is they say, OK, put it in the
continuous dark and see if you see that
[SPEAKER_06]: oscillatory pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't do that with plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put it in continuous light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's a 24-hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we've got another death by
dehydration experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing the same oscillation.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is super exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one last thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did this during growth of basil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see similar oscillatory pattern
happening here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, an increase in growth,
well, in fluorescence, because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: filling out the flask.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're getting a bit taller.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether in a greenhouse or a plant
factory, light definitely matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we should be thinking,
now that we have the ability to turn off
[SPEAKER_06]: and on a light source at 200 nanoseconds,
maybe we should be thinking about how to
[SPEAKER_06]: use that to modulate plants that are used
to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need more knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants acclimate in a different way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to integrate this into control
systems with the potential outcome of
[SPEAKER_06]: saving energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I couldn't have done this alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My lab is three years old now at RPI.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to thank all of the
support staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob Karlocheck has been really supportive
of this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, all of my undergraduate
students that have contributed to the work
[SPEAKER_06]: that I've shown today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to take questions.
That
[SPEAKER_03]: was just the student sensor.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blue line is we have two photodiodes
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got a 680 filter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a photodiode and 740 filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this non-technical?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why I'm going to be testing
it ASAP.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as we automate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to move further and bigger,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it's so important to speak
with engineers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, the field of view will be
dependent on the height.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the objects of that photodiode.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the excitation light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the excitation light has to
illuminate the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this will be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most pantherometers work with saturating
pulses.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the old text, it said they were the
same intensity as a bright sun,
[SPEAKER_06]: which would be about 2,500 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we're using saturating pulses of
8,000 to 20,000 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you try to use that, in this kind
of sensing, you've killed the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if actually we're not saturating,
which is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our colleagues at Geneva may have a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Geneva, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you did your 24-hour spectral change
experiment in video, that was kind of in a
[SPEAKER_00]: younger meat or plant type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you think of mature plant
type would have an impact either as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're thinking to finish plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've done it with larger plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like any time I have anything going on,
I shift things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we did see it under older plants
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 21 to 28-day plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't usually grow beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: These LED lighting companies will talk
about light recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, here you go,
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can develop a light recipe for
your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: How easy is it to develop a light recipe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would there be like millions of
combinations?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a red and blue LED,
it's like, do you want 20% of blue or 80%?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of the light recipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you're working with, I spent
eight years developing light recipes,
[SPEAKER_06]: 7, 10 lamps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done over 60 experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it takes a couple of years really to
be confident that you have the recipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really like calling it recipe
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to call it a light protocol
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or algorithm.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've discussed that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because recipe sounds like I'm just in the
kitchen picking up my flour and butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's harder than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those recipes, those protocols would also
really only be transferable, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's any growth change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you tried to use them in a
greenhouse, whether you're in Tucson or
[SPEAKER_05]: New York or Sweden, I suspect it's
terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's a lot of darkness,
like in Sweden, it's like soul source
[SPEAKER_06]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, you never see the sun when
you've got the lights on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But any tweak in your nutrient solution
and your temperature and any growing
[SPEAKER_06]: condition will alter it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I find, if someone takes it into
their soul source lighting area,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't replicate my growing
conditions exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I envision for that is,
and my greenhouse measurements in Sweden
[SPEAKER_06]: did show that spectrum changes throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did develop some dynamic lighting
that I can't discuss or kill me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we did, but what I would like to
do is, as soon as we get our spectrometer
[SPEAKER_06]: up and running and automated in the
greenhouse, we'll be able to record the
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum and then perhaps utilize the LEDs
to bring the spectrum up to a set point
[SPEAKER_06]: that we know is beneficial for our crops,
so that you have stable, consistent supply
[SPEAKER_06]: of your crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is when I have it with no photo
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it entrained to the 16-hour on,
16-hour off, and then to the continuous
[SPEAKER_02]: light?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really got to get the students to
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you saw in the photos of my lab,
where are the plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any final questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University, on the web, at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
