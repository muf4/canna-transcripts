[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming here to hear about
the vegetable germplasm conservation and
[SPEAKER_01]: research at the Plant Genetic Resources in
Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the vegetable curator for the Plant
Genetic Resources Unit at the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA is the ARS National Plant
Germplasm System.
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes germplasm repositories across
the country, all the way from Pullman to
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami and Geneva to Riverside and also we
have at Hilo in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: These include the regional plant
introduction stations, various colonel
[SPEAKER_01]: repositories and crop specific
collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also some genetic stock collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: The National Plant Germplasm System is a
national network of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations conserving plant genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes both federal, state and
private organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coordination is by the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: While most of the funding is federal
funding, there is also funding from state
[SPEAKER_01]: and private organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the project at Geneva has
funding from Cornell through the Northeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have different companies,
seed companies I work with like Nunum's
[SPEAKER_01]: out in Oregon who help with regenerations
of onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major objectives of the National Plant
Germplasm System, which is the same for
[SPEAKER_01]: all the different plant introduction
stations, colonel repositories,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, is to acquire germplasm,
to preserve the genetic diversity that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, to document and catalog this,
both passport and characterization and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation data, to evaluate this
germplasm and most importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The germplasm collections are not museum
collections, but they're living
[SPEAKER_01]: collections which are used.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two sites that are national in
scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The National Genetic Resources Laboratory
operates the Genetic Resources Information
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has all the data available from
collection, environmental data,
[SPEAKER_01]: where material was collected, past
collections, characterization and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation data, and this is available
anywhere in the world through the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are releasing shortly, beginning
October 1st, a new version of this
[SPEAKER_01]: database which is easier for users to
access, where they can actually download
[SPEAKER_01]: large quantities of data through Excel
sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other major activity of this
laboratory is the Plant Exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: They handle all the issues for germplasm
exchange internationally, both germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and germplasm leaving the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also arrange for collection missions
because now with the national rights for
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm has come up in Convention on
Biological Diversity, there's many issues
[SPEAKER_01]: of getting permissions and handling
benefit sharing for germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other activity of the National Genetic
Resources Laboratory is also very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Crop Germplasm Committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are groups of users and other
researchers who meet with the curators of
[SPEAKER_01]: various crops to set issues, for example,
what should be characterized, what should
[SPEAKER_01]: be brought into the collection,
and deal with issues such as duplicates in
[SPEAKER_01]: developing vulnerability statements.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the National Seed Storage
Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a part of a larger national center
for genetic resources preservation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they maintain base collections of all
the germplasm across the country in Fort
[SPEAKER_01]: Collins at minus 20 as far as seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also do research on new techniques
for preserving germplasm, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: the clonal repositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the major clonal collection
that's preserved is the apple collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using dormant buds and liquid
nitrogen vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to develop techniques for
other clonal crops that would be as
[SPEAKER_01]: successful as this technique is with
apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also maintain voucher samples
such as PVP samples and also some black
[SPEAKER_01]: box collections where we're just
maintaining them as black boxes with no
[SPEAKER_01]: access.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the Plant Genetic Resources Unit,
the National Research and Marketing Act of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1946 authorized four regional plant
introduction stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva is one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The others are at Pullman, Washington,
Ames, Iowa, and Griffin, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: In July 1948, the Northeast Regional
Project, NE9, was started.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was developed into the Northeastern
Regional Plant Introduction Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in 1984, the apple repository was
established as a part of the PGRU.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had been established several years
earlier by Cornell University and was
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred to the Plant Genetic Resources
Unit as a federal collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two of them were merged in 1988 to
form the Plant Genetic Resources Unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 1984, we've added coats,
hardy grapes, and tart cherries to the
[SPEAKER_01]: clonal repository.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our objectives are to conserve and restore
and regenerate plant genetic resources
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions in the gene bank and in the
field as far as the clonal repositories to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure its long-term availability for
research and crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working to strategically expand the
genetic diversity in the collection,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to expand the information,
both passport and characterization data
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have for these collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working to both genetic,
do genotypic and phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: characterization and evaluation of this
germplasm to increase the utilization
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've started recently both vegetable and
fruit germplasm working on quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional traits, and traits that have a
health benefiting effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our major, as with the whole,
germplasm system, major objective is to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute this germplasm both nationally
and internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows the vegetable genetic resources
conserved at Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a total of about 12,580.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of this collection is tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have both cultivated and wild,
the 6,600 includes about 600 accessions of
[SPEAKER_01]: wild tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our other major collections are cold crops
or things such as cabbage, cauliflower,
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli, et cetera, and onion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have large collections of squash
and radish and smaller collections of
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatillo or husk tomato, celery,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large part of the tomato collections
backed up Overall, 71% of our germplasm is
[SPEAKER_01]: backed up, and this is like I mentioned
before at Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vegetable collections are basically
seed-propagated collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our crops, except tomato,
are cross-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many are biennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, except for tomato, what we
actually use to produce seed is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's unlike other crops like agronomic
crops, we have the problem that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the product that's used for the seed
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our germplasm acquisition is from
germplasm collection missions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more and more recently has been from
other germplasm collections and from
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding programs, both public and
private.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our acquisition is more targeted now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific regions for specific crops or
specific traits are certain types of
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have integration populations for
tomato that we acquired from Israel that
[SPEAKER_01]: are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our collections, our germplasm
acquisition is user-directed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, one of the major ways we do this is
through those crop germplasm committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They meet an average of every year to year
and a half at various other meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have this meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we look at the pattern of seed
requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see what kinds of crops are being
requested, but what type of traits are
[SPEAKER_01]: being requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're using to direct our
acquisition efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to show here is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is origins for various vegetable
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that this shows the importance
of the germplasm collections that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: have in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing you need to point out,
especially in this area and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, it's very difficult to obtain
access to collect germplasm or to get
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm back to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: than other germplasm collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to access this
germplasm now with the Convention on
[SPEAKER_01]: Biological Diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this stresses the importance of what we
have and maintaining it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, we did have a collection since I've
been here in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some of the genetic diversity
here with tomatoes, tomatillo,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our collection, this is a cultivated crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had previously been involved in about 35
collections when I worked at Icarta
[SPEAKER_01]: working with food legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the principle is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, you go with cultivated crops
to the field as they're being harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know where the region is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes, you go to local markets,
which are higher probability that the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that's being sold is from that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to a local market in Mexico
like Puebla, you're probably getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop that was grown locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to the Mexico City,
if you go there to a local market,
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop could have come from anywhere in
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an example here with tomato,
how germplasm... The tomato originated in
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazil, I mean in the Andes area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went to South America in the 1500s to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original tomato germplasm in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: came from Europe, not from the center of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from where the crop was
domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the 1930s, USDA collectors and
then later C.M.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick at the Tomato Genetic Resources
Center brought a lot of wild species
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and this has been intergraced into the
populations for various traits such as
[SPEAKER_01]: disease resistance and other pest
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, some of the geographic origins of
brassica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are where you see the leafy ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cabbage down in Italy, broccoli and
cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some indications of early
domestication in the Mediterranean region,
[SPEAKER_01]: eastern part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is an example of a very difficult to
accomplish, but we've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germplasm exchange with China recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We received, actually just about one month
ago, 84 accessions of Chinese cabbage,
[SPEAKER_01]: radish and buckwheat from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first official exchange since
the early 1930s with China for germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a direct result.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had sent broccoli and cauliflower to
China in 2012 and they were very excited
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and they led to them inviting
myself and the research leader,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zhang, to visit them at their expense
in September last year, about this time of
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had many discussions there with the
head of germplasm exchange at the C.A.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: about bilateral germplasm exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also recently sent germplasm of
radish in the tomato core collection to
[SPEAKER_01]: China.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about 10 days, we expect to have
the vegetable curator from the Institute
[SPEAKER_01]: of Vegetables and Flowers in Beijing
visiting us in Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to discuss further bilateral
exchanges of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discussions are also going on for the
rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit germplasm, but we've already
brought in vegetable germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is myself and Dr. Zhang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here with the head of testing,
laboratory testing at the Chinese National
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Bank in Beijing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also went to Honshu.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, they're growing out here,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the broccoli and cauliflower we
sent them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very anxious that we go down and
visit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're asking us to come back in the
spring of next year because they hope to
[SPEAKER_01]: have this in the breeding program,
full blown in their breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 200 or 300 kilometers from the
Honshu in the same province.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is close to Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've collected, we're increasing the
exposure in exchange of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lady here in the red blouse,
her name is Dr. Mia Tao.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's very instrumental in getting the
germplasm that we did in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working out protocols with her
that once germplasm is brought into China
[SPEAKER_01]: once, that they're going to be maintaining
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I receive a request for the same
accessions, I will transmit it to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will do, they won't have to
go through quarantine, they'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute it from the Chinese National
Gene Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very open to this type of
distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she said that if they get a request
for what they've sent to me from the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping to expand this germplasm
exchange to other vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several concerns we've had with our
collection are GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're difficult to put in the
collections because, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not one patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a series of patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to keep track of all the
different patents and what's still in
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it only takes one patent to make
it non-distributable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, even more important,
is the concern about contamination of GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: and non-GMO accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the point that we had it inspected from
the Office of Inspector General,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had inspectors come to us several times
and go through all our list of accessions
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually go through the Gene Bank
itself, looking to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other concern we have is problems with
IPR issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these affect what will go in the
collections, the MTAs, and they may reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: to less germplasm entering, intellectual
property rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you a small example of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Martha Mutchler has double haploid
onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was done with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: She really thought they should be
available for other people to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we accepted to put them in the
collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Cornell's IPR office got involved
and we had a lot of trouble with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: negotiations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the MTA they wanted was too much for
us to be able to follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the resources to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was told by the national program
leader that we could not accept this type
[SPEAKER_01]: of MTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the germplasm, we have our finite
resources and staff, so we cannot put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into something that we can't really freely
distribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to happen more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though she really would like to see
it distributed and be a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, because of that MTA was not a
type of MTA we could deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these MTAs affect our freedom of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Convention on Biological Diversity is
affecting collection missions and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: permission for missions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant exchange office I mentioned has
a lot more work nowadays for germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're worried about uncontrolled growth of
the collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a finite resource for storage,
for regeneration, for characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to avoid duplication,
both regionally, locally, internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the problems, it's becoming
more and more difficult to distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm internationally because of
property rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I didn't mention before,
quarantine is becoming so restrictive in
[SPEAKER_01]: some countries that it makes sense to have
duplication so that you don't have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through this quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in some countries, like Australia,
I worked with when I was at Icarta.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me $120,000 a year to work with
Faba bean germplasm to screen it for
[SPEAKER_01]: disease resistance because it cost them
about $800 in accession to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was cheaper to pay us to go through
the whole collection and get the score,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they only brought in what was needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they provided pathologists to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quarantine issues are becoming very
important for germplasm distribution also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our crops are stored in Geneva at minus
20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we maintain our collection at minus 20,
which helps a lot in maintaining the
[SPEAKER_01]: viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also backed up at minus 20 in Fort
Collins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our crops, as I said before, are mostly
cross-pollinated, and many are biannual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use cages, and we have beehives for
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows here a cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cages we use, this is in Brassica
here, beehives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the cages with rented, we just use
rented hives because the economics worked
[SPEAKER_01]: out much better for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do do some hand pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have squash with small numbers of
plants, it's easy to do it with hand
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an example, this is some broccoli and
tomatoes from this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This broccoli here actually is one that
we're working with Thomas Borkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually his population he's
working with with this SCRI grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Brassica, we plant cabbage about
the beginning of August, then in November
[SPEAKER_01]: dig it up, store it, and then in early
fall set it out for seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with some of the vegetable leafy
type Brassicas, we will have to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: take them to the greenhouse or polyhouse
after they have been grown in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can't store them over winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another issue, short day onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what short day onions look like
grown versus long day onions in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get them to really bulb,
and if you brought bulbs in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: they wouldn't flower because of the need
for short days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an agreement with New Mexico
State University and provide them funds to
[SPEAKER_01]: assist us in regeneration of the short
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main concerns we are concerned with
with regeneration is loss of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and loss of genetic identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also concerned about producing
disease-free seed, and also our Brassica
[SPEAKER_01]: and Allium is one of the main reasons we
went to minus 20 because their shelf life
[SPEAKER_01]: is much less than say squash or tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another major activity is characterization
of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This field is in Charleston, South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we work with breeders a lot in
collaboration for characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked many agreements with Philip
Griffiths looking at rats, radish,
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli, and cauliflower, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a minimal descriptor list we use
for these crops, highly heritable traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're working to increase the
efficiency of utilization of the
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an increasing importance of
quality in the past five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have this minimal descriptors
list have been developed on the advice of
[SPEAKER_01]: the CGCs we're working with, and we've
implemented this as part of our
[SPEAKER_01]: characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things as part of our
regeneration?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, regularly now we take digital
images.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a strong recommendation from all
five CGCs I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we do molecular and quality
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a type of image that we use that
we take for onion bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was strongly requested by the Allium
CGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a different type of image done with
tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just happens to be one of the
stuffing tomatoes we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them look like a red pepper,
bell pepper when you see them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, and people are surprised when I cut
them open that they see tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality characterization has become
more and more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have already put quality as part of our
characterization within our regeneration
[SPEAKER_01]: process for tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you later tomato core
collection, and we've worked on
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-year, multi-site evaluation of
quality for the tomato core collection
[SPEAKER_01]: with a number of collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting now our next five-year
project plan, and we're hoping to expand
[SPEAKER_01]: this to crops such as onion and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the nutritional characterization,
standard preparation of samples which are
[SPEAKER_01]: stored at minus 20 for later evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an automatic titrator here for
titratable acidity colorimeter for the
[SPEAKER_01]: lycopene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure vitamin C with a kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have worked with the chemist at
the ARS in Albany, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: For his samples with secondary
metabolites, instead of this, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the prep of the sample in liquid
nitrogen at a cryo station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our core set, as I mentioned, I won't go
over each one, but they're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: different land races, heirlooms,
a group based on the geodiversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit shape, and then we have 50,
we call obsolete varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are where we could, we tried to
trace them down to the 40s, 50s,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s where we had pieces
of EVP certificates, our other information
[SPEAKER_01]: that they released in these decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have something from Ohio State,
tomato analyzer, to look at the various
[SPEAKER_01]: morphological traits of tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It measures a number of traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several quality traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found two lines, Bonzilla,
and this one is something called AVRD6,
[SPEAKER_01]: which stood out for several of the traits
compared to the other accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same, there were duplications,
geodiversity, land race, heirloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't add up to 184 because some are
in several groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: This AVRD6 was in another group with the
geodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it, it's high for all three
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, that we found significant
genotype effects for these quality traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we did was look at the
different decades, accessions from the
[SPEAKER_01]: 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find a fairly strong with bricks,
a trend of reduced bricks from the 50s
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 90s, and some type of
indication for vitamin C, very small
[SPEAKER_01]: indication with titratable acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has been a reduction for sure in
bricks and vitamin C to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the 10, we have more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the 10th in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was canonical discriminant
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we had here was two years that we
grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the morphological traits,
the 10 gave exactly, they were right on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of each other for the morphological
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The morphological traits were very good at
distinguishing these varieties from each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the quality you can see,
they're not right on top of each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were fairly repeatable as far as the
quality traits for these 10 varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did a discriminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were looking at here was
Bell's gourmet and red bear stick out from
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason they do this is for the
morphological was size traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very different between the red
bear and the Bell's gourmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bell's gourmet, you get fruit that are
like three pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red bear is a very small tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas here with red bear and Bell's
gourmet looking with the quality traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we noticed the difference was the
different acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red bear was double the acid content
of the Bell's gourmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just trying to see which traits
and that's what showed up here for the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality factor analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first factor was traits, the sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second factor was these acid traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citric acid, malic acid, titratable
acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanne LeBate, the molecular biologist,
looked at these 50 populations that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: for 18 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she did was divide them up
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: She divided them up into private,
breeding company varieties and public
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties developed by universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically there wasn't much difference
between the two populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't much difference whether it
was public or private.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed the same values in the SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another work that we're starting on our
new project plan is the GIS or
[SPEAKER_01]: geographical information system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're looking at, there are a set
of species, new species, the new monograph
[SPEAKER_01]: on tomato, Solanum, Peruvianum has been
divided into four species including
[SPEAKER_01]: Peruvianum, Arcanum, Cornellum,
Murleyi and Hullia sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were trying to see the geographic
distribution of these species and also to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how could we distinguish these species
with markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she used some SNPs from genotyping by
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 14,043 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she did was took the red boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is distance, geographical distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vertical axis is genetic distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she did was intra-specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be like a Solanum,
Peruvianum and a Solanum, Peruvianum
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two accessions of the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the blue ones are two accessions
of different species like Peruvianum and
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see here with the red ones,
the further they are apart physically,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not a relationship with the
genetic distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see there is a relationship of
genetic distance and geographic distance
[SPEAKER_01]: for the intra-specific pairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this shows as the species get further
apart, they're more distinct from each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is shown when you try to
taxonomically key these out, which we took
[SPEAKER_01]: all 200 and did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran into problems and I think you can
see that if they're close to each other in
[SPEAKER_01]: geographic distance, they become more
close in genetic distance and it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: She looked at them with a heat map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically some species are easy to tell
apart, Peruvianum and Arcanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here this is the frequency of one
species, Arcanum, and this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency of the allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Peruvianum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the darker this is, the greater the
number of alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a pattern like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two species are more easily
separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Peruvianum and Cornell Murleyi,
which is what we saw in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was very difficult to tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see with the SNPs that there's not
this pattern which would distinguish them
[SPEAKER_01]: from each other as far as allele
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, she used the same data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Arcanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly easy to separate it from the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest of them are up here
except Huliasens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a number of these that we could
tell right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some that were more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the species taxonomically that the
taxonomists have made, you run into
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with certain ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably because of gene flow
between the species actually telling them
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with characterization and
evaluation, we're concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heritability of our traits and
reporting disease scores consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Replication both in time and environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also we have, like with tomato,
we have multi-location, multi-year
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluations and comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as I mentioned, not only at
Geneva but at other plant introduction
[SPEAKER_01]: stations and repositories, there's concern
about quality, nutrition and health
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with outreach and training in
germplasm conservation and regeneration
[SPEAKER_01]: with markers and seed production and seed
storage for characterization and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have outreach efforts in seed
production for organic production,
[SPEAKER_01]: both processing and actual control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Control pollinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've worked with demonstrations and
field days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had three projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Public Seed Initiative, which was IFAS
funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Organic Seed Partnership and the
Northern Organic Vegetable Improvement
[SPEAKER_01]: Collaborative, NOVIC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have been funded by the OREI.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first two were with Dr. Molly John.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NOVIC, the last one, has been with Dr.
Michael Mazurek as a collaborator.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NOVIC, again, Cornell is a part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State, University of Wisconsin,
Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also NGO, the Organic Seed Alliance,
and ourselves, the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Northern Organic Vegetable
Improvement Collaborative is working as
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see here, we're working with seed
production, seed processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we're looking at testing of organic
varieties on farmers' fields under organic
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions so that they can grow varieties
which perform best under their conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the breeding programs have been
working on besides disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: also extending the season, like with sweet
corn, developing sweet corn, which is more
[SPEAKER_01]: code tolerant at the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's at PGRU working with some people
with training in seed cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Public Seed Initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at the Organic Field Day here at
Freeville two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: My staff and I were at the Organic Field
Day again in Freeville.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also go regularly to the Common Fair
ground fair, showing different aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed production and providing information
for producing seed, not only processing
[SPEAKER_01]: but pollination control and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going there Thursday this week
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a student who had recently
graduated from RIT, an adult student who
[SPEAKER_01]: had finished recently and had further
training with us and two weeks ago she was
[SPEAKER_01]: hired at a laboratory in Rochester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the distribution of the germplasm
is worldwide both to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thirty-five to forty percent of all the
samples I distribute are out of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a large amount of germplasm
distribution outside the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do it for breeders, other
researchers where there's a valid use for
[SPEAKER_01]: the germplasm distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We distribute to non-profit organizations,
other institutes and universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an example, a large amount of our
germplasm is tomato as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at these totals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start 2008, 3515 and last year 14,290.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with sequestration and not being able
to fill positions, this has been very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult dealing with these
distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not just small distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been, we've provided South
Korea with whole collections of our
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm like the whole tomato,
the whole onion collection.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around three to four thousand every
year before 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why has it grown so much in the last
four years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing was, and we cut it out,
some of it was these non-research
[SPEAKER_01]: requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were giving them to them and saying,
we won't be able to give it to you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've had a number, like Noonum Seed
has asked for our whole onion collection
[SPEAKER_01]: and whole tomato collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them, why do you need it now?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, we're worried about access in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they provided me, they came
themselves and helped take the seed under
[SPEAKER_01]: our supervision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came and actually did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been repatriating germplasm to
places like South Korea where they give a
[SPEAKER_01]: list of stuff they think originally came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there have been companies doing large
scale screenings like onion for Irish
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow spot virus resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these have what have increased our
distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our problems is this germplasm is
distributed freely, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing numbers of non-research
requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't provide to farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we get a lot of gardeners and
private individuals saying they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've done has been basically
telling them where they can find seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that's more appropriate to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the sites in the germplasm system
used to say, OK, here's some of what you
[SPEAKER_01]: asked for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't ask in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are where you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've taken a very hard stand that if
I don't consider it a valid use,
[SPEAKER_01]: we send a rejection letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some complain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of those, probably one out of 10
who complain, I'll re-look at it and give
[SPEAKER_01]: it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other issues are our cost for shipping and
phytosanitary certificates have really
[SPEAKER_01]: increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been requested to provide
certification as GMO, genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: modified, as being free of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if national policy I cannot
provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot provide a letter that says we
certify as GMO free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot provide a letter that says to the
best of my knowledge, it should be genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO free.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's national policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out of my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then requirements of certification is
disease and virus free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the way we're multiplying stuff
every year, we have 400 plots a year for
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the resources for field
inspections, roguing, and testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask them to get a research exemption if
they want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, our intellectual property
rights is always an issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, we conserve, regenerate,
characterize, evaluate, and distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm of our fruit and vegetable
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The degradation of environments where the
centers of origin is making our
[SPEAKER_01]: collections more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the lack of access to these centers
of origin and centers of diversity are
[SPEAKER_01]: making the collections more important now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This germplasm is needed to maintain and
improve crop tolerances and resistances.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep getting more and more crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're asking for quality traits,
not just tomato, but they've started
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for onions, for fruit tans,
for example, quercetin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using the GBS, the molecular
biologist, and then GIS to our
[SPEAKER_01]: characterization and evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just like to acknowledge the staff and
the Plant Genetic Resources Unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanne LeBate is the molecular biologist,
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Garman is our farm manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonathan Spencer works with our bees in
characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Kisley with the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherry Tennis handles all the database
work and paperwork for seed orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nancy Consoli works with us recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: She takes care of all the seed orders and
seed packaging and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne Sheffer in the green laboratory,
and now field characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne Zweigra was a trainee that worked
a lot with the tomato characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked very much with Philip Griffiths
with different characterization projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with Michael Mazurek, not only with
Novit, but also with characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And previously with Molly John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Farnham is the ARS brassica breeder
who's been involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Brexa worked with us with the
secondary metabolites characterization for
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christopher Kramer is the onion breeder,
short-day breeder at New Mexico State,
[SPEAKER_01]: has helped out tremendously with short-day
onion regenerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Myers heads up the Novit project at
Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dilip Panthi has worked very much with us
along with Esther Vandernap in the tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: core collection quality characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
