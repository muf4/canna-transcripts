[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good morning, everybody, and thank you
for taking the time to come to this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure to tell you some of the
work we have been doing for the past
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10, 20 years already in regards
of understanding what's the function
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and how is the regulation of a
particular set of membrane transport
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that mediate response to
tolerance of a particular set of abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm showing you here is a world map,
a heat map, of the density of crop areas
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, when you look at the soils,
the suitability of soils, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clear that there's a nice correlation
where there's a high density of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture taking place with the quality
of the soils around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically do agriculture where the
soils are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you take into account that
by 2050, our population is increasing by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in about 20 years or so,
we need to increase our production by 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious that we have to start
thinking about moving into these marginal
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and start increasing the
productivity that is currently taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place in these marginal soils where the
soils are not suitable for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these marginal soils are a result of
several abiotic stresses, including
[SPEAKER_00]: drought, salinity, and also aluminum
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to tell you why aluminum toxicity is
such an important abiotic stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll first overlap a heat map describing
the pH of the soils around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acidic pHs are shown in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the total area,
of the world, about 30% of the total soils
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world are acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that constitutes about 70% of the
potentially arable lands around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes the South and tropical
band, which takes into account particular
[SPEAKER_00]: regions where food supply and food
stability is more tenuous at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is aluminum toxicity occurring in
this kind of acidic soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum is pretty harmless, neutral in
basic pHs, because it's bound to the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxides and the silica in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you start hitting low pHs,
acidic pHs, aluminum solubilizes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the pH becomes more acidic,
what happens is the predominant form that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find of aluminum in the solution,
in the rhizosphere, is Al3+.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this particular form of aluminum
which is actually phytotoxic to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how toxic is it really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just show you a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two maize varieties grown in the
South and part of Brazil in acidic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there's an
aluminum-resistant variety and
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum-sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitive variety actually has a
significant loss of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, this is two contrasting
varieties from wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aluminum-sensitive variety,
what you can see, is a really dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between organic inhibition or
loss of the root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the primary symptom of aluminum
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum, as soon as you expose the roots
to aluminum, the root growth ceases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that results in is a loss of water
uptake, loss of mineral uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ultimately what it translates into is
this loss of yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a micrograph showing you
the degree of injury that roots actually
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon exposure to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the same wheat varieties I'm
showing you right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, there is a generic
variation in crop plant species which we
[SPEAKER_00]: can exploit to understand what are the
physiological mechanisms that underlie
[SPEAKER_00]: this aluminum-resistance process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most crops, what has been found,
it was early described back in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s, is that those aluminum-resistant
varieties actually upon exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum, the roots release organic acids
into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these organic acids do is they
complex the aluminum, they chelate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they form complexes that A,
are not toxic, and B, are not taken up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they're excluding aluminum from
coming into the root system and have its
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxic events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, this was originally
described in wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, we describe it in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has nowadays been reported as a
very highly conserved mechanism throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole variety of crop species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, aluminum-resistance in plants
can be achieved by an exclusion mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the one I just described,
which is the release of organic acids into
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere, forming non-toxic
complexes, or true tolerance or
[SPEAKER_00]: detoxification mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If aluminum is able to get across the
plasma member of the root cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can form complexes with organic acids,
which are sequestered into the vacuole of
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots and stored there in a non-toxic
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in some cases, it can actually be
loaded into asylum, translocated into the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots where it's sequestered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the case of plants which are
aluminum hyperaccumulators, such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of tea crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the purpose of this talk,
all I'm focusing on is what I'm gonna talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about is aluminum exclusion mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, I'm gonna talk about
these two transporters, or the nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: these transporters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major breakthrough in terms of
understanding what was the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: identity of the transporters mediating
this release of organic acids came back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004, about 10 years ago, by Sasaki et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically cloned a novel
transporter, which they called
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum-activated melee transporter,
or ALMT, in wheat in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2007, Leon's group actually cloned the
second aluminum-atomic gene, and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: found out is there is an additional
transporter, or an additional family of
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cloned it for sorghum, and it's a
family of transporters from the
[SPEAKER_00]: multidrug-toxic compound extrusion family,
or MATES.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two transporters are very different
in terms of their secondary structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: their structure, and the way they
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are predominantly anion channel
transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is anion channel type of
transporters, while these are sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: antiporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of signal transduction,
it's a very complex network of signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction cascades, which basically the
aluminum stress is sensed, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of transcriptional regulation
going on, which ultimately affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of these two transporters,
the ALMTs and the MATES.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what I'm interested in talking
about today is how are these transporters
[SPEAKER_00]: actually post-translated, regulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, I'm not interested in
finding out what's the gene, at the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: level, what is the transcriptional
regulation of these transporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the protein itself, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it mediate the release of organic
acid, and can the protein actually respond
[SPEAKER_00]: by itself to the presence of extracellular
aluminum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna focus today on the ALMTs,
and I'll leave the MATES story for another
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wheat ALMT was cloned back in 2004,
and it said it was the first ALMT
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized at that time, and thus they
gave it the name of Aluminum-Active Malate
[SPEAKER_00]: Release Channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, we know that they're
expressing the root tips, and
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently, we and other groups were
involved in the cloning of amyloge genes
[SPEAKER_00]: to ALMT1, which these genes are,
in fact, involved in aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mediate the release of organic acids,
and they're associated with the aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, nowadays, we know that the ALMT
family is not just anion channels involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in aluminum resistance, but they're
involved in other physiological processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ALMTs that are expressed in
guard cells, so they're involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ALMTs that are expressed
in roots, and they are involved in mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and general uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a phylogenetic point of view,
from the genome, sequence projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to establish that the ALMT
family is pretty much divided into five
[SPEAKER_00]: different clades, with the set of aluminum
resistance-related ALMTs belonging to
[SPEAKER_00]: clade one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the only set of ALMTs thus
far that has been functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just based in genome sequencing
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a secondary structure point of view,
most ALMTs have a conserved structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which consists of the first half of the
protein contains about six transmembrane
[SPEAKER_00]: domains, with the other half of the
protein being more hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a half of the protein,
which is a highly hydrophilic region,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll talk later about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, given the similarity in the structure
of all these ALMTs, what we're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in finding out is, what makes a given ALMT
like this, an ALMT that is related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum-resistant phenotypes that we
observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there are some ALMTs that are
actually expressed in roots, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not related to the aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there must be something about this
particular set of ALMTs that allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: confer aluminum-resistant phenotype
implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for this purpose, what we've been
doing is, we've been doing structural and
[SPEAKER_00]: functional analysis, particularly of the
wheat ALMT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is, we use heterologous
expression in oocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can do is, we can express the
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can generate using conventional
molecular biology tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can generate different chimeras,
or single-point mutations, trications,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just express them in the oocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can generate cRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inject the cRNA into the oocyte cell,
which is about one millimeter in diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's really convenient in terms of
doing micro-injections.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells express the cRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They translate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They place your transporter in the cell,
and you can perform either functional
[SPEAKER_00]: studies using conventional
electrophysiological techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as two-electro-voltage clamp,
or you can do structural studies taking
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of different fluorochromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows us to do is perform the
functional and structural studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: set hypotheses in terms of we are
expecting in terms of the relation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to the function of these
transporters, and test our hypotheses by
[SPEAKER_00]: generating different versions,
or structurally modifying the ALMT,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing what its impact in the
functionality of that transport protein
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, giving the... Let me just take
you back one slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the fact that this ALMT mediates the
release of organic acids upon exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum, what we're interested to see
first was what's the interaction of
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum with the actual transporter,
and for that reason, the first step we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to take is to determine what is the
topology of the ALMT across the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this side facing the cytosolic side,
or is it facing the apoplasmic side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane in terms of which is the part of
the protein that first sees the aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences the presence of the AL3+.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to carry on the...
[SPEAKER_00]: The membrane topology studies of ALMT,
what we have developed is a technique
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have taken advantage of the pH
sensitivity of the GFP in such a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity of the fluorescence of the
emission of the GFP is pH dependent such
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you start hitting acidic pHs,
the emission of the GFP or the intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: squeds down, it's reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we first developed was a method
where we can monitor the intracellular pH
[SPEAKER_00]: of the oil site using a small pH
microelectrode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we impale those cells with the pH
microelectrode, and we establish a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular solutions which we perfuse
on the outside of the oil site and measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes in pH that occur internally in
the oil site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we change the extracellular pH from 7.5
through 7.5 plus sodium acetate or
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular pH of 5, we maintain a
relatively constant intracellular pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we put extracellular
solution of pH 5 plus sodium acetate,
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium acetate is a weak acid which
dissociates at pH 5, permeable bias is the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane of the oil site, gets inside and
yields this intracellular acidification of
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having established this methodology,
we look at what's the change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative fluorescence of the GFP through
this set of solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm showing you here is a
confocal image of the edge of the oil site
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's being bathed through this
different set of solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 7.5, is it running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the intensity of the GFP doesn't
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we put in 5.0 plus sodium
acetate, what we obtain is a quenching of
[SPEAKER_00]: the GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a nice system where we can
correlate changes in the intensity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP with changes in the intracellular pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use that as an indicator of
potentially where is the GFP found.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, obviously, the soluble GFP
is found in the intracellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same with a particular
transporter, AT mate, by tagging it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: N terminus with the GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we obtained is a similar pattern
to that described with the soluble GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the N terminus domain of the
AT mate is located in the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a good indication that our
technique is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we use a negative control using OPT3,
a transporter that we heard about early
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, a talk given by Elena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tagged it at the C terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the C terminus of that
transporter is located to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as you would expect, when you
bath it through the different set of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions we have, there's no change in
the first two solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as there's pH 5 in the
extracellular space, we quench the GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a nice system to show,
to basically use the GFP as an indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: of is that particular N terminus or C
terminus located to the intracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: space or the apoplasmic phase of the
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this approach, we took our gene of
interest, the wheat LMT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first tagged it in the N terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we obtained is pretty much the
similar behavior to what we obtained for
[SPEAKER_00]: the soluble GFP, indicating that this
particular GFP here is facing or is
[SPEAKER_00]: located in the intracellular space of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken the same approach with
transporters tagged at the C terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the C terminus is actually
located into the inside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the end of the transmembrane
domain 6 is also located to the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some controversy about the
potential existence of additional
[SPEAKER_00]: transmembrane domains around this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is we've taken the GFP
and we've flanked those different
[SPEAKER_00]: transmembrane domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the GFP is located
towards the inside, indicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no transmembrane domain region
there, even though it might be a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be involved in the anchoring of
the protein, rather than actually
[SPEAKER_00]: constituting a domain which transverses
the lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having established the topology of the
protein, the next thing we're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in understanding is how does the protein
assemble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the channel work as a single subunit,
so one single subunit of ALMT is
[SPEAKER_00]: functionally active, or does it assemble
as a multimeric transporter in such a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you require the assembly of several
subunits to form the actual functional
[SPEAKER_00]: channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, we have used BIFC,
pretty much a well-established technique
[SPEAKER_00]: by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tagged the subunits of ALMT with the
two complementary halves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tagged the halves of the YFP,
and what we get is complementation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: YFP at the plasma membrane, indicating
that the ALMT subunits are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also tagged the subunits in opposite
directions, with half of the YFP attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end, the other half attached to the
C-terminus, and we also obtained
[SPEAKER_00]: complementation, suggesting, once again,
that the C-terminus and the N-terminus are
[SPEAKER_00]: facing in the same compartment,
the cytoplasm of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the ALMT subunits
interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we were wondering is what's
the stoichiometry of ALMT?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are two subunits interacting,
or is the transporter consisting of three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four subunits interacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, we're collaborating with
the Isikov Lab in UC Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they use is they use turf
microscopy to address this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step we had to do was prove
that their technique actually is suitable
[SPEAKER_00]: for studying plant membrane transporters,
not just suitable for studying animal
[SPEAKER_00]: channel transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we tagged CAT1 with a
GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAT1 is a potassium channel from
Arabidopsis, and there's good knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: about the structure and the assembly of
this type of potassium channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've shown is that the functional
properties of the intact CAT1 resemble
[SPEAKER_00]: those of the CAT tagged with a GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the addition of the GFP is not
affecting the functionality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we express that transporter in all
sites and in a low density, under the turf
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, what you can observe is
actually single GFP molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being photobleached, single GFP molecule
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look in detail to a particular
set of those single spots, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show you, I want to focus on this
red region here, what we can do is we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually measure the changes in intensity
that take place in that particular spot as
[SPEAKER_00]: the GFP is being quenched by the laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we get is a high
intensity point, and as the GFP is being
[SPEAKER_00]: bleached, you lose the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's being quantified here
over a period of about 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you see is that the change in
intensity actually occurs in four very
[SPEAKER_00]: discrete steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a continuous behavior,
but you have four different steps or
[SPEAKER_00]: discrete changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is telling you is that you
actually have four GFP molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: emitting in that particular spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four GFP molecules, each one attached to
one of the subunits of CAT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, what that's telling is in
every single spot that you look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're finding is CAT1 assemble as a
tetramer, consisting of the four subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what actually forms the
functional transporter of CAT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four subunits assemble in such a way that
this region in the middle actually
[SPEAKER_00]: consists of the permeation pathway or the
pore of the transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that we can actually use this
technique for plant cells, what we did is
[SPEAKER_00]: we implemented it for the ALMT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other ALMTs, and what we obtained is
that the transporters actually assemble as
[SPEAKER_00]: a dimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the functional state of the
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this for not only the wheat
ALMT, we know that it also happens for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis, for the maize ALMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently the dimer state is conserved
throughout the entire ALMT family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've shown you so far,
is those structural studies that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, basically just coming out from a
secondary structure, we're able to know
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less the topology of the ALMT
across the membrane, which part faces the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, which part faces the
extracellular side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it assembles as a dimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're interested in finding out
are what are the functional properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: this ALMT, and how do those functional
properties correlate with the structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that purpose, once again,
what we're doing is we're expressing our
[SPEAKER_00]: protein of interest in the oocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to load the oocytes with the
substrate, in this case, malate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We microinject the cells with malate a
couple of hours prior to doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophysiological recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use two-electro voltage clamp to
study the activity of that transporter
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed across the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put it in simple terms, what we do is
the cell is so big, it's one millimeter in
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter, we're able to impale two
microelectrodes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one microelectrode, we are able to
impose a voltage across the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the other microelectrode,
what we're able to do is we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: record the currents that are elicited or
that happen at that particular holding
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those currents are simply the movement of
ions across the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: A current is just the transport of ions
across the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you what happens in control
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: By control cells, I mean cells that have
not been injected with the RNAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are not expressing the transporter,
versus what happens with cells that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been injected with the ALMT transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing you a holding
potential of minus 100 millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the magnitude of the current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it just relates to the amount of
transport that's taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control cells show a very small current,
very basal endogenous transport taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place across the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ALMTs, in the absence of aluminum,
mediated a slightly larger transport in
[SPEAKER_00]: those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's really important is that
upon just adding aluminum to the bath,
[SPEAKER_00]: so basically you replace the bath medium
for the same solution, but now it includes
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 micromolar aluminum chloride,
what you get is a very relatively quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: it happens within a couple of minutes,
a very quick enhancement of the transport
[SPEAKER_00]: activity mediated by aluminum,
by ALMT, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, basically we have a transporter
that is not at the regulatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not at the transcription level,
but actually just happens within minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the transporter somehow is
sensing the presence of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that aluminum interacts with the
transporter changes the conformation state
[SPEAKER_00]: and it surrenders the transporter in a
more active state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another way of looking at the
transport activity of ALMTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than holding the membrane
potential for a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do is we can just look at the
transport activity over a small period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time of about 600 milliseconds at a given
voltage, say minus 140 millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure the magnitude of the transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that particular voltage, and then we
just keep changing the holding potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to smaller and smaller, less negative
holding potentials, and we keep measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: the transport activity at those particular
voltages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, these are just traces
superimposed, or current magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: superimposed at different holding
potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, control cells show a very
small transport activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have some transport activity,
and it's obvious it's the transport
[SPEAKER_00]: activity from the endogenous transporters
of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you express ALMT, you obtain a
magnitude of transport much higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is mediated by this transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, when you expose them
to aluminum, to extracellular aluminum,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you obtain is once again an
enhancement of the transport activity
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated by the ALMT1 channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into the biophysics of
it, but basically we can perform our sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of analysis based on the magnitudes of
this current and the different voltages
[SPEAKER_00]: and substrates that we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to summarize is that we do
know that the ALMT1, one, as I showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is enhanced by the presence of
extracellular aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, it mediates negative currents,
which are actually the product of malate
[SPEAKER_00]: moving from the inside of the cell into
the outside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a transporter that mediates
organic acid release, just like you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect it in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, it responds to the
presence of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in finding out what is
it that determines that aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all I'm going to talk about
for the rest of the talk, and it's what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the motifs or what are the parts of
the protein that are actually responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for sensing the aluminum in the
extracellular phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have been doing is we have no
structural knowledge of the ALMT,
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from secondary structure prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken, originally we took a crude
approach, which is we started looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: truncations of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started by removing the terminal 19
amino acids, and we expressed that
[SPEAKER_00]: truncated version of the protein into all
sites, and we compared the transport
[SPEAKER_00]: properties relative to the unmodified
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you truncate the last 19 amino
acids, basically you get a transporter
[SPEAKER_00]: where the transport properties are not
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is true if we remove up to
residue 435, so basically expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first 435 residues, including these
transmembrane domains, plus part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: C-tail results in a transporter that is
functionally active.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we remove five amino acids
more from the terminal region,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we obtain is a transport that is no
longer functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lost the activity of the
transporter, both the basal activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the transporter, and obviously as well as
the enhanceability feature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the transporter is being
targeted to the plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's something about the folding
that has been lost that surrenders the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter nonfunctional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, when you keep doing more
truncations around the C-terminal domain,
[SPEAKER_00]: we obtain transporters that are basically
nonfunctional.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was surprising was, upon removal of
the entire C-terminal domain, that long
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophilic tail, what we obtain is a
transporter that recovers its
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just the N-terminus domain being
expressed being functional, it cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced or it's not responsive to the
presence of extracellular aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that is telling us is the
N-terminus domain, this first half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, underlies the permeation pathway,
which is not surprising seeing that it
[SPEAKER_00]: contains the transmembrane domains,
forming the pore where the ions are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to flow through across the bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, is this C-terminal
domain, we know that it's not essential
[SPEAKER_00]: for protein functioning, but is it
actually a domain that determines the
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum enhanceability of the protein?
[SPEAKER_00]: So,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we express the LMT, we're able to
calculate a Km for the aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanceability of the transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's concentration-dependent,
and around 5 micromolar, we're able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% maximum activation or enhancement of
the transport activity of the LMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is telling us is that that high
affinity, what it suggests is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum being Al3+, most likely is
binding to negatively charged residues in
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: G, we're measuring the conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we look at the relationship
between voltage and current, and the slope
[SPEAKER_00]: of that relationship should tell you what
the conductance or the transport rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the transporter would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically the conductance we
obtain at a given aluminum activity over
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum conductance we're able to
obtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that suggests is that Al3+,
is most likely binding to negative
[SPEAKER_00]: residues in the transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to evaluate the role of the C-terminus
of the LMT, what we did is we started
[SPEAKER_00]: neutralizing every single amino acid
negative residue in the C-terminus of the
[SPEAKER_00]: LMT by changing aspartic acid either to
asparagine or glutamic acid changing into
[SPEAKER_00]: glutamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we're neutralizing each one
of those residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take each one of those single-point
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We express them in all sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we compare the influence or the
potential change in the functionality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the transporter relative to the
non-modified transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data I'll be showing you is just in
regards to the response of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woopa.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're somewhere around there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm going to be talking about is
the changes in aluminum responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does the responsiveness of each
one of these transporters changes relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to a wild type, which we're calling 100%
responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see is we obtain a whole
variety of phenotypes in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of enhancement, which goes from
transporters that are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, most of the single mutations
or most of the neutralizations result in
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters with lower responsiveness,
with a couple or a few transporters that
[SPEAKER_00]: have actually lost their responsiveness to
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of presenting that data is
this way in terms of the magnitude of the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just to highlight that it's
not a discrete response, but it's rather a
[SPEAKER_00]: very continuous response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are interesting residues like
274, 275, and 423, where we have actually
[SPEAKER_00]: lost the responsiveness of the
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very tempting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the Japanese group proposed
it initially to say, well, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: identified the residues where aluminum is
binding to the LMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we neutralize them,
aluminum can no longer bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can no longer bind to the LMT,
thus it's no longer responsive to
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we know that that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the distribution of those
particular residues throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 or so sequences so far known for the
LMTs, what we see is that residues like
[SPEAKER_00]: 274, 275 or residues like 423 are actually
highly conserved or entirely conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire LMT family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of this sequence includes LMTs
which are not related to the aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think is happening is among
these residues, we have identified
[SPEAKER_00]: residues or we have mutated residues which
are highly conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're required for protein stability
and proper functioning as a overall LMT
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually have nothing to do with
the aluminum binding to the transporter or
[SPEAKER_00]: with the phenotype of aluminum
responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prove this hypothesis, what we did is
we looked for highly conserved residues
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire family, residues
which are not negatively charged such as
[SPEAKER_00]: the tryptophan here, tryptophan 283.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've done is we've done a single
point substitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that residue as well as the residue 218
or 431.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what we show is if you're
able to substitute those highly conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: residues, what you end up with is a series
of transporters that are no longer as
[SPEAKER_00]: functional as the original LMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we do believe that this
negative residues we identified originally
[SPEAKER_00]: are more involved in overall protein
stability, folding and functionality
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than they having something to do
with the aluminum responsiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question we wanted to address
was, can we move then the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: C-terminus block?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire C-terminus block is the one
responsible for the aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have characterized several LMTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aluminum-enhanceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the homolog in Arabidopsis is
also aluminum-enhanceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the MACE, ALMT1 is not
aluminum-enhanceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is we've swapped the
domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we take the N-terminus of this
transporter and we attach the N-terminus
[SPEAKER_00]: of this transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can take the N-terminus of this
transporter and attach the C-terminus of
[SPEAKER_00]: this transporter resulting in the swap
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that way, we've generated six different
swap domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We express these contracts in all sites
and we look at the changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize all that data in a
very colorful way, here I'm showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: once again the LMTs which are responsive
and the LMTs which is not responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the C-terminal region of the
responsive LMTs and you attach them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: N-terminus of a non-responsive LMT,
what you obtain is no aluminum enhancement
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the C-block moved to a pore of a
different transporter is not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance the transport activity of that
LMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, if you take the C-terminus from
the non-responsive one and you place it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the N-terminus pore region of the two
of the wheat and the Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you obtain is actually an enhancement
of the transport activity which was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzling as we thought that the N-terminus
domain was not involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, when you swap them among the two
responsive ones, what you get is in some
[SPEAKER_00]: instances it's able to recover and the
other construct is not able to recover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is telling us is that the nature
of the N-terminus domain which we had
[SPEAKER_00]: discarded originally is actually a
determinant of aluminum enhanceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to look at the N-term domain
in terms of the potential negative
[SPEAKER_00]: residues associated with that protein
region and once again we performed single
[SPEAKER_00]: point mutations and we looked at the
changes in phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again we obtained a very continuous
changes in phenotype relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obtained several residues which
basically surrendered the transporter in a
[SPEAKER_00]: state where it's no longer enhanced by
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot mentioning that all the single
point mutations that we've done actually
[SPEAKER_00]: result in transporters which are
functionally active.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mediate the basal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What varies is their degree of aluminum
responsiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once again when you look at this
at the residues, at this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: residues, what we find is they are highly
conserved throughout the entire LNT
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting once again we cannot
attribute a role to these residues to the
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum responsiveness of the protein but
rather we think they're involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: overall functioning and stability of the
LNT family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is it all lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a lot of single point mutation
analysis that led us nowhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far what I showed you is how we tried
to correlate the changes in a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: residue with the distribution throughout
the entire family based on sequences from
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we tried to look, the question we
posed was okay let's take a look at what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening here in terms of the
functionality but are we able to find any
[SPEAKER_00]: domain on the set of ALMTs that have been
functionally characterized?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three ALMTs that we know are
responsive to aluminum and we have a set
[SPEAKER_00]: of ALMTs that are not responsive to
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we find in sequence alignments any
particular domain that might be unique to
[SPEAKER_00]: this set of ALMTs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we ended up finding is a motif right
at the beginning of the protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the end of the N-term,
we found a motif that is associated and is
[SPEAKER_00]: found uniquely in this set of ALMTs which
are aluminum responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the motif looks is
basically a highly conserved region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first 12 amino acids with a variable
region between 2 and up to 35 residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most interesting, now we're walking back
to the phylogenetic analysis and we say
[SPEAKER_00]: okay let's look through all the
phylogenetic, through the 400 sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been available at the moment and
see how this identified motif is present
[SPEAKER_00]: in these clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is that out of the 403
sequences we find 17 sequences that
[SPEAKER_00]: contain this motif and interestingly that
motif is only contained in sequences that
[SPEAKER_00]: belong to clade 1 which is the clade which
accounts for this particular transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything seems to indicate that this
motif might be associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum responsiveness of ALMT and this
is current work that we're performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lab what we've done is we have
removed that 35 amino acid motif and we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the ALMT upon removing this
motif is no longer functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's functional but it's no longer
responsive to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: However if we remove the terminal 8 amino
acids we know that the ALMT is still
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still looking into, we're trying
to dissect which of this entire motif
[SPEAKER_00]: actually corresponds to the part or
contains the part that makes the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible and that's what we're
evaluating at the moment, a whole series
[SPEAKER_00]: of deletions of this motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also what we're testing is we're taking
that motif and we're doing a swap domain
[SPEAKER_00]: on an ALMT which is not aluminum
responsive to see if insertion of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular motif at the N terminus will
bring back the responsiveness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall summarizing what I've shown you
is we started with a secondary prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ALMTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some topological work and some
turf work indicating they assemble as
[SPEAKER_00]: dimers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the topology is such that both the
N and the C domains are contained to the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's still puzzling is if aluminum is
interacting with the protein, how come
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interacting with domains which are
contained within the inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the speciation of aluminum is such that
at neutral pHs, aluminum precipitates as
[SPEAKER_00]: say hydroxide, how come aluminum might be
getting into the cell and interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: motifs located in a region which is
basically neutral pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think is we have identified
regions which are involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: structural changes that take place
underlying the enhanceability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the regions we have identified
are not necessarily the regions where
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum is interacting directly with the
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this has been done with any real
structural knowledge of the ALMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just done it with secondary
structure predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are in urge, we need to get a
crystal structure that allow us to place a
[SPEAKER_00]: spatial structure, a crystal structure,
a 3D model of the ALMTs to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap all the functionality that we
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically to elucidate what are the
molecular determinants of the
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality of the ALMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part that I never told you about
is the other family of transporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mate transporters, which is a complete
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're regulated in a different way and
hopefully one day I'll get the chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically summarizing, I've shown you a
set of multidisciplinary approaches that
[SPEAKER_00]: have allowed us to initiate function
structure analysis of membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are involved or mediate a particular
abiotic stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This knowledge will allow us to
potentially identify the allele of
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane transporters that are most
effective in conferring aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the era of genome editing,
it's pretty plausible to propose that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able with the knowledge of what
are the domains that mediate aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement in a particular region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, I just want to acknowledge a
lot of people that have been involved at
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the old timers in the
coaching lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the technical help and the
intellectual discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly I want to acknowledge people
from my group, Allison, Ayalu,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Armand, who have carried part of the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as visiting scholars,
international visiting scholars,
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating students from plant biology that
have collaborated and added little bits
[SPEAKER_00]: and pieces to the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as undergrads who have rotated
during the summer through the plant genome
[SPEAKER_00]: research project that BTI hosts over the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also collaborators, Ingo, Ed, they're
involved in the phylogenetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, Ed is involved in the turf
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey Chang is our right hand man in
regards to the structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: crystallization of transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dave Snoddy and Kuda are involved in
other work that I haven't presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally want to acknowledge the funding
from what used to be NRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays it's the NIFA grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you estimated the single channel
conductance from ALE?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the expression of ALE Ts,
I haven't done any single channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I looked at your turf,
so you have some channel density that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can estimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from your IV curves, I guess it's a
trillion melees of oenine per second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if you could maybe estimate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do the correlation, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any single channel work
from experiments to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they are not familiar,
basically single channel is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually isolate a little patch of the
membrane to measure the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecule of that transfer and
measure the transfer rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did do was back in the 2000s we
did a lot of hatch mapping, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: transport activity of protoclasts from
maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that we characterized an anion
current, which basically accounts for the
[SPEAKER_00]: release of intracellular anions into the
extracellular part of the protoclast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did single channel work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was a conductance of
around 20 to 30 people sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those ionic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that that channel,
isolated in patches, also was dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of extracellular aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the patch is quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remove aluminum, as soon as you
bring aluminum, the single channel
[SPEAKER_00]: activity appears, which is consistent with
the activity of ALE Ts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I haven't done any single channel
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any estimates of the channel
density from the turf?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious, getting a crystal
structure obviously would be a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to this, but in lieu of that,
if you look to see whether that interminal
[SPEAKER_01]: domain that you've identified is
potentially being some involvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum, are there similar structures in
other transport proteins involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: cation binding that could give you some
clues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for that particular domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something unique about that
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's pretty frustrating to work with
these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work like for maids, you just
simply put your sequence out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get three, four different crystal
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you have to do is take your
sequence, thread it through those crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: structures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through those predictions, you get a nice
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw it in the teeth, you get
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop it in half, you throw it just in the
interval domains, you get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a family, unique, unique to the
client kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the more reason to get the crystal
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the more reason to get the crystal
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are a couple of substitutions,
at least for the weak one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had proposed for work in all sites
that there was a functional difference
[SPEAKER_00]: among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have done the work, and basically
we're trying to work with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would be nice to have a change of
people type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are no more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
