[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as was mentioned, I just recently
started my assistant professorship at Penn
[SPEAKER_01]: State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all this work that I'll be telling
you about is all work that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: previously at the University of Arizona,
but will be continuing on in my new
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be looking at the causes and
consequences of antagonism among different
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates or different strains of
Pseudomonas stringii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be focusing in on this molecule
here that I'll be telling you more about
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, there's a lot of people that
have been interested in this field of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about plant associated microbial
communities and the different factors that
[SPEAKER_01]: influence these communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, these have a number of effects
for plant health and production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to explain that in detail for
this crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been a number of things that
have been, over the past decades,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been understood in terms of
plant host being important, which organ
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at, or even more recently,
what the plant genotype is in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: determining what the microbiome for the
plant is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, there's also been this
understanding that the other microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: members that are present are helping
structure the community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really where my interest
focuses, is understanding the interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: that are occurring between these resident
microbes within the plant environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my research questions really focus
on how do microbial interactions affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the ecology and evolution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these associated microbes, what are the
genetic bases of these interactions?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I focus, or where I come
from, from a very molecular genetic and
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular biology background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always interested in what the
mechanisms of these interactions are.
[SPEAKER_01]: How these interactions are then going to
influence downstream plant microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, as was alluded to,
how can we exploit these interactions for,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, pathogen control or stimulating
communities that are going to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: plant health and productivity?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the purpose of today, we're just
going to focus on these two areas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people here are very
familiar with Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't belabor it too much, but it's a
ubiquitous phytopathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over 50 or 60 different pathogens
now that have been described.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a species, it can infect a wide
range of host crops or host species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we think about the phases of
bacterial host interaction, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of work, a lot of great work done here
thinking about the pathogen once it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and sort of the interaction between
the microbe and its host plant at the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from the background coming out of
Steve's lab at Berkeley, where the focus
[SPEAKER_01]: was a little bit more on understanding the
microbes as they're existing on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are the stressors that they
encounter there, and how do they survive
[SPEAKER_01]: there so that they can build up a sizable
enough population that ingress into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that things like acquiring
nutrients, evading desiccation stress or
[SPEAKER_01]: desiccation tolerance, as well as
tolerating UV exposure are all major
[SPEAKER_01]: factors for bacteria living in this
environment that they have to tolerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about the microbes then
on the leaf surface, one thing is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to realize or keep in mind is that
they're found in aggregates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not spread evenly across the
leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that these aggregates tend to
associate with particular anatomical
[SPEAKER_01]: features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the base of glandular trichomes are in
the intracellular grooves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this glandular trichome here,
we have a large aggregate of bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: cells here forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of reasons why we
think these aggregates form at these
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is the data seems to
suggest that these are really where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting leakage of water and nutrients
from the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interior onto the exterior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is where the bacteria are
actually going to make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we think about these microbes
fighting for finite resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, there's going to be
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so much space and only so
much nutrients that are leaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think about, we know that
there's a number of different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a species, there's a great,
especially for syringe, there can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: great diversity of different strains that
are inhabiting the same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think about them potentially
interfering with each other's ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this could either be through acquiring
resources more effectively than the other
[SPEAKER_01]: member.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that I'll be telling you
about today focuses more specifically on
[SPEAKER_01]: antimicrobial mediated antagonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, this class of compounds
here referred to collectively as
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a large group of different
proteinaceous compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think of them essentially as
highly specific antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with an antibiotic, you would expect
that most all members within a given
[SPEAKER_01]: species, if that species is sensitive to
the antibiotic, most all the members will
[SPEAKER_01]: be sensitive to that same antibiotic,
except for those that have a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: For these systems, it's quite the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because one strain of the species is
sensitive to a given bacteriosome,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason to expect another strain
will also be sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a high degree of
specificity, again, and they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: protein-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is another thing that
separates them from traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little bit of a renaissance
within this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's a number of groups
that have started to become interested,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just within syringes, but within other
pseudomonads, other environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudomonads as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the literature from
about the mid-60s through the early 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was also a number of groups at this
time looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anvidiverse group in particular is one
that I'm just highlighting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bacteriosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, all of the tools or all
of the questions that were being asked
[SPEAKER_01]: were using bacteriosomes basically for
species delimitation as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: epidemiological markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the tools available at that
time didn't allow for really in-detail
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis of the particular bacteriosomes
being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the field shifted away from this
into a number of different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is sort of something that,
again, had been looked at, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still a number of very relevant and
important questions that need to be asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the three things that I'll tell you
about today is the genetics of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriosome production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all, again, within pseudomonas
syringae, as well as some of the work on
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics of sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of our hint as to what
potential ecological role these actually
[SPEAKER_01]: may be playing in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, to screen for bacteriosomes,
it's very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have your strain growing up in a
broth culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add some chemical inductant,
or you just let it grow long enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventually the cells in there will
lyse and release the killing agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, the bacteriosome,
into the supernatant, filter sterilize,
[SPEAKER_01]: pellet the cells, and then just you have
the sterile supernatant here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you spot this onto a lawn of
recipient bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this case, the donor strain is
going to be one pseudomonas syringae,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, probably pathovar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of these recipient strains,
again, are going to be different strains
[SPEAKER_01]: of syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you would expect, if you just had a
medium and you spotted on sterile media,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't get any inhibition of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the supernatant containing the
bacteriosome and a strain that's
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive, you'll get a very defined
killing zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, you can have the same
supernatant on an alternative strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you won't see any inhibition
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were the original 18 strains that
I selected for screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this represents a fair amount of the
diversity within pseudomonas syringae,
[SPEAKER_01]: although there's many more environmental
strains and other filer groups now that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is showing just the cladogram
of their relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these columns are going to
indicate where the activity is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm spotting all by all,
all of the columns are going to indicate
[SPEAKER_01]: where the activity is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the producers, and these are
the sensitive strains being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where there's a white box,
that'll indicate killing activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a black box will indicate no activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you can see is that
there's actually quite a diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: killing activity among these different
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, you can see that there are
certain patterns, like T1 and Lacrimans
[SPEAKER_01]: 106 up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very similar killing spectra,
and it's also very similar to CIT7 or PTA
[SPEAKER_01]: down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are not very closely related,
but they seem to have the same killing
[SPEAKER_01]: spectra or very closely related killing
spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this indicates there's a high amount of
genetic diversity underlying this
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype within the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, my interest really
stems from the genetics underlying this
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for that, I went in and focused on
B728A.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a workhorse in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some time, and this is also a holdover
from my graduate work that I'm most
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with, with this particular
strain, and trying to understand what were
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic determinants for its killing
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a complete genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's online databases that you can feed
the genome into, and it'll predict most
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the bacteriocins that are encoded
within a given genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it predicted these two different
bacteriocins here, and these are just
[SPEAKER_01]: their locusts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're related to E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli bacteriocin, so they're single
proteins, and they have a characteristic
[SPEAKER_01]: catalytic domain and a characteristic
immunity protein that protects the
[SPEAKER_01]: producing strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're very easy to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when I deleted both of these
individually, there was no loss of killing
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I stacked the deletion,
there was still no loss of killing
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this led to the idea that,
of course, there's some other source for
[SPEAKER_01]: this killing activity, and where is it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing some literature searches as well
as some more genome gazing, I happened
[SPEAKER_01]: upon another area, and this was just a
regulator that I thought might be
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, deleting it,
I abolished all of the killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is located in this region that
was originally described as a prophage
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the regulator I deleted,
or the pair of regulators were here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then downstream was this annotated
prophage region that's actually conserved
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Pseudomonas strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's within this larger, or it's
flanked by these two, what I use as mile
[SPEAKER_01]: markers, TRIP-E and TRIP-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically interrupted the
tryptophan biosynthetic operon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this regulator led to loss of
killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a sense that maybe this
prophage region was involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: killing activity, but of course,
this could be regulating many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to remind ourselves, when we're
talking about prophages, most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: very familiar with this, but just to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the bacteriophage, for temperate
bacteriophages, we think of them as having
[SPEAKER_01]: these two different life cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The characteristic one where it injects
its host cell, or sorry, its genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: into the host cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genome's replicated, the genes are
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This leads to formation of new virions
that are then released into the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, and we have virus
replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the alternative pathway where once
the genome's injected, injected into the
[SPEAKER_01]: host cell, it actually integrates into the
host cell genome and is maintained there
[SPEAKER_01]: in a quiescent state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's replicating as long as the
cell's replicating, and at some point,
[SPEAKER_01]: this will become induced to exit back out
and go back into the lytic replication
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this region that I found looked
like an integrated bacteriophage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, deleted the regulator,
and we're anticipating that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating the rest of the genes for the
bacteriophage, and then complement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also deleted the genes that made up the
tail structure of the bacteriophage,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the receptor binding proteins,
and these are the parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriophage that are critical for
interacting with its host cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could be complemented as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deletion of the regulator, killing goes
away, it's complemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deletion of the tail genes also abolishes
the killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a large region that I didn't
wanna, it was about 10 kb, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna take the time to complement it,
because it would have been a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then just focusing on the receptor
binding proteins, I also lose killing
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, and this is complemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can say now that this predicted
prophage encodes a bacteriophage-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriocin, or what we commonly just
refer to as a tailocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as Melanie had actually alluded to,
her work looking at the pyocins of
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudomonas aeruginosa, so these have been
studied for a long time, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four decades, if not longer, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since the B728A genome, and there had
been a number of stringy genomes that had
[SPEAKER_01]: been sequenced, and we had the aeruginosa
genomes, and there had been a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic comparisons, but there had never
been a description of a tailocin encoded
[SPEAKER_01]: within the genomes of the strains that I
was looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It led to this question, why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we've had this information,
and we would think that if it was just one
[SPEAKER_01]: co-option of one bacteriophage for this,
that we would have seen it in the genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the question is, are these
derived from the same progenitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at the genomic sequence,
they're actually located in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in aeruginosa, just again,
the mile markers, TRIP-E and TRIP-G,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same region for pseudomonas
stringy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we compare the nucleotide
identity across this region, we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: that the conserved bacterial genes indeed
are conserved, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We think they're vertically inherited,
but there's no nucleotide or protein
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence similarity at all between these
two tailocin regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems the answer seems to be that
no, these are derived from independent
[SPEAKER_01]: progenitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to wrap that up, we did some
biogenetic inference comparing these two
[SPEAKER_01]: tailocins to their progenitor
bacteriophages to see if they were
[SPEAKER_01]: clustering similarly to each other or with
different bacteriophages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, that's what we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we see pseudomonas stringy and all
of the isolates up here are most closely
[SPEAKER_01]: related to either phage mu or phage SFV
for this particular protein, whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudomonas aeruginosa is clustering with
phage P2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this for all three of the genes
that we actually had a reasonable amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of alignment that we could rely on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the other genes that are present,
you can't align them, so you can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: these sorts of analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so then the conclusion is these are
in fact derived independently of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have really any nucleotide or
protein sequence identity to speak of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're clustering with distant
bacteriophages.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bacteriophages are related to each
other, but people who work on
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriophages know them to be very
distinct from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this means that there's been
multiple levels of convergence that's
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we have the centenic convergence
and that both of these tailosins are
[SPEAKER_01]: ending up in the same genomic region in
these two hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the phenotypic convergence
where we're going from a bacteriophage to
[SPEAKER_01]: a bacteriocin or to a tailosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this would also suggest that
there's going to be some molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: convergence as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just very grossly looking at this
structure for the myoviridae, so these are
[SPEAKER_01]: tailed bacteriophages that have a double
strand DNA genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the head or the capsid associated
or attached to that as the tail,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at the distal end again are the
tail fibers or the receptor binding
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what it would look like
with TEM.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we compare the genes that are
conserved here within the tailosin region
[SPEAKER_01]: for, this is B728A, back to SFV or phage
mu and just focus on phage mu up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see that only the genes
corresponding to the tail region are
[SPEAKER_01]: retained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the genes necessary for regulation,
capsid morphogenesis and such have been
[SPEAKER_01]: lost from the phage mu genome in this
tailosin region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was something that had already
been understood to occur with the tailosin
[SPEAKER_01]: for Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can see that we have the similar
loss of genes between these two systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you go from a bona fide
bacteriophage to this structure here where
[SPEAKER_01]: again, now you can see it's just the tail,
there's no head or capsid associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: this structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how we think these are working,
borrowing from the literature for
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, if you look at the
outer membrane, right, for gram-negative
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, the tail fibers interact with a
cell surface receptor on the outer
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane, the tail contracts, drives this
core structure through the outer membrane
[SPEAKER_01]: and into the inner membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to deliver the phage
genome to the host cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a genome to deliver
though, and we think there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptations as well, but a big part of
this is you don't have a genome to
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver, so you're basically an open end
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still is going to contract,
it's going to drive the core through the
[SPEAKER_01]: outer membrane and into the inner
membrane, but at this point it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to depolarization rather than phage
delivery, or sorry, genome delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we can imagine with these tail
fibers, since it's known from the work
[SPEAKER_01]: with bacteriophages that these are
important for interacting with the host
[SPEAKER_01]: cells, this is a great target then for
starting to think about the specificity
[SPEAKER_01]: between a given talicin and the cells that
are, or the strains that are targeted by
[SPEAKER_01]: that talicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we look at this region across a
number of different strains, we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: that the receptor binding protein itself
tends to be the most divergent,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so this region here of sequence
similarity would extend for about 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_01]: kilobases upstream, which are all the core
components of the talicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the receptor binding protein and
its associated chaperone, there seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot of evolution recombination that's
occurring in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we engineer retargeting in this
way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for PJA pathovar japonica, it is not
natively able to kill pathovar actinidia
[SPEAKER_01]: or pathovar glycinea, as I'm showing up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I just take those two genes,
the receptor binding protein and the
[SPEAKER_01]: associated chaperone, from B728A and
express it in japonica without anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else, I can now retarget it to kill these
two strains because B728A natively kills
[SPEAKER_01]: those two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've done this for a number of
different strains, and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: activity is transferable from PJA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it with B728A as well,
and then these other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically everywhere where I've looked,
I don't anticipate all of this activity is
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from the talicin, but it seems
like that's the majority of the killing
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, because I have some evidence,
and I'll show you that in a second,
[SPEAKER_01]: of what some of these other bacteriocins
may be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these killing spectra are
readily modifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so now shifting to, we have
essentially the key in this scenario,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the lock?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about the host cell that's also
determining the specificity?
[SPEAKER_01]: We focused in early on on
lipopolysaccharide, and we had a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons for doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, all of the bacteriophages that these
talicins are related to, they all target
[SPEAKER_01]: LPS, and most people are familiar with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a major component of the
gram-negative outer membrane, where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got this lipid portion here that's
embedded in the outer membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another portion of the core
oligosaccharide that does vary a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but tends not to vary very
significantly among strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the highly divergent O-specific,
or the O-antigen component that's highly
[SPEAKER_01]: variable among strains, even within a
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, this is a known
receptor for the bacteriophages that the
[SPEAKER_01]: talicins are derived from, but also,
as you would expect, for the pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: aeruginosa talicin as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we received a number of strains from
Matt Templeton's group in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he had characterized LPS mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are all transposon insertion
mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm showing up here at the top,
we have wild-type LPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the wild-type strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these are two strains that have a
transposon insertion, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with LPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see that the killing activity
for this strain is talicin-derived,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the structural mutant and the
receptor-binding protein mutant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they lose all of their killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have killing for these LPS
mutants down here for the wild-type,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we would expect that if the LPS is the
receptor that we wouldn't have seen any
[SPEAKER_01]: killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's two things that you can
see right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is that these killing zones are
phenotypically distinguishable from these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these have a very sharp edge,
which is characteristic of a talicin
[SPEAKER_01]: killing, because it's a big, bulky
structure that cannot diffuse efficiently
[SPEAKER_01]: through the auger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas for other compounds, like smaller
single-protein bacteriocins, they're much
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller, and so they can diffuse through
the auger matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get this diffuse killing
zone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other bit of evidence that showed
that it's clearly not the talicin is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the talicin-deletion mutants, we still had
the same killing activity recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this indicates that there's
actually some other source of the killing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I had shown before, the deletion
of this particular bacteriocin doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the killing of the wild-type
strains with the wild-type LPS deletion
[SPEAKER_01]: complement, and then the mock complement.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, now with these LPS mutants,
we can see that by deleting this
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative bacteriocin, all of the
killing activity is abolished,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is all complementable as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a genetic distinction here
between the killing activities,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we can also distinguish them
physically as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by doing a step of page precipitation,
it's just a simple method where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: separate bulky, high-molecular-weight
molecules from smaller-molecular-weight
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very efficient for recovering,
and it was developed as a technique in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriophage field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that we can recover all of the
talicin-mediated killing activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the two mutants complemented mutant,
and then a mock complement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the killing activity against
the LPS mutants was completely lost and
[SPEAKER_01]: not recoverable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really interesting,
and it's something actually that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to my knowledge, has not been reported on
within the bacteriocin field, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that gaining resistance to one talicin led
to sensitivity of the other talicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just, not only is there
redundancy here, but it's conditional
[SPEAKER_01]: redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they're both killing at the
same time, but one has to be sensitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sorry, the strain has to become
resistant to one to become sensitive to
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So additionally, we recovered a number of
strains that were resistant, de novo
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, to the talicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so working here with the green bean
pathogen, pathovarphasia licula,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the soy pathogen,
pathovarquycinia, just essentially exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultures to the B728A talicin,
selected for resistant colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confirmed their resistance and sequenced
their genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we would expect, most of the genes
that we recovered, this is just a small
[SPEAKER_01]: subset of the mutants that I've sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all map back to genes, glycosyl
transferases in particular, and these are
[SPEAKER_01]: well known to be involved in LPS
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're closely related to those that
have been described in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question that I had coming out
of this, thinking about how these
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions get in between these microbes
in the environment, we expect that there
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a selection for resistance that
will be imposed within the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if a strain does become resistant
to a given bacteriocin, in this case to
[SPEAKER_01]: the talicin, does that affect its ability
to interact with its host plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for both of these strains, the answer
was yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're looking at just infiltration in
this case, the green bean pathogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: green bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black bar here is the wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gray bar here is Harp-L deletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is blocked in its ability to
express the type 3 secretion system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of these other strains here,
BRN, is bacteriocin resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all independent isolates that
have independent mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see that after 24 hours,
they really have a growth defect,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for this last one, 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has something of a growth defect that
seems to do better than the other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that this growth defect does persist
it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see again, at 28 and 72,
at least for some of the strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect that this is actually true for
more of these strains, that there was just
[SPEAKER_01]: not enough replicates here to get the
statistics to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is true for pathovar glycina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see again, at 24 hours,
these strains are doing just about as
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly as the Harp-L deletion mutant does,
although they do significantly better at
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 hours and 72 hours post-infiltration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think there is some
replication issue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen this multiple times with
this experiment, multiple independent
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always lag behind the wild type
strain, even at these later time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know some of the genetics underlying
the bacteriocin production, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: what the determinants for the sensitivity
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we want to ask, well,
does this actually matter in an ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, going back to some of the
literature from the mid-60s, so for
[SPEAKER_01]: example, a study here by Garrett and
colleagues, where they were looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudomonads that they were taking off of
different fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little busy, but I just want
you to focus on here when they looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteriocins they were producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of isolates coming from
pear didn't kill other isolates from pear,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they did kill isolates coming from
citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the converse was also true,
that the majority of strains isolated from
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus don't kill other citrus isolates,
but do kill pear isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had the opportunity to
collaborate with Carolee Bull when she was
[SPEAKER_01]: still at the USDA in the Salinas Valley to
ask some more questions based on
[SPEAKER_01]: collections of strains she had had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people may be familiar with the
Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially the Salad Bowl of America
during the spring and summer growing
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons before it shifts largely to
southern Arizona for the winter growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she had noticed in this valley,
there had been two different pathovars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathovar API that would cause leaf spot on
celery, and a different pathovar,
[SPEAKER_01]: chorion drichola, that would cause leaf
spot on cilantro.
[SPEAKER_01]: These had been known to occur within the
Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the late 90s, early 2000s,
there was this new disease that emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a leaf spot of parsley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all in the APAC family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting observation that she
had is that within a field or within a
[SPEAKER_01]: given plant, even though both of these
pathovars exist and are causing disease
[SPEAKER_01]: within the valley, she never found a mixed
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would either be caused by pathovar
API or pathovar chorion drichola,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she never found them co-infecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our question was, well,
is this potentially an infectious and
[SPEAKER_01]: mediated inhibition that's leading to this
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we screened a number of API
isolates and related strains and compared
[SPEAKER_01]: those to the chorion drichola isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I'm just lumping everything
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not showing every isolate
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want to draw your attention to
is that essentially all of the API
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates killed all of the chorion
drichola isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this doesn't guarantee that this is
why there's this trade-off going in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, that it's a strong indication that
likely this is why you're only getting one
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other infection, even though
they're both confident in infecting this
[SPEAKER_01]: host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so originally, I thought maybe there
was going to be a reciprocal antagonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that that's likely not
the case, that it's actually the pathovar
[SPEAKER_01]: API.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it encounters the host first,
then it's going to block chorion drichola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chorion drichola is only going to
infect in the absence of API.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, there's work that we're
planning to do where we'll get some
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant mutants to chorion drichola and
then see if now we can get a mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then conversely, go in and delete the
bacteriocins out of API and see if that
[SPEAKER_01]: also will allow for the same co-infection
to occur as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's ongoing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I would just like to
acknowledge my collaborators on this work,
[SPEAKER_01]: my postdoctoral advisor, Dave Altres,
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A collaborator, Tanya Renner, who really
helped out with the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: phylogenetics for understanding the
evolution of the talicin or the derivation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the talicin from independent
bacteriophages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Carole Abel, again, she has now
moved to Penn State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've had a number of students
that have worked with me and contributed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the work that I've shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, I've gotten support
through the SDA for this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the students have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy is not here, so someone has to ask
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the two Parsi pathogens, do you see
that there's more API-caused outbreaks
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's theoretically out-competing
the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I would really
need to talk to Carole about because she
[SPEAKER_01]: has that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's true, but that
would be an expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's inhibition in that way,
unless there was some other compensatory
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that API is not as good at remaining
in certain reservoirs or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there may be some trade-off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would expect that that's the only
thing going on, that API may become the
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe earlier in the talk,
you said that in order for one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cinnamon D isolates to be resistant to one
bacterium, so they must, there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's susceptibility to a different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could explain why
that might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there genes that are specifically
being traded in and out at the same locus
[SPEAKER_02]: that might cause that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, just to reiterate, you're asking
for the trade-off and the sensitivity
[SPEAKER_01]: between the two, what is the basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there that trade-off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the answer is I don't know right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LPS is well known to serve a protective
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea may be one, it's the
largest component of the outer membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so potentially by losing the LPS in
its full structure, there's still the
[SPEAKER_01]: lipid A is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the core oligosaccharide may
still be there as well, but it's lost all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the O antigen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thought is maybe there's some
stress in the outer membrane that's
[SPEAKER_01]: leading to upregulation of an alternative
cell surface receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cell surface receptors are sort of
similar but different hypothesis is that
[SPEAKER_01]: that receptor is always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other bacteriocin, one of the
function of the LPS, again, we think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it protecting against oxidative stress,
antimicrobial peptides, but it may also be
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting this alternative receptor from
this other bacteriocin being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: access it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a couple of different
questions, but other than just the loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: the, or the disruption of those LPS genes,
there shouldn't be anything else different
[SPEAKER_01]: about those strains, complimenting them
and showing that it goes back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think would be critical to showing that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's a really interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: When are these, when is this going to turn
on potentially within the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we would care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do know that after infiltrating a
cell into a susceptible host and coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back 24 hours, I can recover the specific
killing activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are getting induced once they're
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I anticipate that potentially certain
stressors on the leaf surface like UV
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure or desiccation stress or
starvation will also induce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all of mine, right, I use mitomycin
C, it's sort of the sledgehammer to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them to turn on all of their SOS systems
and produce all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about this is it
couldn't be constitutive because just like
[SPEAKER_01]: with the virus, it's too bulky to be
exported out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's only a subset of the cells
at any given time that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: express this because they essentially wise
to release these into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what our hypothesis is
based on all of the previous research
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at the dynamics of
induction within the plant environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is something I'm very keen on
pursuing, yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the producing strain sensitive to its
own catalysis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you saw there, it was all black
boxes on the diagonal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there would obviously be a high
degree of selective pressure to become
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant if you have been sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two things related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the small, like the 4651, that small
single protein bacteriocin, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: the producing strain also has a
characteristic immunity protein associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the talusins, it's probably just that
its LPS is not recognized by the talusin
[SPEAKER_01]: as it's produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been some work looking at
evolution in biofilms and Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: aeruginosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will get these sweeps where a
strain will change its LPS to suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: become sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can show it starts to kill
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it quickly has another
mutation that blocks that from occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that does crop up in nature,
but it's quickly stamped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let
[SPEAKER_03]: me make sure I understand this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with your initial screen, you're using
mitomycin C-induced donors to get extracts
[SPEAKER_03]: that are then tested with various lines
and then mutates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do you get different patterns of
interaction if you look at competition in
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves as opposed to this mitomycin
C-induced acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I definitely am
interested in looking at is starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: move back into the plant environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't looked at co-competing them
within a leaf environment to see how much
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you may still just get,
based on where you find them distributed,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be able to coexist as long as
they're in different patches that are
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over enough times within a given field
potentially of interacting enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might sweep from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
