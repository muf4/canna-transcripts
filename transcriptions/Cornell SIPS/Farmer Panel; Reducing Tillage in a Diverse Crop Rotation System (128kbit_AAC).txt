[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to shift over to our farmer
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Jay Goldmark and Dean James,
who will be talking about reducing tillage
[SPEAKER_01]: in a diverse crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really grateful to have Dean James
and Jay up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dean is coming from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay is coming from Central New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jay Goldmark from Stonehouse Grain in
Livingston, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay manages Stonehouse Grain, a 2,500-acre
organic grain farm outside of Hudson,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm grows a diverse rotation of
grains, legumes, hay, and cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: while finishing several hundred grass-fed
beef each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stonehouse Grain also runs an on-farm mill
that processes grains that they grow as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as grains from the wider community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make animal feed and also do some
food-grade grains as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really grateful again to have Jay
here to share with us what they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: down at Stonehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm also going to introduce Dean
James at the same time, the other panel
[SPEAKER_01]: member.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dean James from Don Cotner Farms in
Danville, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really wonderful to have a Pennsylvania
farmer come up to New York and share with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dean James manages the farm I
mentioned, a fourth-generation farm
[SPEAKER_01]: consisting of 1,700 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotner Farms started their organic journey
in spring of 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhat new to organic farming,
but a long and deep history of no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Dean James has been no-tilling on
the farm for over 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have, in terms of organic
production, they now have 200 acres from
[SPEAKER_01]: what I understand in certified organic
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grow corn, soybeans, rye,
oats, spring wheat, hay, and sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Dean will tell you a little bit
more about that when he speaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm is also affiliated with Voight
Station, a processor for organic soybeans
[SPEAKER_01]: and canola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really happy to have these guys
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we welcome them with a round
of applause?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Jay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's somewhat intimidating, so bear with
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so weird to see many of you in
person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I talk to a lot of you on the
phone more than I see you in person.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I manage Stonehouse Green, and we also
call it Stonehouse Farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We farm down in West Nile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little way outside Hudson,
just north of Poughkeepsie and south of
[SPEAKER_07]: Baldwin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about on the east side of the river.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I looked at the farm, we grow a lot of
the typical organic grains that are eaten
[SPEAKER_07]: by corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soybeans include great stuff like black
beans, basil beans, syringes, lettuce,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the medley of small grains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do some experimental stuff with
sunflowers and flax and oats.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cool thing is we run an on-farm animal
feed mill and a balanced poultry diet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call us for a lot of cool stuff that we
can grow with a diverse crop rotation,
[SPEAKER_07]: like soybeans, corn, peas, wheat,
kale, barley, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by having the market on our farm that
calls for a diverse set of grains,
[SPEAKER_07]: it makes us grow a diverse set of grains.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably really good for our soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been organic since, practicing
organic since 2013.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we celebrated being 10 years old,
so pretty new, and certified in 2017.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of our grains, like I said,
we mill on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run an arts way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grind our mixer and then make different
animal feed products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poultry layers probably our biggest
seller, followed by soy-free poultry layer
[SPEAKER_07]: and then oxy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a look at the overview of the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We color code everything to try and map
out the logistics so we're not running all
[SPEAKER_07]: over the county.
[SPEAKER_07]: The basic rotation is corn, soy,
or peas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Followed by small grains under sowing the
perennials.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then depending on the field and soil
type, and if we're really hungry or keep
[SPEAKER_07]: supply in the mill, the grain will go back
into corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if the soil's not ready, we'll kick it
into a longer-term-paid perennial pasture
[SPEAKER_07]: that then supports our grass-fed beef
farming operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the two main pressures, they feel like
a pressure when you're managing the farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: is you got to grow grain into the mill,
and a lot of different grain, so that's
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of a good pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other is you got to make a
lot of feed for the cows, and that's good
[SPEAKER_07]: for the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think by having cows and having the
feed mill, it makes it challenging,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it overall really makes it so you're
growing a diverse set of crops in a
[SPEAKER_07]: long-term rotation that ultimately
benefits the soil and the energy you have
[SPEAKER_07]: there to kind of grow anything you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's just a real basic look at the
rotation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can get more complicated than this when
we grow some of the specialty crops,
[SPEAKER_07]: but in general, just like a standard jazz
song, it starts out with an eight-bar
[SPEAKER_07]: chord you can improvise from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our four-year chord.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, corn, and then to peas,
and then to rye, you know, till soybeans,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then back into small grains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if everything looks good, you're back
into corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess the point is after you
under-sow in your red clover or your
[SPEAKER_07]: grasses into small grains, that's where
you can lengthen the crop rotation to
[SPEAKER_07]: really build soil health and make hay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you've got fens and water,
you can graze it first.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all know how to grow corn like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a lot of work, but it's got
pretty consistent high yielding results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, in that crop rotation,
you need soybeans, so you grow them after
[SPEAKER_07]: corn, and you can grow them like this and
cultivate them with pretty reliable
[SPEAKER_07]: results, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the moment you stuff out soybeans,
because you need peas to satisfy the
[SPEAKER_07]: soy-free customers that are buying your
poultry feed, you plant your cool season
[SPEAKER_07]: yellow-grain peas in year two of the corn,
and then you harvest them in mid-July.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can do some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can plant cover crops, like a raised
crazy summer mix from Ron there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still got plenty of time to put on
some biomass, and you can chop it or graze
[SPEAKER_07]: it or make a village to finish feed on
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then still plant your fall rye in for
that mid-September day, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sets you up for soybeans in year
three.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of the unique thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got your big grass crop corn,
and then you go into your cool season
[SPEAKER_07]: legume peas, and you do another warm
season legume soybeans.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps kind of break up that typical
rotation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, here's a great example
of grazing your warm seasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: They seem to gain really well on that
raised crazy mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's just a look at, I can't remember
which warm season this is, but you also
[SPEAKER_07]: can just do nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of hurrying up and planting your
fall rye, just let it winter kill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've had a lot of no-till in
spring wheat into their kill.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a lot of no-till warm season,
or we've no-till winter wheat into that as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we're trying to terminate warm
season, just to hurry up and plant another
[SPEAKER_07]: cover crop, sometimes doesn't always make
sense, but for no-till soybeans,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what the plant calls for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we go out there in early September and
hit it with a high-speed disc.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a mix from where we had the
10-way mix with sorghum, saline,
[SPEAKER_07]: and cowpeas, and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those warm seasons are so cool to
break up compaction in the heavier class
[SPEAKER_07]: ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's rocky, but you can hear a field.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize this, but that field is
where we drew no-till corn this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we, yeah, we high-speed disc the
warm seasons, and then with a no-till
[SPEAKER_07]: drill, places right through to get in our
rye.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like Aaron was saying, we let our
rooster crows take us up to the acre and
[SPEAKER_07]: really try to get it in by mid-September.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it all goes well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The following late May is when in pieces
typically hits us around.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can lay it down, and then we're out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a field we did no-till soybeans
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really heavy, clay field.
[SPEAKER_07]: The moment we try and kill it in the
spring, it just turns into a disaster.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was actually a great way to treat
a heavier soil field, not to kill it at
[SPEAKER_07]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes the joke is, well,
no-till yields less, but then on a field
[SPEAKER_07]: like this, it yields more than if we would
have killed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, what Matt and Kristen were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, talk about what motivated you to try
planting no-till.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the farm, when we're trying to run
around, say, 1,500 acres of cultivated
[SPEAKER_07]: crop ground, you just start to run out of
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it seems like a well-balanced
portfolio to have 70% of the farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: or some ratio of the farm, in cultivated
acres.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then to try and target some of your
soils that maybe you lease ground far away
[SPEAKER_07]: from the shop, or some ground that just is
hard to till, to keep that in no-till.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because by the time you finish row crop
cultivating corn and soybeans,
[SPEAKER_07]: the crew is pretty tired running late
nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you get up to, oh,
we still have like 200 acres of soybeans.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, oh, those are no-till beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty cool to be able to plant
no-till and then kind of walk away and go
[SPEAKER_07]: back and take pictures and come and
harvest them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of photos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we'll show photos of harvest time,
because you look at all the awesome seed
[SPEAKER_07]: catalogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And oftentimes, you see photos of like
late June, early July.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soybeans are really nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: The corn is nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, of course, they don't show all
the warm season weeds that come on in
[SPEAKER_07]: mid-July and August.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought I'd throw this clip in.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a no-till soybean field.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, hardly any broadleaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a lot of boxed days.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't feel pressure there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it goes right through the top of the
line after our crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine foot, of course, they do scatter some
weed seeds there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that overall, it seems like we're
finding a place in our location to
[SPEAKER_07]: experiment planting no-till with winter
weeds, spring weeds, into those warm
[SPEAKER_07]: season mixes, like I mentioned,
and just relay cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we get better at, you know,
with a warm season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of disking it, you can just run
right through it with cows and graze it
[SPEAKER_07]: and then no-till in your rye, you know,
trying things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, any opportunity we
have to frost seed clovers or mustards or
[SPEAKER_07]: if we're going to, after small grains,
go into a longer-term pasture,
[SPEAKER_07]: we just, there's ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: To frost seed your grass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the exciting things we did this
year were related to no-till corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Aaron's always said, don't try this
on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it with a rye lab on 30 acres,
which is the largest amount we've ever
[SPEAKER_07]: done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is that same field, I think,
two years prior.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in that warm season mix that we
were high-speed disking.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of, it's got some rock,
it's kind of cobbly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this year, last year, 2024,
it dried out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what was cool is that, I don't know if
you can tell by that picture on the right
[SPEAKER_07]: with the platter, we're just planting
right through standing, but we've never
[SPEAKER_07]: done that before.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rye lab really encouraged us to try it
out and it worked really split.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was June 10th.
[SPEAKER_07]: At a room full of farmers, June 10th is
the last stage you can ensure your corn
[SPEAKER_07]: crop at 100%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that worked out pretty cool,
but we could still ensure no-till corn at
[SPEAKER_07]: 100% of the five-year farm average.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are, June 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nine days later, we plant those corn
and just walk away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nothing's ever gonna grow there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the corn started to come up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was during that heat wave.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were in a drought.
[SPEAKER_07]: And another look at our cultivated corn on
the same day.
[SPEAKER_07]: The headlands are starting to wilt there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that little spider corn doesn't even
know it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed pretty protected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So five days later, we are rowing up
through the rolling crypt area vetch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, we rolled it by this point,
but we basically really didn't need to
[SPEAKER_07]: even roll in front of the vetch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just by planting into it, standing,
and the heat and drought conditions,
[SPEAKER_07]: the elbow disc openers on the planters
seemed to slice and kill the vetch.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we did roll it, probably around
there, or maybe just a little bit before
[SPEAKER_07]: there, flattened the corn, and the one to
two we staged with the corn came right
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, something I never would have tried
if the rye left.
[SPEAKER_07]: And said, yeah, we've done it right out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the corn kept, it just kept doing
great, even though it was a really weird
[SPEAKER_07]: dry year.
[SPEAKER_07]: August 5th, we started to tassel out.
[SPEAKER_07]: On that 30-acre block, we did five
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: The shortest day was 88.
[SPEAKER_07]: The longest day was 102.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of the five varieties, yeah,
here's the 97-day corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you kind of have to see it to believe
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought this would work out this
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam, who's around the combine here,
was just over the moon.
[SPEAKER_07]: An ideal monitor just said, like,
over 200.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that variety averaged 126,
which was an acre over a 90-acre block,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the 102-day did it, what did it
do?
[SPEAKER_07]: 132.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, sorry, the 95-day did the best at 132,
which was an acre.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was, it killed me in the last minute,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we did this on a large scale,
I want hydraulic down pressure on a
[SPEAKER_07]: planter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it gave us kind of a crazy amount of
confidence to keep experimenting with
[SPEAKER_07]: scaling this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seemed to work really well,
even on a dry year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it depends on your soil type,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we did a control, we did till.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think five acres of that till.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we plowed down five acres of that
till.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a control in fact, in 95-day corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's dry now, and definitely was
attacked by lack of moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's just another few clips.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're no-till planting soybeans and
they're all dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are when I was working with Jeff
at the farmhug.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were no-building for standing dry
before planting dry beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was just an attempt to dry them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the soil was really wet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cold, so we were trying to get through
the rye before we rolled it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went a lot and all up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're loosening on the seed zones
and aerating the soil and warming it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a couple days later, we came back
in and rolled it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was kind of scary because I was
like, oh no, we can't find our seed lines
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: But around the same time, we were learning
about how to share EPS lines, which is
[SPEAKER_07]: really cool with organic farming,
but then you can turn these layers and
[SPEAKER_07]: layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we then came back and planted on this
in a pretty rich zone with the planter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have any pictures of the beans
here, but they turned out really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're still trying to grow beans as
good as we did back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's just a close look of the seed
trenching and no-till soybean.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the... Anyway, you'll see that
we use mycorrhizal inoculants in the seed
[SPEAKER_07]: box just to try and help with the
biophobes of the seed and help it partner
[SPEAKER_07]: with microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look on that picture on the
right, it's like a little cat mushroom
[SPEAKER_07]: there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of biology underneath
that patch of rye.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're learning about no-till
[SPEAKER_07]: is still a bit of a wild card,
but I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so hard to scale organic farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2% of all US farmland is organic
certified.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one of the reasons is it's
really, really difficult for a family farm
[SPEAKER_07]: and one farm operation to grow and scale
in size just because cultivation is a real
[SPEAKER_07]: bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can we do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think through these innovator no-till
techniques, when you put a 12-row or a
[SPEAKER_07]: nice big planter go out and plant a lot of
corn in the standing bench, that could be
[SPEAKER_07]: a big pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we still really don't know what to do
after.
[SPEAKER_07]: We plant no-till corn because there is the
batch that comes back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we typically just kick it into an air
rotation to manage the batch that makes
[SPEAKER_07]: great forage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're gonna keep experimenting
with different fall cover crops to set up
[SPEAKER_07]: for no-till corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Matching oats is kind of our standard
seed, 30 pounds of batch, 100 pounds of
[SPEAKER_07]: oats.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the mass and fixation mix well
with wheat is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been growing that as a pericarp or a
plowed arrow corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: My family started to let it go too long
and it started to punch up and create
[SPEAKER_07]: problems with the plow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one piece we said, don't even
plow it, let's just plant right into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that started to work pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then more than interested what happens
when you do less.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with a warm season crop we have
established after P. If we graze it with
[SPEAKER_07]: our cows and let it naturally winter kill,
maybe we actually have ones with a high
[SPEAKER_07]: disc and plant corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are some of the low impact ways
we're thinking about going forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like Aaron said, start small and scale
up if things are working well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have time for one question
maybe for Jay while we switch slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's anyone that has a burning
question, there will be time after Dean
[SPEAKER_01]: presents as well for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anybody wants to ask Jay about what
he was just talking about, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this would be a good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problems with slots?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we've never done anything about it,
but we go out and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially our neighbors will call up and
say, hey, we just started to replant a
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can check and scatter in your fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's maybe why some of the fields
are a little less with no-till soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to shift over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, really inspiring and great to see
some of the results from the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay's placed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dean's going to take over now and tell
us about what he's been up to.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of familiar faces here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really good between Matt and
Aaron.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're pretty good educators.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been no-till on the farm,
like Matt said, for 50-some years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the work came down from up above,
we should try this organic thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really hung our heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we went out and did like a lot of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent a lot of time on YouTube and
podcasts and everything and decided that
[SPEAKER_06]: we'd try this through transition,
especially, and see how we made out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a picture of some rolled down
line.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we do a lot of our
conventional farming and how we knew that
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff could work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've even tried things on the
conventional side.
[SPEAKER_06]: In case it got out of hand, we'd be
controlled just to evolve it into the
[SPEAKER_06]: organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our corn experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: First year, we went into it with a lot of
high hopes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had our legumes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was crimps of clover and vetch and,
of course, the rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: We waited until the rye was going to be in
the thesis of planting corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way we do it, we see Rodeale.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of guys talking about roller
crimping.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how you guys did it,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, crimp the rye and then plant it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our thing has always been plant and then
crimp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was good to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got Aaron to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing we often thought was
because we could crimp later, we could
[SPEAKER_06]: actually kind of go a little bit against
the grain on an angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things would cover the row,
keep the weeds out of the row.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was our mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it was a learning curve because
the rye was ready to be rolled,
[SPEAKER_06]: the crimping clover and the vetch was not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went both ways on this field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went out to get the rye down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the crimson just grew back up and we
had to come back later on and roll that
[SPEAKER_06]: also.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's actually some seven and a
half inch beans that we've done too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first year there again on the bean
side was we were at O'Grain's and we went
[SPEAKER_06]: out to supper and there was a guy from
Wisconsin or Michigan and he was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about non-vermalated rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: He spoke up pretty highly that summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we tried that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried the row model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proof of concept, pushing the lawn mower
up and down the rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: But because we wanted to stay the no-till,
the covered soils, they say it takes,
[SPEAKER_06]: what, 200 years to develop an inch of
soil, top soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty critical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's say if there hadn't been no-till
for as long as we are, that's been the big
[SPEAKER_06]: thing is the erosion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a picture after the farm is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the tension closing in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought we were off to a pretty good
start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Couple of broad leaves there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down here in the forest, you can kind of
see some vets that wasn't taken out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a little bit was not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then as the season went on,
this is what we were seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stand wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We found that the different folks had
talked about it and they were thinking it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a planting depth issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I need to quantify that with our
planter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a planter with hydraulic
downforce.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was not an issue there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly recommend going to plant through
thick covers is to have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're not planting the end rows
first, because you won't get a stand on
[SPEAKER_06]: the end rows where they rise later.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a bargain to get through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had airbags on the last planter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not able to plant through until
we've got the hydraulic downforce.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't run a road cleaner in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't run a colder in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a double disc opener.
[SPEAKER_06]: As things have progressed, we've realized
that we don't need a set of colders.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this too, this is some things that we
were seeing on even emergence.
[SPEAKER_06]: V5 and V3 are right there next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we knew the yield wasn't going to be
really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did get it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the yield was like 65 bushel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we thought we're not going to throw it
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured we got to try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, second year, it turned dry on us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Between the deer and dry weather,
we never ran a combine through the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been pretty discouraged.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's good to see Jay offer some
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a way to make it work.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was another experiment that we ran.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were transitioning this field.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a year prior to trying to grow
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided our planter was wide enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to try it through scenarios,
go through the roller cramp, go through
[SPEAKER_06]: some work ground, and then plan a dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing we found was that the only
place we had any stand was where it was
[SPEAKER_06]: bare ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of tossed that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if anyone else has done that
or not in suns.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'd be nice to be able to do it after
seeing the erosion here and talk about the
[SPEAKER_06]: hard rainfalls.
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're getting nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of a tough thing to see your
soil walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: The birds made out really well on the
sunflowers there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They cleaned them off for that year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of where we've evolved to
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still trying to grow beans and rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know that if we're going to do
that, we've got to have a place to stand
[SPEAKER_06]: and rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we've learned through Penn
State and our small grains is to get it
[SPEAKER_06]: tillered out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this ground had later than we were
to spread on as part of the rye heating
[SPEAKER_06]: planter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that picture was just
taken early last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see how it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it will do what we want to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's one thing to keep in mind is
you've got to make a judgment call on your
[SPEAKER_06]: stand when you do this with your plain
beans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you don't, you're going to have
a mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have rye coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the row, in the side row, you can't get
it cultivated out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've done that already.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've taken a field of rye out that didn't
look like it was going to do what it was
[SPEAKER_06]: supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another picture of that rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've evolved through a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to try planting some beans in a
good stand of winter peas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing that we did have to do after
the plan, this is roller crimps.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing on roller crimpers,
ours is a 30 foot roller crimper,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it has three sections.
[SPEAKER_06]: To do it again, we'd rather have more
sections for uneven ground so it follows
[SPEAKER_06]: the ground contour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds and legumes are not hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's the grass, it's the rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they do continue to suck moisture out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't kill it immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the field of beans a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see there's a few broadleaves
coming in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did go back through that with a high
residue cultivator.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those beans did 35 bush of a horse,
which was a little off the farm average.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the thoughts were that field
was really stony kind of ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're wondering if that's not what it
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're really trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we're going to
transition over to more of a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some, if you have questions for
the panelists, this is the time to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some questions that we are
thinking about as well, but want to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: it over to you first and just see,
based on what you were hearing,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of discussion about reducing tillage
and organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, trying to protect our soil health
that we've worked so hard to build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought, yeah, some very interesting
stories from Jay and from Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if anyone in the audience
has any questions, wants to kick things
[SPEAKER_01]: off for the panel discussion at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if either of you
considered or saw any side by side,
[SPEAKER_02]: see if there's any value.
[SPEAKER_06]: We typically, we put fish in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if we put fish in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also chilean to the side, just trying
to get going.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the corn, there are the pictures I
showed of the rolled out covers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew that there was going to be a lot
of nitrogen die-up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the one thing we'd stand up to
get past, is the rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that there is a lot of that
die-up in the commercial side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep talking about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we overcame the rye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks probably have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the right kind of die-up by
adding like 60 units of carbon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't able to do that on the organic
corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we kind of backed off trying to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't done any side by side trials by
the time we finish the cultivated ground
[SPEAKER_07]: to get to the no-till ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to leave the planter just the same
way it's set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put down liquid micronutrients,
and organic jam, and a van biolen coat
[SPEAKER_07]: seed inoculum.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting because it doesn't really
go down in with the seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right on top of the mulch that's
going up through the seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the liquid's getting close to
the seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're hoping for with
their biology around the seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sunflower comment brought up a
question that came up when I was in Purdue
[SPEAKER_04]: conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had people saying that sunflowers do
great at no-till into rye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had other people saying we plant
rye after sunflowers because we know it'll
kill us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there won't be any volunteers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What came out of it was that there were
some varieties of sunflowers that worked
[SPEAKER_04]: with certain varieties of rye that did
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other varieties of sunflowers that had
been killed by the rye.
And it would be an interesting thing to
assign to Matt or somebody in your
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only figure out which varieties
work with which varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wondered if that fits any of your
observations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was just that one time we did
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could very well be what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like maybe we ought to try a little
something again, if nothing other than
[SPEAKER_06]: just not an experimental base.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there is a lot of erosion in the
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have a pause and ask
questions because everybody's thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I find answers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the whole word to
answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the answer may be fleeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can have ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look into things as to why
things are, you may find something to pop
[SPEAKER_06]: up that you need to know that you can't
deny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to throw another observation out
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that discussion for you, there was a
researcher who had been noticing with
[SPEAKER_04]: wheat in the Carolinas where they double
cropped and planted soybeans after wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was suddenly noticing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That certain varieties of soybeans would
yield 10 to 20 bushel better after certain
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties of wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He found an interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started looking at if you're going
to be double cropping after wheat,
[SPEAKER_04]: which variety of wheat would work with
which variety of soybeans afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of those things that never
got followed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it would be really useful in
no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may take out one variable that's
causing problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I immediately think of animals,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because you have Angus cattle doesn't
mean they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: In every plant, there's a different
character and personality.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good reminder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say that about half of our
research agenda in the Sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: Cropping Systems Lab is coming from
Claussen and his suggestions about things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the Martins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all their contributions now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really interesting ideas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other comments, questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily in the back there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the neighbor knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, when I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, catching up before this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like, yeah, you travel far
enough away from the farm that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: considered an expert now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, back on the farm, we're just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what we do is so different.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do feel like I was connected with
some of our neighbors who no-till.
[SPEAKER_07]: With using elephants, but they were really
excited to see what we were doing with the
[SPEAKER_07]: no-till corn into standing their vetch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that they can do,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I felt like we were we were bonding
over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A question, are you doing any type of food
grade, small grains or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is the vetch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you had any issues with vetch in
those volunteers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you have to ask?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, we do grow a pair of grain
wheat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can't do that where we are
experimenting with from no-till corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down our way, they say if you grow vetch,
it gets attached to the beef.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys experimenting no-tilling your
beans with something more than a 30-inch
[SPEAKER_05]: tall plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe double 15 or 17.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, the first year I referred to
that, non-burn rate of rye, 30-inch beans,
[SPEAKER_06]: and also drill beans.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drill beans, 30-inch, 30-feet is out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, the biggest thing that we've
learned about organic is you got to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: plan A, B, C, and sometimes a plan D,
and the 30-inch rows that allow us to have
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's kind of why we're staying on
30-inch rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some folks near us,
and they're pushing like, 250,000
[SPEAKER_06]: population out on no-till, like
conventional.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the one thing that we found,
too, I mean, in the no-till, we have
[SPEAKER_06]: maresdale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the no-till, the cover crops,
then we grow that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that may be something that the future
is very long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience is the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: We found it on 30-inch and with a 7-inch
grain drill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've gotten into, as well,
just tilling, doing the same kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: seedbed, perhaps, with tillage,
and then planting in late, like in
[SPEAKER_07]: mid-June, after the first summer flush of
weeds come, and then just rotary growing
[SPEAKER_07]: the soybeans on 70 feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a question for you, Jake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever died weeding beans,
and how many times have you been over
[SPEAKER_06]: control weeds in this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We die when we eat a lot of beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Mike, wake up.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just put that thing down and project
it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we die a lot, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically comes down to soil type.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we've got really heavier soil,
we'll go rotary out and crack open the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the time meter's great on lighter
soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on the scale of the operator,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can really help, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the time meter's really delicate with
the settings.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll rotary out a lot, especially in
the feeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go out and constantly do
the four times and telling it to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we're going to wrap it up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jay and me will be here all day,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please feel free to follow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
