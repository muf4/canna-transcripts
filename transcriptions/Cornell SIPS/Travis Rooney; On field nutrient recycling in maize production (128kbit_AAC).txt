[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start off with a familiar slide
for everybody and that's the world
[SPEAKER_02]: population growth from 1700 to 2100.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's projections and it's growth rate and
the main this this population has and will
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to play stress on agriculture and
the main point of this slide is that to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed this population increase we're going
to need to make agriculture more
[SPEAKER_02]: productive but also more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a major aspect of sustainability we
need to keep in mind that humans already
[SPEAKER_02]: control the majority of nitrogen and
phosphorus flows in the world and so any
[SPEAKER_02]: solution to sustainability which is going
to feed right back into productivity those
[SPEAKER_02]: two goals are not exclusive are going to
have to any solution to sustainability is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to focus and to address
nutrient management and reuse and so how
[SPEAKER_02]: then can we use genetics to work towards
this and really going into us we think we
[SPEAKER_02]: can use genetics to change nutrient flow
and so we can move from focusing
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically back on the maze we can use
genetics to change nutrient flow and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: can go from this conventional system where
we're taking our nitrogen and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: we're fixing it from the air or mining it
from the lithosphere we're throwing it
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the onto our agricultural fields it's
absorbed by the plant some of it's lost
[SPEAKER_02]: it's used for photosynthesize
photosynthesis and then at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: season it's most of this nitrogen and
phosphorus is loaded into the kernels we
[SPEAKER_02]: come through with our combines we harvest
it and then the nitrogen the form of
[SPEAKER_02]: protein and the phosphorus and the starch
and the grain are all forwarded onto an
[SPEAKER_02]: end use if we can if we look at this can
we we can use genetics to change this
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient flow and fundamentally change
what we're pulling off the field and as
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that we need to view we need to
view our agricultural production fields in
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of cases especially for industrial
ag as a place to farm carbon and those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients as something that we need to
return to the soil each year and not
[SPEAKER_02]: really the goal of production and so can
we then envision a system that looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: this where at the end of the season
instead of the nitrogen and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: being loaded into the kernels we're
harvesting the starch alone the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus is trapped within the column we
then take that nitrogen phosphorus we
[SPEAKER_02]: store it or process it we reapply it and
then it becomes the primary fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: source for the next year's crop now no
system is going to be 100 efficient and so
[SPEAKER_02]: there would need to be um for sure there
would be supplemental fertilizer that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in each year but if we could recycle
40 or 50 percent of the nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus that uh that are needed to keep
the maize field productive that would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge decrease in the amount that we need
to fix from the atmosphere or mine from
[SPEAKER_02]: the lithosphere and hopefully make maize
production more sustainable when a
[SPEAKER_02]: contributor a a helper towards mitigating
climate change instead of something that
[SPEAKER_02]: contributes to it and so when we're
reimagining this and using genetics to
[SPEAKER_02]: change this nutrient flow there's two
aspects that need to be addressed the
[SPEAKER_02]: first would be the end uses can we get
away with leaving the nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus out of the maize end uses and
then the second would be can we use
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics to actually do this is the
physiology and genetics can we can we make
[SPEAKER_02]: this happen and store nutrients within the
cob during kernel loading and so i want to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the end uses first and if we
look at maize end uses if we take the 2019
[SPEAKER_02]: maize harvest which is about 340 million
metric tons of maize 40 percent of that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes into ethanol production and 40 goes
directly to animal feed out of ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: production the starch is used is converted
to sugar and then into ethanol any
[SPEAKER_02]: component that's not starch comes out and
this is is called stillers grains or
[SPEAKER_02]: solubles and those distillers grains are
mostly used for animal feed and so we end
[SPEAKER_02]: up with 80 percent of the phosphorus and
80 percent of the protein in maize grain
[SPEAKER_02]: being used in animal feed so that ends up
being about a million metric tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus about 30 million metric tons of
protein and so we need to address whether
[SPEAKER_02]: in lifestyle feed we can eliminate these
two components i would argue that for
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus we can already for sure we can
we can decrease or even eliminate it in
[SPEAKER_02]: maize kernel with minimal effect on on in
animal feeds and the reason that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: two reasons for that one is that maize
primarily stores phosphorus as phytic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not digestible in monorumid
animals this can be somewhat mitigated by
[SPEAKER_02]: the addition of phytase either by
modifying modifying genetically modifying
[SPEAKER_02]: these animals to endogenously endogenously
produce phytase or by adding it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: feed ration but that doesn't address the
second issue which is purely the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus that these animals are being
fed it's too much for them to use
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively and absorb effectively and so
we end up with a large pool of excreted
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus and there's difficulty
concentrating that enough to make movement
[SPEAKER_02]: of it to uh to um it's difficult to
concentrate that excreted phosphorus into
[SPEAKER_02]: a form that's economically viable to move
the distances that's needed um maize
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen so maize protein is is more
unclear the end use of this definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be investigated more so the
digestibility and end use is higher than
[SPEAKER_02]: in phosphorus and protein is also used as
metabolizable energy by these animals but
[SPEAKER_02]: that has to be balanced with the fact that
half of the maize nitrogen is being
[SPEAKER_02]: funneled through ethanol production and
the drying of distillers grains represents
[SPEAKER_02]: a large energy sink in an ethanol plant
and so this onto the next point here
[SPEAKER_02]: projections on the future of animal
production so y'all have probably all
[SPEAKER_02]: heard ed's talk about where we're going to
get protein in the future and if that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens that's going to serve to decrease
the value of maize protein freeing up
[SPEAKER_02]: freeing up nitrogen for recycling on field
so one of the things that i would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: do this year and i will be doing this year
is some engineering modeling and economic
[SPEAKER_02]: modeling to help us answer this question
of where of whether nitrogen and when
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen will become available for reuse
so moving on to physiology physiology and
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics real quick i just want to
point out that maize is really well
[SPEAKER_02]: positioned to allow for two products
streams kernels and cobs they're
[SPEAKER_02]: manageable size and mass and i also want
to point out that the maize cob is mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: vascular and structural tissue and merge
of nutrients in vascular and structural
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues is not new and so the physiology
of storing nitrogen and phosphorus within
[SPEAKER_02]: the maize cob is not something that's
incredibly outlandish this is these are
[SPEAKER_02]: bark storage proteins and populace and so
in the winter we can see that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of protein storage vacuums and then in
the summer those all disappear because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been removed all that protein has
been remobilized for leaves for further
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesis and then focusing even with an
even with an even even closer closer image
[SPEAKER_02]: of these protein storage vacuums we see
that phosphorus is stored in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar manner in these perennial species
as it is in the maize cob so this begs the
[SPEAKER_02]: question of are protein storage and
phosphorus storage really evolutionarily
[SPEAKER_02]: conserved and is it just the location of
the deposition so in annuals it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: done nitrogen and phosphorus would be
deposited in seeds whereas in perennials
[SPEAKER_02]: it's stored in perenniating tissues so
that it can be used year after year and so
[SPEAKER_02]: that begs the question is it
evolutionarily conserved and can we use
[SPEAKER_02]: that to develop a maize plant that stores
nutrients in the cob at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: season and so with that in mind the
question then becomes can we turn these
[SPEAKER_02]: cobs into nutrient sieves such that at the
end of the season that's intercepting and
[SPEAKER_02]: storing nitrogen phosphorus in the cob and
preventing its loading into the kernels
[SPEAKER_02]: and so as a concept it seems like this
idea would work so further further
[SPEAKER_02]: research and experiments would need to be
performed on this so that's what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping to look into in the coming year and
so this also begs the question does maize
[SPEAKER_02]: store any nutrients in the cob currently
at the end of the season the short answer
[SPEAKER_02]: to that is is no maize does not have any
natural variation for cob nitrogen at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the season and we would expect the
same to be true for phosphorus and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: simply because it's an annual plant
there's no benefit to it for maize to
[SPEAKER_02]: store any nutrients because it won't be
able to access those easily in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: year it benefits it to chunk all the
nutrients that it can into the kernel and
[SPEAKER_02]: so the accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus
in the cob is going to represent a
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge to genetic modification and it's
going to require a lot of research to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement so appropriate modifications
must be identified and perennials can
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps serve as a source of inspiration
in genetics and so as we've seen with the
[SPEAKER_02]: popular species there is lots of there is
storage of nutrients in vascular system
[SPEAKER_02]: that we perhaps can leverage for the
development of a system like this and so
[SPEAKER_02]: but perennials but more closely related
species may be better better sources and
[SPEAKER_02]: so one of the things that we're hoping to
do is we have trypsium available in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell fields we're going to see what
nitrogen storage proteins does trypsium
[SPEAKER_02]: use within its rhizomes to store nitrogen
in successive years and so we'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: proteomic analysis in the in the summer in
the winter and look for changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: relative abundance maybe we'll segment
segment it out and see if we can't find
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's storing where it's storing its
nitrogen and as part of that we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: these the sequences of these proteins to
perhaps identify homologs and maize that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be co-opted or use those actual
proteins as sources for modification so
[SPEAKER_02]: with that coming up on time i want to
acknowledge dsda and the buckler lab and i
[SPEAKER_02]: would love to have your question here
awesome thank you for that great talk
[SPEAKER_01]: travis um if anybody has a question or two
we have maybe a minute so from mike door
[SPEAKER_02]: turning the cobs into a nutrient sieve
work through alternating alternate
[SPEAKER_02]: altering tissue specific regulation of
native maize genes or would it require a
[SPEAKER_02]: transgenic gene insertion approach so i i
do not know i would imagine that something
[SPEAKER_02]: that i would imagine that it might be
possible by alternating tissue specific
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation of native maize genes but it
might be easier to do using a transgenic
[SPEAKER_02]: approach but i do not know um one of the
experiments that we would love to do if we
[SPEAKER_02]: if we can partner with some with uh with
any of these plant breeding companies
[SPEAKER_02]: would be to express okay two in the cob
and see what happens so from kevin how
[SPEAKER_02]: many sessions of trips to come do you
intend to look at and assess natural
[SPEAKER_02]: variation for in storage and organisms we
have we're looking at it in about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: sessions and that's a pretty wide range
we've got floridonum and the dactyloides
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of their crosses as well any any
more any more questions feedback and if we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have time to ask a question or to
formulate formulate a question please send
[SPEAKER_02]: me an email i'd love to have feedback push
back on this idea um so travis just real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick assuming you you have all this p and
n in the cob do you just leave the cobs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field or you have to harvest them and
take them somewhere or what do you do that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a that would be another aspect
that would need to be need to be examined
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's when you grow soybeans or when
one grows soybeans the next year there's
[SPEAKER_02]: typically a yield on the maze and the
thought behind that is that the the
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen and the root nodules from the
previous soybean crop contributes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: available nitrogen for the maze plant and
increases the soil for that crop and so
[SPEAKER_02]: well root nodules are pretty dignifying
tissue just like a maze cob there's
[SPEAKER_02]: differences for sure but it might be that
if we deposit the nutrients within the cob
[SPEAKER_02]: the cob is a dignified tissue that would
degrade slowly and provide sort of a slow
[SPEAKER_02]: release fertilizer for the maze crop but
that would require more research and
[SPEAKER_02]: simply testing that out and it may be the
case that the cobs need to be harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: and stored stored over winter and then
chemically processed in some manner to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that uh make the nmp available
hopefully that answers your question there
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome thank you again for that that
great talk travis and the great discussion
