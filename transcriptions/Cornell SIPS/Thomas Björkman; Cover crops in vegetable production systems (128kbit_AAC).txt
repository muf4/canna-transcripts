[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the afternoon session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got three talks on vegetables coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope you all had a good lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to eat everything there,
but I saw other people eating good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will start off talking myself about a
couple of the things in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable cover crop systems that have
been of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get the most benefit out
of cover crops in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about vegetable
systems, what makes them distinct in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of cover crops, you have the high revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing good things can really be
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not getting a crop off is really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most vegetable systems, you're
returning very little organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on some work my colleague,
Jay Mount Pleasant, did based on a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable system that was used in
Western New York for about 400 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing no tillage at all,
maintaining continuous sustained
[SPEAKER_00]: production, you need somewhere in the
neighborhood of four or five tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter returned to the system just
to stay even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vegetable systems aren't even coming
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And intense tillage, the next thing on the
list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are real challenges to the system
where cover crops play a significant role.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to run very high fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the cover crops grow
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decompose faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to harvest the crops before
maturity, which means that the fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is running full speed and all
of a sudden it stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like most of the field crops
where you're letting the crop mature and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this sort of slowing down period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is tremendously diverse
timing of when things are planted,
[SPEAKER_00]: when things are harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means we need a similar
diversity in the kinds of cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities and tools that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for field crops, winter rye
gets you about 80% of the way there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with vegetable systems, it's maybe
20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a lot more possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do some nasty things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a harvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nasty, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the harvesters can be fairly tough on
them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some demands in terms of the
surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the surface of the soil it's
unacceptably lumpy because that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be picking up a lot of bean sized stones
that don't separate out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting nice transfer of soil borne
pathogens to the beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be held up higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some unusual requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is solved by rolling to crush all
the nice soil aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have a substantial amount of fall
traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corn harvester moves a lot of stuff,
but that's nothing compared to 50 tons an
[SPEAKER_00]: acre of cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I intend to ignore that warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't apply to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking off 50 tons per acre
of stuff in the fall when the ground is
[SPEAKER_00]: wet, you're creating some challenges that
can be avoided in some other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the questions is what should
one do looking at the Cornell soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: test, which reflects all of these
challenges that you have in the vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: systems to try to improve things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the context of how I've
been thinking about using the cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing the outreach in the cover crops
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've seen some things about the
soil health test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to belabor that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, but basically you get a report back
and there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you get bad scores that you
want to improve matters on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have data on how to improve some
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can get here management goals
done in terms of the challenges that are
[SPEAKER_00]: identified by the soil health tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are mostly done by the different
management goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So producing a decision tool that's
tailored to the vegetable growers that has
[SPEAKER_00]: that wide array of choices of cover crops
that will fit the different windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has a bunch of different times
when people might have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a cover crop, the durations,
because sometimes you have a month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have from kind of middle of
summer, not enough season left to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not going to be planting again
until spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have quite a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, I put that up big in case you
want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to remember and it works on your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere, anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is designed so that you can make
decisions fairly quickly based on
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints of a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that the different characteristics
of the cover crops are immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent, usually the ones for deciding
which cover crop might fit and how it fits
[SPEAKER_00]: in a myriad of combinations that can exist
in a vegetable system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a relatively small number of
answers, a relatively large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a perfect grid to match up
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of judgment calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, I think some of the ones that
are helpful are unavoidable problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things that you just,
you can't get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is an issue on your farm,
so here for the red clover retains root
[SPEAKER_00]: rot and legume rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a bean grower where root rot
is a huge problem, there's no way around
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't use clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cross it right off the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of things where we
can collect information and put it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: easily applicable tool and then avoid
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, picking on the red clover,
it's slow to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get a nasty weedy mess if you
just plant clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution is use a nurse crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a problem that can easily arise if
you don't know what you're doing or you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't tried it before, but there's a
solution to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, we have a lot of things that can
be added in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy place to take, this kind of
thing is an easy place to add new
[SPEAKER_00]: information as you do research and
discover new ways to avoid problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: More accurate numbers here, better
research support for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: management goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a nice tool to bring in the
work that many people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've been putting out the fact
sheets on the cover crops and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to contain only the information
that a vegetable grower in New York would
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are designed specifically to be
useless to the Vermont vegetable grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it's so specific that
if you're getting information that's
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized to apply to a broader area,
it turns out not to be useful for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that specificity is a real
challenge that we have in serving the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grower community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having no extraneous information so
we're not learning about Maryland or
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont, we're just applying to New York,
that's useful for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try to tailor something that
specifically, when I developed these
[SPEAKER_00]: actually seed sources was important
because people couldn't find the seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy or they'd be available for like 10
times as much as you would expect to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for the commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thankfully that's changed, it's
relatively easy to find reasonably priced
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop seeds these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was something that's also very
local because the transportation costs are
[SPEAKER_00]: high for a number of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna provide a couple of examples of
cover crops where we've done some research
[SPEAKER_00]: to optimize their use for a particular
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of this can be generalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to get some of the specific
timing different in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very short season crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's useful in vegetable
rotations is that it's five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a gap of five weeks between
harvesting one thing and having the right
[SPEAKER_00]: plant date for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with a lot of these odds and
ends of parts of a field that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available for very short times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buckwheat works very well for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's attractive for
vegetable growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used as a weed suppressor for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our summer climate is just right for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hot, not too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get some soil health benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably the weeds are the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to make a point of including
this slide in a lot of talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna have success for the cover
crop, this applies to pretty much any
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to start fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have no gaps in the stand and
it has to be killed on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most growers can figure out how to make
those three things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answers are different for every
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make those three things happen,
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with buckwheat, you have a fast
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four days, green line at four days,
is what one expects if one is to get weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the techniques that will get
you green line in four days, not five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the field preparation, timing of when
you plant, the kind of planting tools you
[SPEAKER_00]: use, planting depth, all the settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to get by three weeks,
you need to have at least 70% ground cover
[SPEAKER_00]: to suppress the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's growing quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to kill it on time,
five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns white when it's time to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively easy to tell the
difference between not ready and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of those three
principles in buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we figured out something about the
planting window that gives us this timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done with northeast serif
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that explicitly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at different planting days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did sequential plantings through the
entire growing season when we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the weather is different in
different days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so here is the early growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow fast enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the gray line at 70% ground
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the springtime, yeah, it comes out
of the ground, but it really grows too
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly to out-compete the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could look and see that it's there
and that it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, to get enough growth,
we need to be into July most of the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And August is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it tails off pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to see the far end of
the season, so you get enough biomass out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, we're not talking end of August
anymore, like in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's early August when that window
closes shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer we get is June and July is
when you can plant buckwheat and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful cover crop in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of work, you can develop
degree day models and get a map of when
[SPEAKER_00]: that last planting date is for different
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this can inform decision tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this number may not apply to the
entire area that we've mapped here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the software is so great at kicking
out information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we find is that it's really pretty
varied geographically throughout that part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the northeast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing I think in an earlier
session today pointed out how in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing the Midwest tool, you can kind
of figure out these lines run with the
[SPEAKER_00]: interstates and you've got these nice
broad bands of planting dates and you come
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the northeast and it's nothing like
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to use the same geographic
concepts in making recommendations about
[SPEAKER_00]: planting dates, you really have to change
how you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of mapping has been helpful
for thinking through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate tools that are available
are really helpful for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna talk about crucifers a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a little bit later in the
season than buckwheat, but earlier in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season than the winter grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ones that we've seen the most
of is the tillage radish by far,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a number of different ones and
you can use them in different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how the weather works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk about the planting
date issue specifically here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we did trials in a number of,
so this is Michigan, but you notice how
[SPEAKER_00]: abruptly the season ends with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it goes over a cliff at a
particular date, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not some subtle, slow, I think I can
get away with waiting another week kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when the season's over, the season's
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this with a number of different
crucifers that vary in their cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have things like the biodrills
radish, which is super cold sensitive all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to Athena, which is a winter
canola, which is fully winter hardy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is, do the ones that
are more cold hardy, can you plant them
[SPEAKER_00]: later?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you were to compare the red
radish here with the green winter canola,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much later can you go with the
canola than the radish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have the same date that that
planting window closes, which was not what
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected to find at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plus of this, of course, is that we
can use the same degree day model for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the crucifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that saves an awful lot of research
when we wanna develop the corresponding
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four crucifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's a little bit simpler
landscape in the fall than it was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: buckwheat one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a warmer season crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the four crucifers look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taken November 3rd of not this
year, but a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really function differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have tilni is a white mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's bolted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The straw is gonna stand through the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna hold snow on the ground
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a location where it's common to
have snow falls one day, melts a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days later, and it snows again a few days
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So holding the snow in place is a valuable
feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a caliente brown mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to just create a little mat
and not survive the winter at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canola is going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna look pretty much like that all
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna turn brown or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the radish will melt away entirely
fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great biomass producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that winter behavior is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an area where there's still
quite a bit to learn how to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: crucifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In just the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had quite a bit of experience
with the radish, but we don't expect the
[SPEAKER_00]: radish to survive at all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal with these is they should be
all dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be completely alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in between is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they vary in winter hardiness
from variety to variety, you have to match
[SPEAKER_00]: the variety to the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to adjust for the growth
stage too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have really tiny plants,
if you plant late and they just come up
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're counting on the growth to come
in the springtime, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna frost heave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with the freezing and thawing,
they'll push right out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're a little bit bigger,
so that they now make a rosette,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're at their maximum winter
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are gonna survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that you're growing
something like canola that makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: rosette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be that you have some runty
plants in the planting that only came up
[SPEAKER_00]: and made a rosette where everything else
bolted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well those little ones are going to be
surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bolted, so if you have a stem
or a bulb with like a radish or a turnip,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are going to freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other parts of the plant, the roots
and the leaves, they survive much better
[SPEAKER_00]: through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to carry over
nitrogen, for instance, those
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-containing parts are going to be
surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that match is gonna take some
tailoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a fair bit of education
opportunity, a fair bit of research
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to find what's going to work
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found with the crucifers,
there's about a two-week window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in August in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves around in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only about a two-week window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fairly short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course with vegetables, a lot of
crucifer vegetables not just the cabbage
[SPEAKER_00]: that Chris Mark showed off that has grown
quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the leafy crucifers are very popular
on vegetable farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broccoli, I predict, will be expanding
over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't have crucifer cover crops and
crucifer cash crops in the same rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're an important part of your
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winter-killed ones are great for
allowing early access in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have tremendous weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with essentially no cool
season weeds in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow them differently so that there
is residue in the spring, they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to carry over nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't solved how to get that to
work yet as far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually having the nitrogen still
there after the soil has been saturated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the springtime is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really needs to be green parts that
are going to decompose after the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: begins to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a trick to get all
that recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up massive amounts of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for crucifer crops, they support
soil-borne diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for other crops, they're actually very
good at suppressing soil-borne diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's probably an
overemphasis on the biofumigation concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more going on than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there's not that going on at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with some growers and extension
folks in California where their big cash
[SPEAKER_00]: crop is lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a bottom rot is the disease
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broccoli is a fantastic suppressor of
bottom rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cauliflower, useless, utterly useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think they'd be pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofumigant mustard, you think they'd be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Useless, completely useless for
suppressing that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grow lettuce and broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solves their problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we use the crucifers effectively
targeted for the specific diseases and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the varieties and types that will
actually do a very good job for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an experiment where we tried to
really identify the effects on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil health parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wet aggregate stability is the one I'm
going to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story was the same for all of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to show, in the vegetable,
high tillage, low organic matter return
[SPEAKER_00]: system, what would these different cover
crops do for the soil health parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that we couldn't detect
anything over a one-year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the same cover crop four years
in a row on these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had different vegetables each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vegetables rotated, but the cover
crop was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't necessarily want to do
that on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to do that to really try to
push the effect of that and pick up what
[SPEAKER_00]: the different ones did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had mid summer ones and then
later summer ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's ones that would be used in
mid summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So annual ryegrass, buckwheat,
Sudan grass, yellow mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the control is leaving it bare ground
during the non-cropping part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you want to compare is how
much did the wet aggregate stability
[SPEAKER_00]: improve after four years relative to the
bare ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is we didn't see it move
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then if you look at the winter
ones, the late summer planted ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: so annual ryegrass, rye and triticale,
you have live roots all winter long until
[SPEAKER_00]: the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might expect a larger effect from
those than from radish, turnip and mustard
[SPEAKER_00]: that die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you compare after four years
of these cover crops relative to the bare
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, we're going to have to make those
error bars a whole lot smaller if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to detect anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this high tillage system that
we're really beating up the wet aggregate
[SPEAKER_00]: stability with all the other operations we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, taking that system and
only adding the cover crop is not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to move the needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that we're
going to see in these intensely managed
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, that it takes a lot more
integration of different management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices if we're going to move the
needle on some of the soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intense tillage, very hard to
counteractive with just cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing tillage is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of the soil health test as being a
good way to identify constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to make those
constraints go away at all or just using
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them you just have to learn to
deal with that as an issue on that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular farm or field that that's going
to be a limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so avoiding having it get worse may be
the best that can be done for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the changing the management,
many of those measured parameters change
[SPEAKER_00]: quite slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where people are accustomed to doing a
soil test for the chemical nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: you add more and then you see next year
that those numbers have gone up,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works fine for chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: For soil health parameters, they're likely
to move more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not getting antsy worrying,
oh, I did this treatment and that
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and this year I did my soil
health test and it didn't change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I expected it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving the limitations continued
attention and cover crops is part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be part of a larger context of
how the vegetables are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on to the last slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, looking forward, what do you
think is the best intense tillage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any work?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know intuitively it's a good thing,
but I'm not sure it's been paying me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's returning me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious if you've done any work on
return on investment to buy a zone tiller
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, reducing the tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an area where we,
the community, not me, my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for cover crops that help you reduce
tillage, so the cover crop is doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that the tillage tools did
and think of the cover crops in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the zone tiller system,
you could combine that with where you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant something like the radish in the
planting row so that that will work up
[SPEAKER_00]: much more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a winter hardy cover crop in
between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strip tilling is an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our GPS guidance has enormous
potential to allow tillage only of the
[SPEAKER_00]: area you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of our crops, we need the good
seed bed needs to be about like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have porous soil elsewhere,
you don't need to actually till that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we need, but we're actually
doing this much for each row.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see some opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers who are doing that
continually year after year, finding
[SPEAKER_00]: easier access to the field for harvest and
planting, a whole bunch of other good soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health benefits derived from that that
really pay off.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a lot of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is about a one week or so window
when it seems to work, but it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: by that window will fall somewhere in
about a six week window, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know in advance which one it's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like that kind of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the publication isn't out yet,
but the answer is going to be this is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not going to work out very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done most of my work on this in
Geneva, some in Ithaca in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Geneva, there is a lot of cabbage
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had really intense flea beetle
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall, it hasn't been an issue at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the overwintering crucifers,
they flower in April and early May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the flea beetles are not out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with both of those, we've avoided the
flea beetle season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, come June, they'll defoliate
the entire plant.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the timing of the flea
beetle populations in those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a lot of locations,
the flea beetles will be pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: finished off by the time the radishes are
really growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Thanks.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
