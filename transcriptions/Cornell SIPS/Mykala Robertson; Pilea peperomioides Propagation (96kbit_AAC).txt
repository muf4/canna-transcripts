[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk Palaea peperomioides
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Palaea peperomioides plant or also the
UFO or Chinese money plant is a popular
[SPEAKER_00]: house plant with coin-shaped leaves and
I'm going to show you how to propagate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some materials we might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some gloves or clean hands, a sanitizing
agent and a blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nice potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like one with nice moisture holding
capacity for better rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plug trays or spare pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next I'm going to show you how we're going
to propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mother plant with a lot of
little offshoots or pups coming up around
[SPEAKER_00]: the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also have these little below the
ground root cuttings with new pups that
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't emerged yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to remove some of the soil
to make it easier to access some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings that we're going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice cutting from the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just come in with a clean blade and
clean hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take a cutting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some nodes for root establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should make a really nice cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some cuttings you can take
around the base of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we have some nodes it should
establish just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next after you've taken as many cuttings
as you want you can take them and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the potting media of your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this peat moss potting media with a
little perlite because it has nice
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture holding capacity for better root
establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some progress shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is three days after the initial
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some roots coming out from
where those nodes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about five days after the initial
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have six days nice root
establishment coming out of those nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally this is one week after our
initial cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be ready to grow and establish
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enjoy your new plants.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
