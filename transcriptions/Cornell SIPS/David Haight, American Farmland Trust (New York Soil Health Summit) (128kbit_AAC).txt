[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real pleasure to be here and I
really want to thank Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: for helping bring all of us together for
this really important conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have four points I want to make
in talking about healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the American Farmland Trust
perspective, healthy soil is a private
[SPEAKER_00]: asset with public benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy soil is vital to farm
productivity, the resilience of farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: severe weather, but there are tremendous
public benefits that we've heard from many
[SPEAKER_00]: of our speakers this morning that come
from healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally connected to our ability to
grow food, our ability to have clean
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and our ability to have a healthy
climate to exist in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's point number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point number two, I think when we talk
about healthy soil, we need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that holistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the American Farmland Trust
perspective, the foundation of that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation is to keep our most
productive, versatile, and resilient soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: don't pave it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cover it with concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not an inconsequential issue
for the state of New York that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: paved over the equivalent of 5,000 farms
since the early 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the foundation of a conversation about
healthy soil is to protect that land and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it in farming to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can complement that with
discussion that many of you have focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on today about the stewardship of that
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things coming together is
really the foundation of a holistic
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some valuable lessons that
we can learn from the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: on this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of California in 2015 began
allocating funding from their carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: market towards the development of a
strategic agricultural land conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have subsequently allocated 70
million dollars towards permanently
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting farmland as a way of reducing
transportation related emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In essence, if we keep people living in
cities more compactly, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce transportation emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've also invested their
carbon proceeds in healthy soils programs
[SPEAKER_00]: that invest in research and technical
assistance to farmers with the stewardship
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some really valuable
lessons that we can learn from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, the American Farmland Trust
released a research report called Greener
[SPEAKER_00]: Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a report that was largely based on
data that had been gathered by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Environmental Conservation
looked at greenhouse gas emissions from
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural land compared to developed
land in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the average acre of
farmland in New York emitted 66 times
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer greenhouse gas emissions than an
acre of developed land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if we could reduce the amount of
farmland that we pave over by 80 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2050, it could have the equivalent
effect of taking a million cars off the
[SPEAKER_00]: road in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wouldn't want to see a million cars
off the road in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that there's some valuable
lessons that we can, as a community and as
[SPEAKER_00]: a state, think about for agricultural land
as we're thinking about our state's
[SPEAKER_00]: climate strategy and that we absolutely
should have a really robust agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: lands component of our climate agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's point number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to go after Don and Dave and
John Paul, because I think one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons that I really took away from that
is how they are adapting and learning and
[SPEAKER_00]: applying some common practices,
but they have to be customized to their
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to be customized because of
the crops they're producing, the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: in which they're producing, also
management capacity is very much an
[SPEAKER_00]: integral part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been really excited over the last
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Farmland Trust has worked
with Cornell Cooperative Extension and
[SPEAKER_00]: Swale and Water Districts and others to
host more than a dozen on-farm
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations in Long Island and Western
New York, as well as five Swale Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Field Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our next Swale Health Field Day on
Long Island coming up, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: August 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that those types of on-farm,
in-field, really applied conversations are
[SPEAKER_00]: really critical to catalyzing this Swale
Health Movement in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to build on that, we are very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks ago, we announced a new
program with Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_00]: with NRCS, with the Department of
Agriculture and Markets and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: a program called the Practical Soil Health
Specialists of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a professional development program
that is going to occur over the next two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking to develop a network of
20 practical soil health specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people in the public sector or
the private sector that really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide training and technical assistance
to farmers in using soil health practices
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very field-based training
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applications for that program are due.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested, we've had a
tremendous result already, response
[SPEAKER_00]: already, but it is an exciting program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fliers in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, Jeff tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's got his hand raised in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about that
program, talk to Jeff or to Aaron Ristow
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last point I'm going to make is that
when we talk about soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to think about healthy soil,
not just on farmer-owned farmland,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on the land that farmers rent as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 20% of our land in New York is
rented land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often that can be the most challenging
land to get conservation practices adopted
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because landowners are increasingly
removed from the farm and may not know as
[SPEAKER_00]: much about production practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers may not feel like they have
the economic security to really invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: these practices that have a longer return
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are really excited to be working
with Cornell Cooperative Extension out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming County and other partners to pilot
some trainings, technical assistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and communications activities targeted
towards women landowners, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in the Genesee River watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing that for the last two
years, experimenting with some different
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next year, we're going to be
sharing our results and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really think that that is an important
part of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's often overlooked, because it's not
just the farmer-owned land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rental land is a really important
piece of this conversation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to close that this is a
really important conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a conversation, though,
just for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, this is a conversation for all
New Yorkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of us eaters, all of us that are
thinking about the water we want to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: or the water we want to swim in,
and the health of our climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a conversation that's relevant to
all New Yorkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
