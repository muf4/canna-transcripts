[SPEAKER_00]: ובאמת, יש לייר שמיון הוא יכול להגיע ל-3-4
סנטימטר.
[SPEAKER_00]: הוא הרבה יותר גדול, או הרבה יותר גדול,
הוא הרבה יותר גדול than what people
[SPEAKER_00]: usually think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only the skin, the visible skin
on the surface, it can reach much deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surface sealing has been the topic of
research studies for probably 70 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those early works are focused
on different aspects of surface sealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those works were mainly empirical,
you had runoff plots, you had lab
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last 20 years, there's been
increased attention and efforts to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: the mathematical models of seal hydraulic
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly led by Shmuel Asulin,
which was one of the instructors on this
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have the mathematical models,
you can then start to implement surface
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing into hydrological models,
either different scales, so it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: hill slope or a watershed, but you need to
have the mathematical model.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few words about surface sealing,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sea layer bulk density is a function
of the underlying soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have, if you see the cursor
here, this is the row of the crust,
[SPEAKER_00]: the row of the sea layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a function of the original soil,
the underlying soil below you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this delta depends on soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a less soil, it's 0.4 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it decays on exponential rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the X, you have the difference in
bulk density.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Y, you have the thickness or the
depth of the soil, of the sea layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this difference is maximized here on
the surface of the soil, of the sea layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 0.4, and then it slowly decays until
it converges with the underlying soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this graph here, the depth of two
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another prominent effect of the sea
layer is, of course, on the hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the sea layer connectivity stems
directly from the underlying soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the connectivity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will not go into all these
parameters, but what it basically does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it reduced, the hydraulic conductivity is
highly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to demonstrate this, this is a
Ruhama-less soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the bottom, you have the hydraulic
conductivity versus the head or the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom graph is for the soil,
and the upper one is for the sea layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the same, because this is the
soil, and this is the resulting sea layer
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just, as you can look at the
KSAT, or the maximum hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity for the soil, it's around
3.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centimeters per hour, and the respective
sea layer, hydraulic conductivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: is around 0.06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sea layer is about 1 or 2% of the
underlying soil, the conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge contrast in infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has, of course, a remarkable
effect on the hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sea layer is sometimes perceived as a
desertification, an agent, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: highly cited paper with over, I think it's
160 citations now, which place surface
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing as an agent, which accelerates
desertification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a few studies more
recently that show that the sea layer has
[SPEAKER_00]: also some positive effects on the ecology
of dry land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the work of Ivanov Atal,
which used a Randolph model, and he showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that surface sealing, if you account for
surface sealing, you have higher annual
[SPEAKER_00]: primary production on the lower
topography, on the wadis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another work which is actually a side
project of my PhD, we developed this
[SPEAKER_00]: Randolph model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a plot, this is a Randolph
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left you can see the topography,
so this is high and this is low,
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically the water is flowing down
from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right you see patches of
vegetation on this Randolph plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for the size, so you have the
perspective, this is four meters wide by,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was, yeah, 18 meters,
a length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the cumulative
infiltration looks after 51 millimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: a storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see, the blue patches here
are of course the vegetation, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend is the cumulative infiltration in
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see for example here,
it's a blue patch, has roughly around 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: zero patches, 3.28 of a meter,
which is about four or five times of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go even further down the Randolph
plot here, this is a patch which receives
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 meters of contributing area,
and cumulative infiltration can reach half
[SPEAKER_00]: a meter, so it's like 10 times more of
natural rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge amount for vegetation in
dry land, because water is the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor, and this basically places the
ceiling, it's what the literature called a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-local control on the soil water
content and the vegetation water
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water available for the vegetation
here results from water accumulating
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream, not in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also another aspect for
surface ceiling, which was rarely
[SPEAKER_00]: addressed in that the lower permeability,
the lower hydraulic connectivity also
[SPEAKER_00]: affects evaporation rates, not only
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see a work 40 years ago,
Bresler and Kamper, so they wetted two
[SPEAKER_00]: soil columns, one by rainfall and one by
flooding, and they measured the cumulative
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that for the rain
treatments, which resulted in rusting and
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing on the top, has lower evaporation
over time, and this effect was mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: disregarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that the sea layer also
has what they call a local control in situ
[SPEAKER_00]: by affecting the evaporation rates,
but this was not studied, so the research
[SPEAKER_00]: gaps for today's presentation,
what is the sea layer local control on
[SPEAKER_00]: soil water content, and what is the effect
on vegetation water availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in the literature, sometimes they
call it crusting, sometimes they call it
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crusting is more usually associated with
the biogenic crusting, but it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so these research questions were
addressed using two operational steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we developed a 1D bare soil Hislov
scale model, accounting explicitly for
[SPEAKER_00]: surface sealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a simple model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We neglect vegetation, and it's a 1D
model, so we don't have runoff and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have subsurface flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second step was to develop a 2D model,
which does account for, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: surface sealing and also vegetation water
optics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we include vegetation into the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study site, as I said before,
was next to Lavim, which shows a hill
[SPEAKER_00]: slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is semi-arid, close to 300
millimeters per year, and it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguished wet and dry season,
so all rain falls during the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and summer is hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soils on the study site are brown,
little soils and less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our model had a three by three meters
resolution, so it's basically a vector of
[SPEAKER_00]: a fishnet of cells over this hill slope,
and we characterized each cell with an
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive soil database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we collected, we had the soil
depth measured in 550 location at this
[SPEAKER_00]: hill slope, and basically taking a five
kilogram hammer and placing this metal
[SPEAKER_00]: wedge, and it's quite painful,
and done that 550 times with a crew of
[SPEAKER_00]: helpers, of course, not by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I interpolated it into a
continuous layer so I can assign the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: depth to the respective model cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had soil texture collected at 60
locations, at the hill slope, and analyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: for the texture, and that enabled us to do
continuous layers of the sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: the silt, and the clay content,
all in geostatistics in Kriging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a DEM, which was measured on the
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a total station to record the
height of the hill slope in 700,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that, 30 points all along the hill?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, after interpolation,
led to a 20 centimeters DEM, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively high resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have the DEM, you can
calculate the radiation for each cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: the inclination of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I further used a high resolution
classification to extract the percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rock outcrops in each model cell,
and I corrected the water availability for
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in the remaining soil in that
cell, some factor which we corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said before, vegetation is not
accounted, subsurface flow is not
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for, and runoff is not
accounted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this database was fed into
Hydros 1B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with
Hydros or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydros is a numeric subsurface flow
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had two cases, we had either a
sealed cell or an unsealed cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had a sealed case, we applied the
Muale Minasulin equation from the WRR 1989
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we developed the MATLAB code,
which basically automates this model
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout these entire cells,
and ending with possible to predict or
[SPEAKER_00]: model theta, the volumetric water content
in every location at the seal slope or any
[SPEAKER_00]: depth that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few words about the Hydros.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how those independent cells look
at the Hydros 1D software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the soil column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the sealed case, we had also a two
centimeter seal layer here, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized by the soil parameters of
the underlying soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each cell was related directly,
the sea layer to the soil in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydros solves numerically the Richers
equation, which I brought here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will not go over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses the water retention of both the
soil and the sea layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very widespread hydrological
software, Hydros.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I checked last month, there was 1,300
papers which have used Hydros since the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 90s, and all of them are available at
the company website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very versatile tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very strong tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every model needs to be validated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done it in 82 hill slope
locations before and after every rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: event of the 2010, 2011 rainfall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: 817 water content measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one is an average of three replicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I took to the lab to,
it's a gravimetric water content sampling,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the soil and weighed it and
placed it in the oven for two days and
[SPEAKER_00]: then weighed it again, and basically
crossed the 2,500 soil samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I took from this hill slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a bit of scattering, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the model to work any model,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it to work sometime or even
most of the time, but you can't really get
[SPEAKER_00]: it to work all of the time, any model that
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here on the y-axis, you have the
simulated soil water content versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see two ranges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these measurements here,
which has higher water content,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all sampled right after the
rainfall event, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So during that time, the soil moisture
variability is high, and the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was harder for him to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, if you look at the overall
accuracy and efficiency, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: national suit cliff efficiency of 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model works, but still a lot of
scattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the lower soil water
content measurements, you can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seal layer, of course, measurements
are in the blue, and the unfilled are the
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see that if you do not
account for sealing in your model,
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically underestimate soil moisture
measured at the field, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it quite clearly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to further explore this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an averaging of all those
measurements in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the y, the water content,
and on the x is the simulation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black circles are the measure data,
the average measure data of the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green is the sealed case,
and the brown is the unsealed water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, you can see that
during the drying intervals between the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall events, basically an unsealed
soil dries quickly and underestimates
[SPEAKER_00]: what's measured at the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that during the drying
interval, the seal layer reduces also the
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation from the soil and basically
keeps higher water content below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna demonstrate it through some
model outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, on the left, you have the sealed,
hill slope, the sealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, you have the unsealed one,
and the water content, the legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you have the warmer colors for
dry and the blue colors for wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here below, you can see just an
extract from a season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 2006 season in Leavim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just stopped the model right after a
rainfall event, and I'm gonna show what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening when you start the drying
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as days go by, basically the unsealed
soil dries much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a week or two, a completely
different water content map on the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to explore when is this
happening and why, and I'm gonna show
[SPEAKER_00]: three slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is what happens if you have
a seven-millimeter rainfall event on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hill slope, seven millimeters per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this intensity does not generate runoff
on our study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start the simulation from the
same initial water content, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the water content increases, but then it
drops and it remains higher for the sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, the sealed case here on the
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the next rainfall event
arrives, of course, the sea layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no runoff, there's no loss
of water, so the water content increases
[SPEAKER_00]: to higher water content for the sealed
case, and it remains higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had only low-intensity rainfall
event, you basically have always better
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions under sealed conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you have stronger
rainfall?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the top figure, you have a rainfall
of 15 millimeters per hour, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall generated 20% of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first days after the rainfall
event, you can see here the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, the red, the unsealed case has
higher water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have runoff lost in the sealed
case, water did not infiltrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a result, it has lower water
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a few days, five days,
for example, in this case, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed, and basically what the sealer
does, it compensates for all this water
[SPEAKER_00]: lost by reducing evaporation rates during
the drying intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the next rainfall event
arrives, again, the sealer or the seal
[SPEAKER_00]: system is favorable in terms of water
content and will remain favorable until
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens if you have a
higher-intensity rainfall event?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say 24 millimeters per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rainfall event leads to around 55%
of runoff, and for the given drying
[SPEAKER_00]: interval here for a week, the sealer,
there's so much water which is lost to
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff, so the seal system just remains
drier until the next rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot compensate for such a large loss
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a complex pattern,
because every rainfall throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, of course, has its own intensity
and drying interval until the next
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the long term, this is the average
of 32 years of simulation for that study
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the sea layer,
which is on blue, has higher water content
[SPEAKER_00]: than the unsealed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all individual cells,
8,000 cells just plotted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what also is important to notice that
on the y-axis, you have the temporal
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means how much does the soil must
change in time, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see that the sealer not
only has higher soil water content in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed case, it also has lower standard
deviation, temporal standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water content is higher, and it stays
there for longer of time compared to an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, can possibly have a
large effect on water availability for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation, which are surrounded by a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second part of this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that affect water
availability?
[SPEAKER_00]: To address this, we have used a unique
setting, climatic setting in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: where over a short distance, you have a
sharp climatic gradient over around 40
[SPEAKER_00]: miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 200 millimeters climatic
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can basically, we have here three
meteorological station, Lahav,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the setting which I showed
before, another middle one here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Be'er Sheva, and Sde Boker at the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use data from free climatic,
from free meteorological station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another unique setting is that all of
the south of Israel was exposed to aeolian
[SPEAKER_00]: deposition and the creation of less soil,
extensive less soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we can use the same soil
type on all of this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that will differ was the
climatic condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made it easier for the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the Hydros model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 2D Riches equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way in Hydros, or the way the
Riches equation implement the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: is by a sync term, this S here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is this sync term?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to define it using a water-optic
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hydros offers you a few to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common one is the Fedes
water-optic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go over it briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the S, the sync term, is a function of
alpha, which is a reduction coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain it in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is multiplied by potential
transpiration, which you assign for the
[SPEAKER_00]: simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that defines how much of that
potential transpiration is being taken,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, transpired by the shrub or removed
from the simulation cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the, briefly, what is the Fedes
water-optic model?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Y here, you have the reduction
coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ranges from 0 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the X, this is the water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is saturation here on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes dry as you go further to the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under saturated condition,
you have an anoxic condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have basically very little
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reduction coefficient is minimum on
high saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly, when the potential decreases
and you have a drier soil, this becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it remains optimal until a point,
which is defined as P2 point, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this model, it linearly declines until
it reaches to the point of P3,
[SPEAKER_00]: which stops transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to represent a wilting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the location of the
potential, the soil water content on which
[SPEAKER_00]: P2 occurs and P3 occurs are
vegetation-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to model corn, I have a good
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, or not everyone, a lot of people
have studied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just pick up from the
literature all the parameters that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want and go on and model it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to model natural
vegetation or sarcopotel or thorium
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosum, which is the main shrub at the
study site, it's just not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, you can't take corn and say
it's equivalent, because it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to calibrate and basically
measure those parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it using a lysometer
experiment, a small scale lysometer
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, where we had the shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew it in a greenhouse, screen
housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we planted it in a bucket where we
know all the dry weight of each component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we place it on high-resolution scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this scales away the weight of the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we know all the dry weight of
all the components, all the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: stems from soil moisture in this bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can track the dynamics of water
content within each bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to the study site and we
brought soil from the study site and we
[SPEAKER_00]: packed and we planted the buckets,
the shrubs in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you take soil out of the study
site, you interfere with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and you basically repack it in
the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know what now the soil
parameters are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil parameters will affect the
parameters which you calibrate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it in a two-step procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we calibrated only the soil
parameters which we packed in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that with a Hydros 1D version,
an inverse calibration procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used cumulative evaporation as the
objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically quite a good
calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now after we have that, we have the
soil parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take them back into the more
complicated case of vegetation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and calibrate the shrub water optic
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we did that using Hydros 1D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 15 different data sets of wetting
and drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we calibrated the five FEDIS reduction
coefficient parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a Latin hypercube sampling approach
which generate 20,000 parameter sets which
[SPEAKER_00]: were used for the calibration so we can
calibrate in a higher resolution way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top you have the calibration range.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom you have the resulting
optical parameter set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom you have the validation
of this calibration which was quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a note here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those P2 points, the P2 value and the P3
which define the onset of stress in those
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation and the wetting point,
these values here are the results of the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration assumptions that we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the drying interval between the
wetting events was the average drying
[SPEAKER_00]: interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was eight days between each wetting
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the average drying interval of
the study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we chose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this P3 value which is basically 1,500
centimeters does not reflect the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: stress of the shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not measure anything related to
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if there's actually onset of
stress in the shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that that's the optimal
solution for the average conditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: this vegetation study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, in the paper we show that 90% of
all available water is consumed within
[SPEAKER_00]: these eight days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the water of the shrub is from
the first eight days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in reality, in the field, it also can
extract water from cracks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying bedrock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has all kind of mechanism which
enable him to survive under dry condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the water is consumed in the
first few days, of course, after the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the objective function with the
water content over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: The community of ET.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community of evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we partition it between potential
evaporation and potential transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took these parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a hydrous 2D transect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue layer represent the seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orange is a root zone,
a uniform root zone, which is surrounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by a seal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the sealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, for the unsealed one,
just continuing soil, there's no seal
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two points, two observation
points, which I will talk about in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the boundary conditions for
the simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I developed this ratio, which I call
the vegetation-water-optic ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically the cumulative uptake
for the sealed case over the cumulative
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake for the unsealed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's higher than one, the seal layer
is beneficial for vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's lower than one, it's a negative
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used 35 years of climate data in
each of those stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some station I had 40, let's say Bukhel
site, but some less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, a few decades of climate
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the line represent the one,
the vegetation-water-optic value of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vast majority of all-season
surface sealing is a positive factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing vegetation-water-optic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average is an increase of 26%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite significant for,
of course, those vegetation or the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: land vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this effect is not
uniform across all stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black ones represent the weather,
the semi-arid site of Lav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which the seal layer doesn't have a less
effect, a reduced effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the station goes drier,
the seal layer effect increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the scattering increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can reach, for the Bukhel site,
vegetation-water-optic of close to 50% and
[SPEAKER_00]: 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge increase in uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain that using the observation
points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the root zone, we have point number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just outside the root zone,
we have point number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the water content ratio,
means the water content of the sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: system over the unsealed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's higher than one, water content is
higher for the sealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on the 1994 season at the Le
Havim site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that during the rainfall
event here, okay, so this is the water
[SPEAKER_00]: content ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black lines are the rainfall event
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during these rainfall events,
due to runoff initiation, so water content
[SPEAKER_00]: is lower at the sealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio is lower than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the drying interval proceeds,
the water content ratio is higher for the
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much higher for point number two,
which is outside of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's close to 20% higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what drives the water content
uptake of the shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a higher water availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting observation is that
the relation between the surface sealing
[SPEAKER_00]: and the annual rainfall amount is
non-unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this dotted rectangular shape,
which I draw here, you can see that for
[SPEAKER_00]: the same seasonal rainfall amount,
you can have multiple solutions of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation water uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening here and what's
happening that within season, rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics are highly important and
they actually drive the water content
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake and the vegetation water uptake
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna demonstrate it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have a low initial water
condition, this theta of 0.12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have two rainfall intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is six millimeters quite low and one
is 24 millimeters quite high per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you get is for this low water
content, initial water content condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have so much runoff generated that
basically the sea layer is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has vegetation water uptake ratio lower
than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stays lower than one, even if you
have a prolonged drying interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do the same exercise,
the same simulation, it's just started
[SPEAKER_00]: from a higher water content initial
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning of the simulation,
because of the runoff water content and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation water uptake is lower for the
sealed case, but after a few days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also depends on the initial water
content condition, on the rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity, and on the drying interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over an average season in a study
site, we have roughly 13 storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each one of those, the sealer can
either be a positive, a negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this accumulative effect leads to this
non-uniqueness that we've seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm close to finding out and analyzing
this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to also prove or show that these
results are applicable on different sea
[SPEAKER_00]: layer thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, the sea layer thickness is
dependent on the rainfall energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rainfall kinetic, the soil organic
matter, the soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the same hilltop, it can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually varies on the field,
the thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we repeated this analysis for different
soil, a sea layer thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically see that it's enough to
have half a centimeter of a sea layer to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a significant effect on vegetation
water uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, of course, if you have a
higher seal thickness, a larger seal
[SPEAKER_00]: thickness, that effect increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's applicable across
different sea layer thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface sealing is responsible for floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause property damage and might be a
negative factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has an essential role in the
delicate equidrology of dry climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This effect, it varies between storms,
between soil properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, under most conditions,
surface sealing is a positive local
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases the soil water content and
its persistence over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increased water availability leads to
higher vegetation water uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: which increases on the long run vegetation
resilience in those dry climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen the sea layer has both a
non-local control on vegetation and a
[SPEAKER_00]: local control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that places it as a key player in the
equidology of dry climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where water is the limiting factor.
