[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for inviting me and to
everyone for, you know, coming out on
[SPEAKER_03]: what's been obviously a very crazy and
stressful semester for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate when anyone does
anything extra right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm definitely impressed by the scope
of the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really appreciate you coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and share my slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for that
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Laura Ann Minkoff-Zern.
[SPEAKER_03]: I teach at Syracuse University in our food
studies program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also the graduate director there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just do a little plug on our
program because it's still relatively new.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we teach about food studies and food
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an undergraduate program as well
as a master's degree program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a mix of the critical social
sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then students also get to take
advantage of the Maxwell Policy School as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as some students doing some
coursework at ESF that want a bit more of
[SPEAKER_03]: the applied agriculture side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we think it's a pretty unique program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very lucky to have landed here in
Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get to teach about food and food
systems and sustainability all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really wonderful for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to talk a bit about the
research that I've been doing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: past.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the book now, by the time the book
actually gets published, and then all the
[SPEAKER_03]: writing period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really finished the research about
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the book came out at the end of last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Called The New American Farmer,
Immigration, Race, and the Struggle for
[SPEAKER_03]: Sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a photo of the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with MIT Press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always like to tell people that you
can get it open access.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download it for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the books that MIT made open
source last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So especially for grad students that can't
just buy every book they want to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really proud to have it available to
anyone that wants to read it if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to download it from the Press site.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, of course, if you find this talk
interesting enough that you want to hear
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this book and the talk today is the
study they did over the course of about
[SPEAKER_03]: eight years looking at Latino and Latina
immigrant farmers in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've chosen to, at least for this
publication, use the term Latino and
[SPEAKER_03]: Latina rather than Latinx simply because
that's how people identified themselves to
[SPEAKER_03]: me in interviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to honor how people were
identifying themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my study is qualitative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go a little bit into my methods and
how I did my research in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do always like to point that while
my study is qualitative, it's interview
[SPEAKER_03]: based.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't make a lot of quantitative
claims based on my own research.
[SPEAKER_03]: My research, it is backed up by
quantitative research done by the USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: census.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my study looked at Latino and Latina
immigrant farmers in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I specifically was doing research with
farm workers that identified as
[SPEAKER_03]: immigrants, as Latino, primarily from
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the census actually looks at a broader
scale of self-identified Latino or
[SPEAKER_03]: Hispanic farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I found in my study and what is
identified in the agricultural census is
[SPEAKER_03]: the same, which is that they are a growing
group of farmers in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while the census is broader in terms
of not everyone that's interviewed is
[SPEAKER_03]: first generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my study, I looked specifically at
first generation people that came and
[SPEAKER_03]: worked in farm work and then started their
own farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we also see from the broader numbers
is that Latino and Hispanic farmers are
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing and they are the largest,
most quickly growing self-identified
[SPEAKER_03]: ethnic group in agriculture today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's really significant and
it backs up everything that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about today in terms of why we should
care about this group of farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: what they bring to agriculture and the
tips of shifts that we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as the ways that they are
disadvantaged, the challenges that they
[SPEAKER_03]: face and what we can possibly do to better
incorporate them into agrarian systems in
[SPEAKER_03]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why this is really important,
if we're looking at broader shifts in U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, we know that half of all farm
operators are reaching retirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we really do have a gap in terms of
who wants to farm and who's willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: farm in the United States if we are
interested in maintaining local
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture and regional agriculture
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that most people born into
farming families in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: are not interested in taking on the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we, probably everyone here
already knows why it's really economically
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to survive in farming in the U
.S., in the global labor market,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the global market, as well as the
amount of labor input and how physically
[SPEAKER_03]: challenging and difficult it is as a
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, we see a higher demand
for organic farming and local food than we
[SPEAKER_03]: can even grow in the U.S., and you'll see
why that's significant, as well as a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher demand for regional and local food,
which arguably is growing during the
[SPEAKER_03]: pandemic, as we saw kind of people being,
the fear of supply chain shutting down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while that didn't happen, the demand
for things like CSAs and local food seems
[SPEAKER_03]: to be going up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, right, we don't have the farmers
coming in with the experience and interest
[SPEAKER_03]: in continuing the types of medium and
small-scale farms that I'll talk about,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So arguably, what we have is a population
of farm workers that have the experience
[SPEAKER_03]: and skill in farming, many of whom
actually want to own farms in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't have the capital and other types
of advantages to start those farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's kind of the gap that we're
seeing in some of the ways that immigrants
[SPEAKER_03]: could be filling the gap and in some ways
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to start with one of the
quotes, this is one of the quotes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of the book, by one of the
farmers that I met in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always ask the farmers, you know,
why are they doing this, a bit of their
[SPEAKER_03]: story, and I'll talk much more about,
you know, that they do this against so
[SPEAKER_03]: many odds, but to describe what their
motivation was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one farmer said to me,
and her farm is Mariposa Farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, which means butterfly in
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, we wanted to name it Mariposa
because you know the story of the
[SPEAKER_03]: monarchs, monarch butterflies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to fly from Mexico to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them die crossing the border to
reach Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the parents die during the trip,
but children know how to come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we as Latinos have a lot in common
with butterflies because in order to be
[SPEAKER_03]: here, we have to cross the borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly, a lot of times family lose
their loved ones, but their children here,
[SPEAKER_03]: the children who are born here,
always have the need of knowing their
[SPEAKER_03]: parents' roots and always go looking for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that represented a lot of the
narratives that I heard from different
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers is the ways that starting a farm
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: was not just a business, but a way to
establish roots, to revisit the traditions
[SPEAKER_03]: and culture that they had been raised in,
in Mexico, and also to teach their
[SPEAKER_03]: children about who they were and where
they were from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I met with the small farm program
at Cornell this morning and someone in the
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting said, you know, is their
motivation for them outside of economics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is their economic motivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that was largely what I found is
there was something more meaningful to
[SPEAKER_03]: them as to why they were continuing to
farm, you know, against so many odds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to scale out a bit, the larger book
project, I'm not going to answer all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these questions today because that's too
many questions to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I write about in the book is I
look at, right, why are they starting
[SPEAKER_03]: their farms despite challenges?
[SPEAKER_03]: I look a lot at the historic context
that's determined their position in the
[SPEAKER_03]: current agri-food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the relationship between slavery,
African-American farmers and immigrant
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I look specifically at how race,
ethnicity, and their citizenship affect
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural practices and their identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this transition from workers to
owners, as I say, my work really focuses
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically on farm workers starting
their own farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean for potentially labor
justice?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started out my research specifically
working with farm workers in my
[SPEAKER_03]: dissertation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really interested and I still am
very interested in farm worker and farm
[SPEAKER_03]: labor issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the lead into this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, what does this group
of farmers mean for alternative agri-food
[SPEAKER_03]: movements?
[SPEAKER_03]: What might it mean to the types of more
sustainable and socially just change
[SPEAKER_03]: changes that we'd like to see in
agriculture today?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to narrow it down today to
just three of those questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are they starting their own farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does their race, ethnicity,
and citizenship affect their practices and
[SPEAKER_03]: identity?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what's their role in these
growing food movements?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's a lot of literature
that influences me and the work that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, I bring together a lot of work
in agrarian political economy and
[SPEAKER_03]: political ecology with work on agrarian
cultural and racial identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the importance not only of structures
in agriculture in terms of class structure
[SPEAKER_03]: and class transition, but also the
importance of identity and culture to
[SPEAKER_03]: agrarian transition, as well as the ways
that food and agriculture and foodways are
[SPEAKER_03]: a form of resistance to the industrial
food system, to the ways that people are
[SPEAKER_03]: exploited and oppressed in the food
system, as well as the ways that people
[SPEAKER_03]: have historically lost their own food
traditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I draw on a lot of different
scholars that look at food as a form of
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a bit about where I did my
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of ways, this research really
followed me and my own path in life in a
[SPEAKER_03]: very practical way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started my research in the central
coast, the northern and central coast of
[SPEAKER_03]: California when I was doing dissertation
work in largely in Monterey, Salinas,
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Cruz counties in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came to the East Coast to do my
postdoc work in Baltimore, I started doing
[SPEAKER_03]: some work in the northern neck of
Virginia, about three hours south of
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I had established really two
field sites and started doing some
[SPEAKER_03]: presentations, what I found is different
people in conferences and different places
[SPEAKER_03]: would reach out to me and say,
you need to come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to look at this community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll host you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll introduce you to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are Latino farmers where I'm
working too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I really ended up in
Washington and Minnesota and the Hudson
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this is by no means
comprehensive of all the places across the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think immigrant farmers and Latino
farmers specifically are succeeding and
[SPEAKER_03]: have pockets.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many more places I could have
done the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at a certain point, I wanted to write
the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I found is really, I think in most
areas that have large farm worker,
[SPEAKER_03]: immigrant farm worker populations where
they have proximity to an urban area for
[SPEAKER_03]: direct sales, you will find immigrant
farming communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, this work really looks at
this agricultural transition or agrarian
[SPEAKER_03]: transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone that I interviewed that was
farming here in the US started out in some
[SPEAKER_03]: way farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vast majority were from Mexico,
all different parts of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a few I interviewed were from Central
America as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of them started off farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: In their life, in their home country,
they came here to work in the fields,
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly in industrial monocrop agriculture,
depending on whatever region they were in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them were migrant workers in the
US.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them had worked in Northern Mexico
before they came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But largely they were going from very
diversified, small scale agriculture to
[SPEAKER_03]: monocrop industrial scale agriculture in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were returning to some form
of small to medium scale farming and
[SPEAKER_03]: diversified farming again in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went from farmer to farm worker to
farmer again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them really identified as a
farmer throughout that entire path.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think a lot of farm workers in
the US identify as farmers, even when they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have their own land, even when they
don't have access to make those types of
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people would ask me when I
started this work is how can someone do
[SPEAKER_03]: farm work on someone's farm all day?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then have their own farm in the
evening because many of them had not made
[SPEAKER_03]: enough money to quit their day jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they do their own farming in the
evening and the weekends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I saw was that what they did in
their day job was very, very different
[SPEAKER_03]: than what they were doing after work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the Salinas Valley, they might be
picking strawberries all day long with a
[SPEAKER_03]: crew or planting garlic, something a very,
very repetitive task where they didn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: to make any decisions about how the crop
was planted, what they were planning,
[SPEAKER_03]: when it was picked, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were told what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after work, they would go to their own
cloud of land, which they would rent or
[SPEAKER_03]: own, mostly renting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be with their extended family.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be in charge of what was
planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were paying attention to the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the decision maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing tons of different jobs
every single day as you do on a small
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just an incredibly different
experience to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than working on someone else's farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was worth it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I'll talk about kind of why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, the story of, as I've been
saying, it's kind of this balance between
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges and opportunities that the
farmers are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, the biggest as first
generation immigrants in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: are race and citizenship based.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things such as language, the vast
majority, Spanish, was their first
[SPEAKER_03]: language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them had no to very little English
skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, in particular, and some in
Washington state, I interviewed a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: self-identified Mexican indigenous
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tricky and Mixteco were their first
languages, and then they learned Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: in Mexico, and then they were trying to
learn English here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most had not been, you know,
beyond middle school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some had not been beyond elementary
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only were they not reading and
writing in English, many of them could
[SPEAKER_03]: barely read and write in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a real lack of formal education,
which in the United States, farming is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually quite bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be part of a farmer's
market, you have to fill out forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to own land, you have to fill
out forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a business license,
if you want to be certified organic,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while, you know, a lot of people have
said to me, if you want to apply to loans
[SPEAKER_03]: or to work on with any type of extension,
a lot of people have said to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, no farmers like paperwork,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No one goes into farming to do paperwork,
which of course is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: To have to do that level of paperwork when
you can't read and write in English is a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole other barrier that keeps farmers out
of accessing particular resources and
[SPEAKER_03]: networks, as well as learning how to
market in the context of the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, which is very different from their
home communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just the whole concept of
marketing and creating a brand and these
[SPEAKER_03]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, some of them were
explicitly limited by citizenship status.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never asked about citizenship status,
but I could usually kind of figure it out
[SPEAKER_03]: along the lines of their immigration
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people, if they were
undocumented, of course had to,
[SPEAKER_03]: similar to Japanese farmers during the
internment period would turn over their
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses to U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: born children or neighbors or have someone
help them that had certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, many of them also would
experience overt discrimination,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I really did not hear much
discrimination, stories of discrimination
[SPEAKER_03]: by customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was largely by other farmers and market
managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So farmers, market managers, as well as
historical discrimination by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll go a little bit into that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I realized I actually didn't say in
the method slide, maybe I'll go back,
[SPEAKER_03]: just one second, is so my methods for
this, this was all long form interview
[SPEAKER_03]: based.
[SPEAKER_03]: I interviewed about 70 farmers or 70
farmers and 30 people in either extension
[SPEAKER_03]: USDA, regional USDA, federal USDA,
market managers, nonprofits, and farm
[SPEAKER_03]: incubators, basically anyone I can find
that worked with immigrant farmers and
[SPEAKER_03]: could tell me about their work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met a lot of farmers through people that
were working in incubators, farm
[SPEAKER_03]: incubators, or market managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then things would kind of,
you know, extend from there where I would
[SPEAKER_03]: get to know these extended networks,
family networks, community networks of
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all in all, it was about a hundred
interviews over the course of eight years
[SPEAKER_03]: and different kind of trips to each site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiple trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to kind of the obstacles or
limitations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always ask people if they had ever
reached out to extension, if they'd ever
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one farmer in California who
is actually a relatively successful
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had gone through the ALBA training
program, one of the larger farm incubator
[SPEAKER_03]: training programs in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had started her own certified organic
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually had a spot at many of the
farmers markets in the Bay area,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is very competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I asked, you know, do you look
for, for grants or loans or any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: help?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are, you know, there is help out
there for small scale farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: things like hoop houses, you know,
grants to help them with value added
[SPEAKER_03]: products, that type of thing that a lot of
small farmers in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: do access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said to me, well, if you go to an
agency and you're a Latino person and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a woman and you don't speak the
language and you don't have money and you
[SPEAKER_03]: go to an agency, the federal government,
and you want to find someone to speak your
[SPEAKER_03]: language, how do you say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to have a person to help
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to have a person that
speaks your language.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we spoke, she clearly meant this
not, you know, she meant this
[SPEAKER_03]: metaphorically as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, there was no one in the
office that spoke Spanish, even though the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of people in these rural areas in
California where farm workers live are
[SPEAKER_03]: Spanish speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one in her local USDA office spoke
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when she walked in, nobody really
wanted to communicate with her because
[SPEAKER_03]: they assume she's a worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had that really affirmed when I was
doing my research, every area that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to interview farmers, I would call
local offices of the USDA and any
[SPEAKER_03]: extension if it existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say, can I speak with anyone who
works with immigrant farmers in your
[SPEAKER_03]: region?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I heard multiple times, we don't work
with farm workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the Labor Department.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say, no, farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking to farmers and they'd
say, well, we don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many times they're just completely
unaware that immigrant farmers exist and
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't identify immigrants as farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not who they see as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is not always true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found in Washington state, there were a
few staff at the USDA that grew up in farm
[SPEAKER_03]: worker families themselves that
specifically did all the translation and
[SPEAKER_03]: outreach that made it their personal
mission to network to all the immigrant
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's only because of their own
personal background.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something they were being paid to
do or had been hired to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there wasn't an explicit effort,
it was not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, of course, this has also been seen
historically, structurally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are usually more familiar with
the Pickford case, the discrimination case
[SPEAKER_03]: of African-American farmers in the USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also a Hispanic and women
farmers women and Hispanic farmers were
[SPEAKER_03]: bunched together in this claims process.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a Native American farmers
claims case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one was specifically in 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was doing the early part of my
research is actually when the claims
[SPEAKER_03]: process was being processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 15 years later, people had to hear
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could complain if you had been
discriminated against while applying for a
[SPEAKER_03]: loan from 81 to 2000, which means that you
would have had to be walking into a USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: office.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see the paperwork saying, you know,
if you were discriminated, fill out the
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's already if you've been
discriminated against, you didn't get the
[SPEAKER_03]: loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't succeed in farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to ever hear that this is
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, there were many people that
filled out the forms successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say applied, but not successfully
because in the end, something like 90% of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cases were thrown out because they
said people didn't fill out the paperwork
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, of course, to me is really ironic,
seeing that what one of the main practical
[SPEAKER_03]: barriers that people talked about was the
ability to fill out paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, right, there was
acknowledgement from the USDA that this
[SPEAKER_03]: discrimination had happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they had the claims
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the other side of this, right,
I've talked about the barriers,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about the check on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about the obstacles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it always came to me that one of
the first questions I would ask,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, is, well, why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone familiar with farming knows that
farming is economically difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard labor, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every odd is against you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're US born, even if you're
born into a farming family, even if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have capital and resources, it's just very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you look at people that are coming
here with very little money to invest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little social networks, very little
education in marketing or business skills,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I really found this had a lot to
do with this sense of reclaiming their
[SPEAKER_03]: identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I was saying, also reclaiming their
labor and that having their own farm was
[SPEAKER_03]: very different than working on someone
else's farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they talked to me a lot about this
sense of recreating home, recreating the
[SPEAKER_03]: sense of life in Mexico or life back home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That once they had acknowledged that they
were going to stay here, that they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to make their life what they were familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted to teach it to their
children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was reflected, as I was saying,
in the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most farms were anywhere from four
acres to the biggest farm I think I saw
[SPEAKER_03]: was about 60 acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while they were not all certified
organic, they use kind of low input,
[SPEAKER_03]: low spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them weren't certified simply
because of the paperwork and cost of being
[SPEAKER_03]: certified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since the book came out, I've actually
been working a little bit with NOFA,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Northeast Organic Farming Association
on how to make all of their paperwork and
[SPEAKER_03]: their application process more accessible
to Spanish speaking immigrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes it has not been apparent
that they needed to have things in Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: if they wanted to reach this audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it can't be like five clicks to
get to the Spanish speaking form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be accessible from the get go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of them, like I said, while they
were not certified, they would fall under
[SPEAKER_03]: the broad category of alternative
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very diversified, low inputs in terms of
the scale of agriculture in the US today
[SPEAKER_03]: and small scale, as well as direct
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while there were some farmers in
California that just basically could not
[SPEAKER_03]: get into the markets because they were so
saturated, all of them preferred direct
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more familiar to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how they had grown up farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything from farmers markets to
sometimes selling directly to Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: grocery stores to directly to neighbors
and people in their own community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for them, again, it was this sense of
controlling their day to day, their own
[SPEAKER_03]: labor, as well as preserving their own
traditional food waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even in a place where, say,
they might have had to narrow it down to
[SPEAKER_03]: three crops because that's what would sell
at market, on the side, they would have
[SPEAKER_03]: their own, you know, milpa or garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So corn, beans and squash or more of a
traditional diet that would feed their
[SPEAKER_03]: family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no matter what part of their field
would be for their family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was about much more than a business,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about recreating this sense of home
and familiarity with agriculture for their
[SPEAKER_03]: family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually the one farmer that I
interviewed in the Ithaca area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who I've been able to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, you know, it's part of our
heritage that we want to be able to not
[SPEAKER_03]: get up at a certain time, but just jump in
a car and not just jump in a car and leave
[SPEAKER_03]: your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more a way of life being able to
raise your kids at home because everywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: we're from has their own farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single person in town had their own
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for him and his wife,
it was very much about that family,
[SPEAKER_03]: about teaching their kids how to farm and
being part of a local food system for
[SPEAKER_03]: their family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another farmer in Virginia who had a
really beautiful flower farm where she
[SPEAKER_03]: also had herbs and vegetables for the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, life in the United States is
very ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, everyone stays in their own house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People live by their watch and there's a
lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we were sitting in her
living room having coffee and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking on her farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's one of the farmers that actually did
own her land.
[SPEAKER_03]: The land values in Virginia are very low
when the farming community that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: interviewing started to settle there in
the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, on her farm, it's a little
bit like Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me feel the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same exactly, but more free.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the city, there's more pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for her, it's not just about the
practice of being a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the livelihood that she could
create there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is another farmer in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was one of the farmers that was
really in the Salinas Valley, like
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry growing a region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just everywhere is strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, his farm really,
you could see this very visual contrast
[SPEAKER_03]: between this very diversified vegetable
farm and the monocrat strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I like the life of a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily recommend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to love agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to love farming more than you
love money.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first things is you have to
love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do it for the money that is part
of farming, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So why does he continue to farm against
these barriers?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another California farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was also in reference to kind of the
question of why don't you farm like
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone around you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, they do it for the money,
and I do it for the freedom, which I think
[SPEAKER_03]: is a really powerful statement in the
context of people that have immigrated to
[SPEAKER_03]: the U.S., that have been working on other
people's farms, and then choose farming as
[SPEAKER_03]: their way to find freedom on the side of
the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I was speaking to you know,
I don't like to, it was hard in writing
[SPEAKER_03]: the book to figure out how to identify the
farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it sustainable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it small scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it local, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really landed on alternative as a
broad way to describe the farming I was
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is that it's relatively small scale,
low input in terms of chemical additives,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But not strictly, very diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was one of the most
defining features of every farm that I
[SPEAKER_03]: went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Direct marketing, as well as prioritizing
family labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that doesn't, you know,
back to the question that I brought up of
[SPEAKER_03]: labor justice, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you have your family working
on the farm doesn't mean that everything's
[SPEAKER_03]: equal and great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did not go very much into gender
dynamics, given kind of the nature of my
[SPEAKER_03]: methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most farms I visited one time,
I maybe got to know them in a market,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I was invited to their home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time it was the male farmer,
it was usually a male and female couple
[SPEAKER_03]: with children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was usually the male farmer was the
farmer, even though I could always,
[SPEAKER_03]: the female part of the couple would
usually kind of be like adding in all of
[SPEAKER_03]: this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly there were some gender dynamics
going on, there always are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't really get to ask about that
just given that I was meeting with most
[SPEAKER_03]: farming families just one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all that is to say, just because it's
family labor doesn't mean it's equal or
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case, I think it's significant
in terms of agrarian transition,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the family labor was very
intentional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did not want to scale up for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say, would you want to get bigger?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to, you know, have more
property?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to have more employees?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to grow more?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they mostly would say, no,
I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm happy at this scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be in a position of hiring
people like I was being hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, at the end of the day,
they can't afford to pay workers any more
[SPEAKER_03]: than they were paid, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still in the same place of being
stuck in terms of their income and their
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to do more for their workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while they would say to me,
oh, you know, I was a worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is some of them did have some
workers, some of them that had been around
[SPEAKER_03]: longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always give them breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give them Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they weren't essentially very
different employers than people they had
[SPEAKER_03]: worked for, except that they could speak
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they might be friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think that that just goes
to the structural constraints of
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture in the United States today
where farmers are not making enough money
[SPEAKER_03]: and not, for the most part, able to pay a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these farmers were no different,
even though they might have wanted to more
[SPEAKER_03]: than other farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, this leads us to a lot of
questions, of course, as research always
[SPEAKER_03]: does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So immigrant farmers, I think,
are really important to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's an opportunity for us to
better understand the role of low resource
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, of farmers of color broadly and
how to make them part, not just of the
[SPEAKER_03]: food system, but part of the alternative
food system, which we know is a growing
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a desire for, you know,
more regional, more organic foods,
[SPEAKER_03]: more local foods, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to explain what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while there's a real role for them to
fill because they have all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge and skills, they are under the
same pressures that other farmers are,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did see was places where they'd
say, well, the past, I started out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with 40, 50 varieties,
but I had to really narrow it down because
[SPEAKER_03]: the market I'm selling in, I can't sell it
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I had to start just selling
tomatoes to this one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: middle person cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pressure to be less diverse in
terms of what they grow was very much
[SPEAKER_03]: there, especially in more competitive
markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the West coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if they're going to make
it, oftentimes they felt they did have to
[SPEAKER_03]: scale up, even when that's not what they
wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to hire more non-family labor,
meaning hire people at very low cost,
[SPEAKER_03]: which of course then to this last point
reproduces some of the class inequalities
[SPEAKER_03]: and the labor issues that all of
agriculture struggles with and that I
[SPEAKER_03]: started in on this project, wanting to
find an answer or find some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think ultimately, you know,
the issues are structural.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think that immigrant farmers play
a very important role in our food system
[SPEAKER_03]: today, a very underappreciated role.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of ways we could be
reaching out much more so, and making
[SPEAKER_03]: especially regional food systems,
places where they are more easily able to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a part of growing and marketing and
selling their crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have a lot to gain from
that in terms of if we're interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: more ecological sustainability,
because I always like to point out that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're the farmers, they know how to do
this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know how to market themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know how to fill out the
paperwork, but they do know how to farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't something they need to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's one of the things that
new and beginning farmers are struggling
[SPEAKER_03]: with in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: today, if you don't come from an
agricultural background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I see is that we have farms all
over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: with sustainable farmers that don't have
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we make that transition,
I think is the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a quote from a farmer in
Washington state that I interviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was renting from a farm incubator
called Viva, and he was Mixteco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was an indigenous immigrant,
very young, still working his day job in
[SPEAKER_03]: the berry fields in Washington,
and really still just very passionate and
[SPEAKER_03]: motivated to go out at the end of the day
and do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, when I asked him, why are you
doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, if the sun comes out for
everybody, why have envy?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it comes out for everyone, it comes out
for the blondes, the Latinos, the
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese, for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun does not discriminate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rain falls for every farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a really beautiful image
of kind of hope in the midst of a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: destruction and challenges that our food
system is experiencing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, I have my acknowledgments,
my research assistance and funding,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'll stop there, and hopefully I
didn't go too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer questions that people
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Don, I think you're muted now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've all been prey to that fault
in the Zoom age.
[SPEAKER_07]: So questions for Laura Ann.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I'll lead with one,
which is, did you find that generally
[SPEAKER_07]: these Latino, Latina farm families wanted
their kids to perpetuate the farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a really good question,
and it's one that I did always ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found a mix of responses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They felt strongly that they wanted their
children to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to offer this as an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one farmer specifically said to me,
well, this is always a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always fall back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to grow your own food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a life skill that my kids
should know, because I know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of them, just like most parents,
were like, well, I really want my kids to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to college, and I want my kids to have
options and opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no one was strictly saying,
my children should take over the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there was any pressure
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they came to the United States to
give their children other opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they didn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think a lot of them felt,
hey, if I can make a successful business
[SPEAKER_03]: that my children want to take over,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did actually see some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some of the most successful farms,
they already had kind of college-age
[SPEAKER_03]: children that had been through the
education system in the US, spoke perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: English, and had decided to help with the
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were the ones that managed all
the marketing and the markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really helpful for those
families.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I had talked to a lot of farmers
that were like, oh, I have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's learning to be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a dental hygienist, and I'm so proud
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, if she wants to be part of the
farm, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not required.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there was a real mix,
like any parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want your kids to have options.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of pursuing that one in a
little bit different direction,
[SPEAKER_06]: too, that it seems like, really,
for cultural values, they're getting into
[SPEAKER_06]: a part of the market that's almost
impossible to make a living at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that seems like it's even more
challenging to get the farm kids to stay
[SPEAKER_06]: on the farm in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so looking at our end in the
agricultural education business as it
[SPEAKER_06]: were, did you see any cases where people
did like the farming aspects of it to
[SPEAKER_06]: children and had the potential to go to
college, but they were interested in going
[SPEAKER_06]: to agriculture rather than into dental
hygiene or something that's sort of more
[SPEAKER_06]: obvious ways to find a job?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you saw that, what was driving that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say there were a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of one in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of I think I could speak
to more to why I think I didn't see it,
[SPEAKER_03]: is I'm not sure that they know that that
exists as an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, I think they're really
socially isolated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in terms of what your options might
be after high school, I'm not sure a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of them were hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could be wrong because I didn't ask
that question specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't hear a lot of people talking
about if I'm going to go to school,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to really study agriculture
because their parents are not networked in
[SPEAKER_03]: with the same types of resources that our
farmers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I would ask in the USDA office,
how do you reach out?
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be like, oh, well, we have our
lists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if someone comes to our office,
they get on our list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, if people never come
to your office, they're never going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: on your list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think their kids at the same
time were kind of in the know of what ag
[SPEAKER_03]: schools have to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say that's my assumption because I
really didn't hear about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were going to go to college,
they were getting away from the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they were going to stay on the
farm, they were just excited to stay on
[SPEAKER_03]: the farm and help their parents with so
many needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they could speak English, they could do
so much to help their family just by
[SPEAKER_03]: staying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura Ann, if you look in chat,
you'll see that there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: questions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see the one about the Hmong
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think the attitudes might exist
among other communities traditionally
[SPEAKER_03]: farming such as the Hmong?
[SPEAKER_03]: So interestingly, I actually started my
dissertation work thinking I was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with the Hmong in California,
specifically because I had some
[SPEAKER_03]: connections with Extension in Stockton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are so many similarities
with these stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized quickly that I didn't speak
Hmong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I spoke Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really needed to not spend three
years learning a new language.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did do some interviews in Stockton
just in the start of this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are a lot of overlaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest difference is that the Hmong
community come in as refugees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the farm worker communities are coming
in as undocumented or maybe documented
[SPEAKER_03]: immigrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the refugee communities, and I'm doing
some work actually with refugees in
[SPEAKER_03]: Syracuse right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Refugee communities by no means do they
have lots of resources, but they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: different set of resources than other
immigrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because there are so many,
the RAP program, the Office of Refugee
[SPEAKER_03]: Resettlement has an agricultural funding
stream.
[SPEAKER_03]: For refugee farmers, and the Hmong farmers
have been really successful in taking
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of those resources, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of their narratives and
their histories are the same in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: why they're farming, why they want to
teach their kids to farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Minnesota, I actually saw Latino
farmers and Hmong farmers using the same
[SPEAKER_03]: food hub.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a relationship there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's something really
different in the refugee groups that come
[SPEAKER_03]: in and they don't work in agriculture in
the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they get back into farming
because similar to other immigrants,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what they know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it's really different for the
Latino groups that are coming in,
[SPEAKER_03]: working in industrial agriculture as their
jobs, and then getting into it without any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the networks that the refugees have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to say like one group is better off
than the other, because it's not easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: be in either group, obviously,
to start a farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they have somewhat different
paths to agriculture and different sets of
[SPEAKER_03]: resources and networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Hmong are just more networked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than farm workers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of commonalities there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I can't see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your opinions on how digital
agriculture would influence immigrant
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers and what could we do from
technology aspect to help them?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of digital agriculture,
I might just ask, with digital
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, do you mean like the ways
people are using cell phones to track the
[SPEAKER_03]: markets or other, maybe help me with the
question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Laura, this is Hugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of digital agriculture,
it's just a new revolution of technology
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated for agriculture applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, instead of using heavy
duty agriculture machinery, we probably
[SPEAKER_00]: will use robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as such different technologies
that can reduce the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just wondering overall how those
technologies would influence immigrant
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and how we could do from the
technology aspect to help them,
[SPEAKER_00]: if possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I saw was, well, obviously
everyone has cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have a lot of access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have cell phones, they don't have
access to capital to invest in technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that increases the edge in
terms of investment, usually they would
[SPEAKER_03]: fall behind unless someone is like gifting
them lots of money and technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see that there were really simple
technologies that could be helpful in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of apps to help them with marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually heard some creative ideas from
them, not necessarily specific
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural technologies, but the ways
that they could be using their phones for
[SPEAKER_03]: things like really simple marketing
translation, the more that they could be
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of getting a leg up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for them, they're really trained
to catch up with the technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology that already exists because
they don't have the money to invest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of robotics versus labor,
again, I think it largely puts them at a
[SPEAKER_03]: disadvantage because what they have is
labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what they have to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their family, they have
themselves, they are the workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they have that other
farmers don't have is that they don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to hire the labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in a lot of ways, technology,
unless they have the money to invest in
[SPEAKER_03]: the technology, themselves, which they
don't, it's hard to imagine how technology
[SPEAKER_03]: can help them, unless it's specifically
technology that helps them with these
[SPEAKER_03]: barriers that they're already struggling
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as other questions, I can just
go back to the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can see who's still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like, OK, so Elizabeth is still
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to some of the differences
you noticed among your respondents?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you notice that region gender years in
the US shaped experiences of becoming farm
[SPEAKER_03]: operators?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The longer that they had been in the US,
and I'd say the longer that their
[SPEAKER_03]: community had been established in the US,
the more established that they were as
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, the easier time that they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that was really different
regionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the community that I worked with in the
northern Neckar, Virginia, was a group of
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers that had come in in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them had been through the
legislation where they got legal status.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the 80s, they just had these really
established small scale farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had come in with very migrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had already kind of multiple
generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had more a sense of the market and
what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also owned land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just inexpensive to own land
in certain parts of Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That varied a lot with what I was seeing
in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in California, even though there are
many generations of Mexican and Latino
[SPEAKER_03]: immigrants, I saw that the immigrant
farmers there were largely indigenous from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were newer immigrants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, it's just so hard to own
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even really established farmers don't own
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rent land.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the whole issue of water access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were just in a very different
situation regionally in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: saturation of markets and access to
markets and access to resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were a newer set of farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just kind of two examples that
really contrasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really did depend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the same time, I saw a lot of
commonalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them, they still had the same
goals for their farms in terms of keeping
[SPEAKER_03]: it small and diverse and direct markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of other kind of
factors there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a region definitely did matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the next question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, from Richard.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many examples of Latino farmers
working their way into partnerships or
[SPEAKER_03]: transitions with ongoing or retiring
American farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same who are their current or former
employers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see this as a potentially large
scale pathway to farm ownership or
[SPEAKER_03]: immigrant farmers within ambition?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, and actually, thanks for
asking because I didn't really discuss
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that is the ideal situation
is I didn't see it happening very much,
[SPEAKER_03]: although there are some organizations
working on that, obviously, like farm link
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the incubator farms are trying
to be that middle path.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I saw was more that farmers were
retiring and selling to developers or
[SPEAKER_03]: selling to larger farmers simply because
the farm workers couldn't afford to
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had to be a really in the few
situations where I saw it happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had to be a real mission of the current
operator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to pass this on to my
employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really see that I'll take a hit here
economically, but it's worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I think that that would be
ideal to see that happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, I think the farmers in
a lot of cases have to be willing to make
[SPEAKER_03]: less money on the property.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it's not like farmers have
a ton of money that they're making at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a hard one unless there
were some kind of subsidy for that
[SPEAKER_03]: transaction, which that could happen and
that would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did that answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're going to meet later
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was all the questions I see
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got the opportunity to
interview a local organic farmer in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania because I'm working on this
podcast project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had brought up this article by
Chris Newman, who writes about indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: foodways in North America and talked a
little bit about how the industrial farm
[SPEAKER_01]: complex, the way that we have thousands of
acres that are in production for commodity
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, which is very different from what
these small diversified farms are,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a way of almost holding the land that
has been stolen from the indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers that had farmed it for
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if in your research,
you would come across anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and any ways that our farm system could
become more sustainable with these smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: diversified farms or if really because in
the middle of the country, the land is a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fear is that as these older
farmers age out, the larger corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to end up just buying it and
consolidating even more land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and that is what we've seen
happening is this consolidation of the
[SPEAKER_03]: land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I guess, is the question then,
do we see anything other than that
[SPEAKER_03]: happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is there a pattern that's going
against that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see some kind of positivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a yes, I think in pockets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what I what is hopeful to me
about my study is that I do not think that
[SPEAKER_03]: these farmers have been captured in terms
of studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I didn't talk about is the
ways that the USDA doesn't capture these
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the numbers are actually
much higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the farmers that I spoke with
are really off the grid in terms of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they usually rent from someone
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person they're renting from is the
one that fills out the census.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may or may not be reporting that
this farmer is just renting a few acres
[SPEAKER_03]: here and there because it's so informal
for many of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone, but a lot of it was very
informal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm hopeful.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely believe it's happening all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think as far as the kind of
resistance to our current, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: food system on a large scale, I do think
we're going to have to create more
[SPEAKER_03]: structural support for farmers like this
because they're struggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's happening, but it's
it's happening against these odds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think for us to have large scale
transfer of land, there has to be some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of structural solution to it can't
just be ad hoc how it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, and I think the social movements that
we see in, you know, agricultural social
[SPEAKER_03]: movements and, you know, immigration
movements like support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a large social movement
among beginning and new farmers that wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to see these, you know, long term
inequality is addressed, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from colonization to slavery to,
you know, immigrants today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's going to take a lot of
political will to make a really big
[SPEAKER_03]: structural difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't mean we shouldn't continue
to support the movements doing the work,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's, you know, I mean, there's a push
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw an article this morning to get
the Biden administration, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually support African-American
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think there's a lot more talk
about these things right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think political there's a lot more
talk and pressure and that helps create
[SPEAKER_03]: the political will.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hopeful today more so than I was a
few months ago about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an awesome answer.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to say, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a chance to ask Laurie on a few
questions this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't want to steal any more
airtime, but I really appreciate your
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you and I have some time later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I have, I have one more question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this was an awesome talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like the first seminar I actually
attended this semester.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just wondering, like,
what made you want to do your research on,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, new immigrant farmers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, like, what was, I guess,
the reason behind that, the drive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the, so it started actually,
when I was an undergraduate at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and did some work in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at permaculture and
indigenous farming systems there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I, I was really interested
in kind of traditional farming and
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable food systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I came back to the U S I
thought, okay, I really want to go work on
[SPEAKER_03]: a farm and try farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I moved out to California to work on
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did some in New York and then I went
to California and what I really found is
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than wanting to be a farmer myself,
because I recognized how hard it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: is I was really fascinated in the
connection between the Guatemalan farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Mayan farmers, and all the farm
workers on the farm that I worked with in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they were really like,
you know, they were all essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: indigenous to Central America and Mexico,
that they were all farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But that this one group was, you know,
farming in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_03]: This other group had immigrated to the U S
to work on like a big, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: organic farm in California, but they
really had the same background.
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about agriculture in the same
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, I was really interested in that
connection between, you know, small scale
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture in Latin America and then farm
workers in the U S and how do we highlight
[SPEAKER_03]: all the knowledge that farm workers come
to the U S with?
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather than just seeing them as
workers, how do we see them as people with
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge that contribute to the food
system?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of how I got started in
the path.
[SPEAKER_03]: To this project.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just yeah, I don't know my I'm like
first generation born here.
[SPEAKER_05]: My family's from El Salvador and my
grandma was a farmer then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the Civil War started there
and we're in New York City.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like now I'm like a new
transfer student at Cornell studying like
[SPEAKER_05]: plants and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because it's something I'm really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That there's like like there's just so
many different ways things could have
[SPEAKER_05]: gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I think immigration is in farming
is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really like the population that's
doing most of the farming here in the U S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now people don't really want to farm
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like this is the backbone of our
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is what we eat and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This talk is really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
