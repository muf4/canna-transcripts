[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I should go back a little
further, as you'll soon hear while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, that Alan and I pronounce about
the same way, which gives an indication
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm also a Canuck that has moved
south, not as far south as he,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I went through the University of
Guelph on my undergraduate, then came
[SPEAKER_00]: south here to Cornell for master's and PhD
and eventually came back in 1979 to join
[SPEAKER_00]: the faculty here, so I've stuck around
ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a fun journey and I'm going to be
pulling up stakes at the end of September,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's been fun being part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I want to share with you my
latest love, and that is high tunnels,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut flowers, and things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all these gadgets work, the topics I
want to cover, and I'll hit the first ones
[SPEAKER_00]: in fairly rapid order, is what are high
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know our audience is diverse,
so we need to go into a little detail
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then focus in on New York State,
what are high tunnels used for here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll switch over to cut flowers,
again, assuming that some of you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be all that informed about that topic,
heard the about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worldwide, cut flowers are not necessarily
coming from our local areas, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: within US and again, locally in New York,
we want to know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll combine the two major topics
into high tunnels and cut flowers and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we might use those structures together.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we need a definition,
and this is a fairly loose one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unheated plastic covered
greenhouse, can be made out of metal or
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely is, or sometimes wood,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat is provided by the sun,
so those of you in sunnier locations will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better time with these structures
than those that aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need to provide water since the
plastic sheds the water off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US and New York State are quite slow
in taking on this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably started originally when
plastic film was discovered in the 1960s
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Asians have taken this to a tremendous
degree, as you can see from the acreages
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, 2.5 million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that have traveled to China
recently, you travel through the
[SPEAKER_00]: countryside on their super roads and you
look out the side window and you see these
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys, you can't see soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just plastic after plastic after
plastic and it's mostly tunnels that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be as high as two feet or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture, I think that Bill
Miller's... I think that's my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole valley is covered with plastic
and they're growing vegetables primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also innovated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using the sun as a heat storage
device or using the structure as a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: storage device.
[SPEAKER_00]: These special tunnels in the middle
picture there have a north wall that is
[SPEAKER_00]: made out of brick or earth or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun comes up and beams in there,
warms that up and at night it radiates the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to heat the place,
but you do need sunny winter conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in New York State is a bit of a
challenge, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you fly over the Mediterranean,
southern Spain, Italy, Turkey,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece, North Africa into Egypt,
Tunisia, et cetera, all along the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mediterranean, there's tunnels all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Almeria, Spain, the picture on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the plastic is covering everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunnels where it's at and tunnels in other
countries are much more popular and much
[SPEAKER_00]: more pervasive than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 350,000 acres in the Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of area covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come closer to home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I didn't put in pictures of
gigantic tunnels and multi-structures and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on, but just to give you an idea that
we've got quite a few of these structures
[SPEAKER_00]: around these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimated between 500 and 600 farms
here in New York State have some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: protective structures, most of which would
be high tunnels of various sizes and
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are becoming much more popular here
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they becoming popular here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, part of it is a cost factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in the table, for a 30 by
90 six foot structure, a high tunnel will
[SPEAKER_00]: cost you about $3.25 per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you move it, it costs more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to be growing in the
soil there, you want to move it to another
[SPEAKER_00]: place, then it has to be more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the rails, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it costs more.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to greenhouses,
we're up at $5, $6, $7, $8 per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a cheap alternative to grow stuff
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information I got from the Rimmel
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other major factor that's been given a
big boost to high tunnels and high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: production is the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NRCS has had for years, and it's still
continuing, in each of the states a
[SPEAKER_00]: program by which they will give financial
aid for construction of a new tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want a 30 by 72 foot one,
you can get a 30 by 96 or larger size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will only pay for that portion of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's been a quite handy boost for
people who are kind of on the fence and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, yeah, we could really use one,
but I can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the way you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NRCS offices around the state can help
you with the applications for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is, as I've already mentioned,
we've had quite an increase in high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels in New York state with,
at this point, about a $6 million
[SPEAKER_00]: production value being grown in these
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sorts of things are being grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've heard about tomatoes earlier
today, and that's the huge number one crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that is very well adapted to tomato
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're familiar with tomato
production in greenhouses, the production
[SPEAKER_00]: in high tunnels is quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives the advantage just having that
sun assist of having a growing season with
[SPEAKER_00]: a harvest from mid-late June all the way
into October.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high quality because the rain has
kept off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these nasty diseases that Marjorie
mentioned are not altogether gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly much less problem because
you've got a dry environment in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're applying water not to the
foliage, but just to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 15 pounds per plant, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have figured that out,
and a lot of people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk to growers and say,
yeah, I'd never produce a tomato outside
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get five times as much yield from
the high tunnel tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's such a popular crop that
once you have a high tunnel, you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: why would I grow anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get into Marjorie's problems
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, well, OK, petritis is coming in,
this disease, that disease, insects that
[SPEAKER_00]: have gotten adapted to that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got problems of succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really should be growing something
else in that space to break up the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way you can do that is put in greens
that can even go over winter and be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested in early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these salad greens are quite cold
hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can freeze them stiff, and next
they'll come back out of it and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested and they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not too many people know about
Komatsuma and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a bit of a consumer
education project that someone needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: undertake to take more advantage of these
very productive crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumbers, colored peppers, they're all
good, but economically more questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't as productive as tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can produce a good quality crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of selecting vegetables for
this high tunnel environment, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some principles you need to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, what can you sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need some, if you're going to use
the fall through spring season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need crops that are adapted to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in hot weather, tomatoes do pretty
well as long as they're long as you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: good ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might investigate, OK,
I'm near an urban area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of people from Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really interested in vegetable X
or vegetable Y or the Asian folks and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adapting to what can be sold out of
some of the more tropical materials could
[SPEAKER_00]: be quite lucrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you can keep the crop in the
ground and keep harvesting, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got a consumer base that is
used to getting that material from you or
[SPEAKER_00]: a grocery store, and you should be able to
make out better that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, you can utilize the
space by something climbing, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also hang stuff from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you an example of that,
some work that Neil has done on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries don't like to get rained on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raspberries can be extremely
productive in a high tunnel environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that are coming this
afternoon to see our cut flower trials
[SPEAKER_00]: over on Maple Avenue, we'll see a high
tunnel with blackberries and also with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall bearing raspberries that start
bearing in about two weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll keep on going through October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has raspberries in October in New York
State?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardly anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those raspberries, you give them to a
consumer and they can keep them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't melt down because they've been
protected so the diseases don't get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very lucrative crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a perennial, so you don't have to
plant it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberries, same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I can show you those this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's work by Dr. Marvin Pritz and his
assistants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so bedding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, Neil Mattson has done a bunch
of work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started in our tunnel over on Maple
Avenue, but has worked with growers on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me 75 slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I elected not to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's sitting right down here,
so if you want to know about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: just talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line that he essentially,
after all the work that he's done on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is don't use them on cold sensitive crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's for bedding plants, finishing the
bedding plants before they're going into
[SPEAKER_00]: your centers, a high tunnel could be quite
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to choose wisely which crops
you're going to do this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it could frost in early spring,
mid spring, and you've got coleus in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be very careful on which
ones you do this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have a crop that you're going
to be shipping to a particular area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to hit Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years we get a real cold spring and
no amount of tunnel protection without the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get you that crop to flower
before Mother's Day arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a bit of a risky thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having that deadline can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use low tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we don't have a high tunnel
police that comes around and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said you have a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting supplementary heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put a heater in there and
keep things protected, you certainly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is flexibility there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some situations, it might make a
lot of sense to have a supplementary
[SPEAKER_00]: heater for those cold periods to bring
things along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would still be a lot cheaper than
constructing a greenhouse with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bells and whistles that go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some data that Neil shared for
one of the years in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a number of different bedding plant
species that he put in there in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flower date in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had these parallel experiments,
one in the greenhouse and one in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse, Angelonia, flowered on May
3rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high tunnel, well, sorry, didn't quite
make it because they did have frost
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to Diantis, May 21 in the
greenhouse, May 29 in the high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geranium, almost the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobelia, a bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes back to the point I was making
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose a species you might do quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil did a set of experiments with Judd
Reed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judson Reed is our high tunnel greenhouse
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a specialist for the state of New
York, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over in Penyan, but is available for
advice for other parts of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were putting, I think,
petunia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In hanging baskets above a tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were scouting weekly and we started
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are we having a problem here?
[SPEAKER_00]: TM-free, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: TM-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put other hanging basket type
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the bottom line on this one is
both crops came through fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them were diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yield of the tomato was not
affected by the hanging baskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lot warmer at the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is warmer in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, the temperature is pretty much
the same.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going into cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I was going to talk about cut
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 15 years ago, if you went to a place
to get cut flowers, you probably couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get much in the way of cut flowers in a
grocery store or a supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had to go to a florist,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what flowers could you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, roses, sure, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chrysanthemums, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carnations, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much it, except in the
spring you could get some tulips and
[SPEAKER_00]: lollies and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But domestic production was pretty much
minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced to more recent times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have the florists and even
the grocery stores, or now even much more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grocery stores, selling those four
cut flower species any time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blossom life, yeah, not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are almost all the flowers all
coming from here in this country from
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're living in Europe, then it's
coming more from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But domestic production is really very,
very minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have started to demand flowers
locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, that has
generated a very large industry that is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing crops like tulips, gerberas,
lilies, gladiola, irises, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry has changed vastly over
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The South American production,
mums in the left, I don't know what's on
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, they're growing them
in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in upland valleys, where the
temperature is the same all year round,
[SPEAKER_00]: the day length is the same, and they keep
on producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the labor is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowers are flown overnight to
Miami and then distributed all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's not to like about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And us consumers here like that pretty
well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have gotten into the cut flower
deal here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the kind of species that
are being grown and their production
[SPEAKER_00]: values in the table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big four are still the dominant
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're never going to do away with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get married in February,
you're not going to go to your local
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of flowers and say, hey,
where are my tulips or roses?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have this very substantial
production now of cut flowers that is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the States or even more
locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you a little taste of where and
what, large scale production of flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: still is primarily in Western United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back 100 years ago, it was Long Island,
New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it migrated out west because it's
easier to grow stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in specialized places where
the climate is ideal so that things like
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrangea have these cool mornings in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every morning is cool and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrangea loves that and grows like
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Kala lilies on the right also seem
to like that kind of climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's diversified much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture up at the top there,
Fresh Tulips USA, it's a gigantic
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in Virginia that produces
tulips about nine months of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's industrial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring the bulbs in from Holland
sometimes a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times a year, it's coming from
Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put them in their storage rooms
and give whatever cold treatments needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they bring them out into these
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just in crates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in some kind of special
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're producing millions of stems
that are distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get them in your supermarkets,
$6 for a dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody can compete with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of the sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is not exactly a cut flower
production area, but the Swan Island
[SPEAKER_00]: dahlias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily a propagation of dahlias,
but they have so many varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do sell some cuts from there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then parts of California, again,
have just the ideal climate for one
[SPEAKER_00]: species or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see large scale outdoor production
with very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the problems that they're having
with water these days, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not last that much, although this
can compete with some of the other things
[SPEAKER_00]: like alfalfa that they're growing with
that precious water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a more lucrative crop,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's get back to New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some large scale producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, within an hour's drive of here,
we've got some quite substantial peony
[SPEAKER_00]: producers up in the Geneva area that
produce peony.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut stems and send them down to New
York, Washington, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on Long Island, the industry is
coming back to some extent, larger scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, because the proximity of consumers
down in that part of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: dahlias, cleome, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a bit of production coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's more prevalent and perhaps more
familiar to you all is the small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: producer that has cut flowers as a part of
a larger maybe vegetable operation or
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that's just doing a few hundred
square feet or a few acres of cut flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that they then locally take to the farmers
market or to grocery stores, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about this whole trade
is that it is such a vast number of
[SPEAKER_00]: species that are potentially used for cut
flowers or cut stems or cut foliage,
[SPEAKER_00]: woodies, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very privileged to have the
authors of the Bible of this kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: with us in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard from one already, the man with
the abouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is Judy Lauschman,
who's sitting in the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the executive director of an
organization I'm going to mention a little
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wrote the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 83 species in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A vast variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been others discovered,
quote unquote, since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the list is even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's part of the fun of working in
cut flowers is that you say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use that for cuts maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some scenes from local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producers in their beds of Zinnia is
oftentimes part of a tour where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to visit them and see what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our production locally then is local,
seasonal, many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It avoids the big four because we can't
compete really very well with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the emphasis is on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also these species don't ship
very well oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fine, you put a bouquet together,
you take it home, you put it in a vase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You at least should have it for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what did they do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've already mentioned that to some
extent, farmers markets probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supermarkets, weddings, roadside stands to
some extent, working with restaurants on
[SPEAKER_00]: bouquet or other businesses that value
fresh flowers that have a subscription
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we're getting to the
high tunnel as a place to grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very suitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high tunnel structure is well suited
for producing high quality flowers because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow a lot in a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tunnels themselves are valuable real
estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you can pack in there,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you choose a species that can be
harvested over a period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows you to have quite a nice income.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an extended growing season because
you're protecting against frost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, you're protecting against cold
weather in the fall, you're protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: against wind, which allows the plants to
grow taller and straighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the disease reduced because
of the drier environment inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high tunnel environment is so near
that of a greenhouse that you can use all
[SPEAKER_00]: the tricks that John Sanderson would tell
us about in terms of natural enemies to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep things like aphid thrips,
whiteflies, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does allow us quite a bit of control
methods that outside in the field we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not able to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it isn't all rosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would paint a wrong picture if I
didn't mention also this quite personal
[SPEAKER_00]: picture on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: One does get snow events, and one does
need to be ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that particular time, we weren't ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disregarded the manufacturer's warning,
don't keep the cover on over winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten away with it for two or
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a phone call from the farm
manager on my birthday, February 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Chris, I've got some bad news for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, your tunnel collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are places in this world where
high winds can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Long Island Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you don't have your plastic
really pinned down well, you can end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with shreds of plastic all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so high winds can be a problem and do
require special construction techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not since not had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kept the plastic on our high tunnel
for the last, that was 2010, so the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five years without any problem,
even though we did have snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trick is to anticipate the
snowfall event and have a salamander
[SPEAKER_00]: heater inside the structure to keep it
warm enough so that the snow slides off
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of depositing itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has a peak, but it wasn't
enough of a peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a wet, heavy snow that
collapsed it down in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are ways to get around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what kind of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already mentioned we need stuff of high
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a long harvest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them early as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want high quality of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crop over the top, well,
let me just go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: High value, OK, so how much money can you
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like to compete against the tomato
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say, OK, let's just put some of
these figures together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a graduate student in Wenfei,
who some of you I'm sure know,
[SPEAKER_00]: put together this economic analysis that
took into consideration the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: building the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as what the income could be from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turned out that Lysianthus gave you an
income of $2 per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years, you got that tunnel
paid for more than.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflowers, just a single crop of
sunflowers only gave you $0.14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you wouldn't just grow a single crop
of sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd put in more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tomatoes come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of in between, depending on the size
and the cost of the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: About $0.40 down to $0.60 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kukes by themselves, just a
single crop of kukes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what kind of stuff do we grow in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some people try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foolishly myself tried to see,
OK, can we really do tulips?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that tulips have a nice,
strong stem and are much nicer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones you get in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, you're competing with a
flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard unless you've got
something very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that has turned out to be
quite interesting for us is anemone and
[SPEAKER_00]: ranunculus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses a dead time in a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plant the bulbs in mid-December.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are finished harvesting by late
May, June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce beautiful stems and
gorgeous colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really serious one that uses a
time of the year that otherwise the tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: is not really very productive for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one really to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other spring crops, more traditionally,
early season planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larkspur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sweet peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Campanula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Campanula medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't be out until about June or
so, out of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snapdragon works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaudicia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, are spring crops that would be of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentioned lisianthus already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a beautiful, elegant flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of different varieties,
different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look enough like roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the scent of roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that modern roses have much of a scent
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very productive and
lucrative crop, as I mentioned already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinnias, dahlias, again snaps,
are things that grow quite well in tunnels
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Celosia, amaranth, they're really
tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they love the warmth of the tunnel and
get enormous size if you let them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the ropey one that Alan was showing
us earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then extending the season into the
fall, you can get a fall zinnia crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it protected against the cooler
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snapdragon crop also does quite well
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've normally done more recently is
say, okay, sometimes our snapdragons
[SPEAKER_00]: overwinter for us in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the protected structure of a
high tunnel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we keep that overwinter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some experiments over the
last two years where we're sowing the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: in June or July, transplanting into the
tunnel, getting a fall crop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then instead of yanking it out,
you just protect it with a low tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: come back in the spring and harvest again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting 20 to even 30 stems per plant
on a nine by nine inch spacing is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of you that are coming this
afternoon to see our work at Maple Avenue
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tunnel, will have a chance to see
the crop that's more than a year old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten to be a pest actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invasive, Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other things that don't
necessarily have to be in a tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, but ornamental kale,
ornamental cabbage, the varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tall can make a nice crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture on the left is from Vancouver
area in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like three slides away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we've got all these species,
we've got all this stuff, we know all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, some of us and others,
they want to get into cut flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but where are they going to get the
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cut flower growers are not so
numerous yet that you can ask Cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension of New York State about growing
this or that or the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, luckily, we have an organization
which covers that area tremendously well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm privileged to announce to
let you know that two of the founders of
[SPEAKER_00]: this organization are here in your
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Dr. Armitage, before he got on to
other things, he was a founder and his
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student and then is the executive
director of the Association of Cut Flower
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers, Judy Lauschmann back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has information and literature if
you're interested in getting into cut
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, I strongly urge you to talk to
her and get that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ASCFG also has a wonderful website
with lots of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their quarterly magazine is certainly
worth reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual meetings are occurring in different
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had it on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regional meetings have occurred here
in Ithaca, but also are scattered around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is in Virginia, third week of
September, if some of you would be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a listserv where you can ask the
question, oh gosh, I'm having trouble with
[SPEAKER_00]: this Dahlia variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what might be wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody else writes back and say,
oh yeah, I had some same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, this is what you need to do
about it and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a national coordinated variety
trial primarily of annual species,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also into perennials and woody species
that the growers themselves participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide the information and the
website I've already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to let you know, this is the hottest
information just produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a grow local movement
and there's a do local and local,
[SPEAKER_00]: local, local, local.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the membership numbers of the
ASCFG since 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't think that local is real,
just look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going up.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most organizations are going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climbing and it's growers helping each
other, sharing information, enjoying what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the membership is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are all the families
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've mentioned already, Judd Reed,
Neil Mattson, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are high tunnel websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a high tunnel website here as
well, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work we've done on cut flowers is in
the horticulture wean research page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year of research that we've done is
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's books like the Bible I
mentioned earlier and the flower farmer by
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynn Bejinske.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also quite a useful piece of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all the time I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
