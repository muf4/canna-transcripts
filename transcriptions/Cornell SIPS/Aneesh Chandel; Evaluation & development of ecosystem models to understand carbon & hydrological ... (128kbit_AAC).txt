[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of my work is evaluation and
development of ecosystem models to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand carbon and hydrological
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we all know, soil, it is the largest
reservoir in the terrestrial ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is more than the vegetation and
atmosphere carbon dioxide combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a small change in soil carbon
stock can influence a big impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: climate or ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is really happening in soil,
we want to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand it, we use process-based
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several process-based models
being developed to explain what is really
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the soil, like decomposition,
soil organic carbon decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, lots of uncertainties still
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here in the graph,
no earth system models are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately estimate or predict soil
organic carbon in the terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to explain, to address these
uncertainty, I studied a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: processes in the terrestrial ecosystem,
like microbial models and hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first chapter was a review work,
which I reviewed more than 70 microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next two chapters, I studied
hydraulic redistribution, which I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to present today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, microbial model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a microbial model?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we compare it with conventional
model, conventional model, they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a microbial biomass pool here,
as we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in microbial model, they are actually
a representation of microbial model,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the recent, decades, because of the
advancement of microbiology, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a recent very high number of
development of microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the latest 2000 century, we have more
than 60 microbial models developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very important to review what is
happening in the microbial models
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put forward, I developed this
objective that is to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize the major microbial processes
incorporated in microbial models,
[SPEAKER_00]: to elucidate the environmental factors
influencing microbial processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to identify the challenges associated
with microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after reviewing more than 70 models,
I found that there are four major
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial processes that has been
incorporated in microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is microbial mediums, microbial
mediated decomposition, mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction, microbial necromass
recycling, and active and dormant
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One by one, I would like to explain all
these microbial processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first major process is microbial
mediated decomposition of solonic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several mathematical equations
how these microbial mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: decompositions have been represented in
microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am trying to explain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is zero-order microbial
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name suggests, even though there is
a representation of microbial biomass in
[SPEAKER_00]: the model, this biomass does not actively
participate in the decomposition equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decomposition rate does not depend
on microbial biomass, so I named it
[SPEAKER_00]: zero-order microbial model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next one, first-order microbial
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the microbial biomass was directly
related with the decompositions as a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decomposition was linearly related,
so I named it as first-order microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are several nonlinear microbial
model that are represented by forward
[SPEAKER_00]: Michaelis-Menten and reverse
Michaelis-Menten.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the forward Michaelis-Menten,
the decomposition is limited by substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: as here represents the amount of solonic
carbon present in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decomposition rate, it is limited,
rate limited by substrate, whereas in
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse Michaelis-Menten, the
decomposition is rate limited by microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then combining all together, most of the
microbial models, they are represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like here, we can see most of them are
represented by nonlinear, and only a few
[SPEAKER_00]: models were represented by linear models,
either first-order or zero-order model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the conventional model again,
conventional model assumes that the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition of any solonic carbon,
it is not limited by microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they implicitly assume that the
decomposition of carbon substrate is
[SPEAKER_00]: different than active soil carbon pool,
slow carbon soil, carbon pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: and passive soil carbon pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are conceptual biomass,
soil biomass, soil carbon pool in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have different decomposition rate,
but in microbial biomass, the soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, they have different decomposition
rate because some soil organic carbon are
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to mineral component,
and they are not actively available for
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they are not taking part in the
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if there is a microbial biomass in
the model, what is happening with the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some microbial model, they pushed
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They added one more carbon pool,
that is microbial necromass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That contains dead microbial biomass and
also enzymes secreted by microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these dead microbial necromass,
they have different decomposition rate
[SPEAKER_00]: than the plant residue or other soil
organic carbon pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of different carbon nitrogen
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some models also assume that some
microbes, they are smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the environment is not favorable,
they can go into dormant phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dormant microbial biomass,
they will not actively participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have favorable environmental
condition, they again switch to active
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial biomass and start to decompose
soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In microbial model, these processes are
also influenced and affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the models, they use three main
environmental controls, soil temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, and pH, with varying functions
to represent in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even these are very microbiology-based
microbial model development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, there are several challenges
associated with microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, microbial model core biggest
assumption is that the decomposition of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic carbon, it is limited by
microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some studies, they suggest that some
organic carbon they are very limited by
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic factors like mineral in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need some experiment to prove that
the decomposition of soil organic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: is limited by microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more observation data is needed to
constrain more microbial models parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third, incorporation of more
processes makes the model too complex to
[SPEAKER_00]: constrain parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, I found these four
processes microbial mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition, mineral interaction,
microbial necromancy, active endowment,
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even these four processes,
they are represented by several
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means same processes, we have very
difficulty and they are uncertainty in
[SPEAKER_00]: translating these knowledge into model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest recommendation is we need
data-driven model development and
[SPEAKER_00]: parameterization for highly recommended to
improve prediction of microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, next two chapters, I am very
excited to present my modeling work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hydraulic redistribution,
chapter two and chapter three.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the chapter two, I will discuss about
hydraulic redistribution decreases with
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation, magnitude, and frequency in
a dry land ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a data model fusion approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, what is hydraulic
redistribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydraulic redistribution, it is a vertical
movement of water among soil layers by
[SPEAKER_00]: route from wet to dry soil layers at
nighttime mostly, given by water potential
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can move from deep soil layer where
we have more water to shallow soil layers
[SPEAKER_00]: at nighttime preferably, mostly at
nighttime when we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And downward hydraulic redistribution can
happen when there is a rainfall and top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil layer have more water than the deep
soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So downward hydraulic redistribution can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not a conceptual based process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really identified in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be seen by using route subflux
measurement where we install some sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lateral routes and we detect water
is moving away from route to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these negative lines below zero,
they represent that water is moving away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we found the presence of hydraulic
redistribution in our study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one pre-location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magnitude of hydraulic redistribution
is still uncertain and there have been
[SPEAKER_00]: several studies conducted and still
magnitude is a debatable topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to improve hydraulic redistribution
representation in model, I used one
[SPEAKER_00]: classic hydraulic redistribution model to
process based ecosystem model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is TECO, which I will explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main purpose of this study was to
realistic implementation of hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution in a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the objectives of this study was to
incorporate hydraulic redistribution
[SPEAKER_00]: process into an ecosystem model
constrained by observational data through
[SPEAKER_00]: data assimilation technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to identify the key mechanisms
determining the presence and magnitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to quantify the dynamics of hydraulic
redistribution across multiple soil depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some information about the
study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean annual temperature was 10.5
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual precipitation 170 to 400
millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil type is sandy loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vegetation, mostly 60 to 80% is
juniper pinyon in our study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to implement a realistic process in a
model, we need these three steps to
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is first structure, which would have
correct representation of equation in our
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I added hydraulic redistribution
process in our ecosystem model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then parameterization, I used data
assimilation technique to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters to represent our study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And external forcing, like precipitation
temperature for the realistic projection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the TECO model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Terrestrial Ecosystem Model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents an ecosystem for a field
study site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the components like canopy
model, photosynthesis where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis transferring to leaf,
stem, and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these biomass going into the soil,
later formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have soil water dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added hydraulic redistribution in our
soil water dynamics module.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil water module was balanced by
unsaturated water flow, evaporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration, and hydraulic
redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important unsaturated water
flow, how water usually flow in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is represented by Darcy equation,
or also known as Richard's equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: where water moves because of this water
potential gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus one here represents the gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is moving among the soil layers,
like deep in the soil layer through two
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on water potential difference,
it can move upward and downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus one, it will always go downward
through gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this K represents hydraulic
conductivity, which was represented again
[SPEAKER_00]: by Brooks and Corey model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Z color coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parameters, I used data assimilation to
optimize these parameters using soil water
[SPEAKER_00]: content data I had from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this process, all about this process,
hydraulic redistribution model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is represented by CRT, that is Maximum
Radial Soil, how much plant root is
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated in the soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is difference between water
potential gradient between the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximum, the CI represents relative soil
root conductance, how much soil and roots
[SPEAKER_00]: they are connected with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RIRJ, they are the root fractions
available in each soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: DTRAN, it is a switch, because hydraulic
redistribution, it happens only nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this DTRAN has two values, zero or one.
[SPEAKER_00]: At nighttime, it will become one.
[SPEAKER_00]: At daytime, it will be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is controlled by solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is solar radiation,
the model will assume it is at daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the model result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black line, it represents observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue, it is TCO plus hydraulic
redistribution, that is modified model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And default TCO means without adding
hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we don't see much improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we see more closely, we can see the
blue line, that is modified model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is aligning well with the observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, hydraulic redistribution model
is not active all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find out what time period,
at what environmental condition it is
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see RMSE error here, the first
column, it represents the RMSE for whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much improvement, little bit
improvement, but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly at dry period, we see major
improvement in model performance for soil
[SPEAKER_00]: water, for volumetric water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, wet period, not much
improvement, because this dry land does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have very high volume of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is not moving, like hydraulic
redistribution is not contributing much,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving water from top soil to deep soil
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of dry land ecosystem,
water is moving from deep soil layer to
[SPEAKER_00]: top soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we expected here, we can see here in
dry period, we have improved model
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is total model simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we can see diurnal HR simulation,
hydraulic redistribution simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One note I would like to say, TCO model it
has 10 soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, it represents 10 soil layers from
5 centimeter to 180 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the representation how water
is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how hydraulic redistribution is
moving water from deep soil layer to top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we don't have precipitation,
water is moving from deep soil layer to
[SPEAKER_00]: top soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines, they are the top soil layers
of 5, 15, and 30 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we are seeing the
deeper soil layers, they are losing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also represents the water mass
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, when we have precipitation,
very little amount of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, hydraulic redistribution is moving
water from top soil layer to deeper soil
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is shown in negative direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like 30 centimeter soil layer,
it shows some increase in water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hydraulic redistribution, which
represents deep soil layer, means top soil
[SPEAKER_00]: layer is moving to a deeper soil layer
because of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we see daily hydraulic
redistribution simulation at different
[SPEAKER_00]: soil depth, mostly at 5, 15, 30,
60 centimeter, which I had data to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we can see when we have
precipitation, hydraulic redistribution is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have dry, water is like
hydraulic redistribution getting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: very positive side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is being moved from the top soil
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we wanted to know how hydraulic
redistribution is working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a significant correlation
between precipitation and hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the top soil layers, we see there is a
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a negative relationship between
hydraulic redistribution and
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the deep soil layer, when we have
much precipitation, high volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation, deep soil layer,
hydraulic redistribution is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: positive, which means at high
precipitation, it is gaining water from
[SPEAKER_00]: the top soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only precipitation, the drought
period in the environment also controls
[SPEAKER_00]: the magnitude of hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the x-axis represents dry spill length,
how long the dry period was between two
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have longer dry spill between two
precipitation events, we have high
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic redistribution, which means more
water is moving from deep soil layer to
[SPEAKER_00]: top soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then because this water is moving,
so we wanted to see how it is influencing
[SPEAKER_00]: overall soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have dry condition,
persistent dry condition, water is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, so a top soil layer is gaining
more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a heat map graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at persistent dry condition,
we see increase in soil moisture up to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter in top soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we go deeper in the soil,
this volume is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion of this chapter was
hydraulic redistribution improved soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture prediction, especially in the top
30 centimeter with greatest impact during
[SPEAKER_00]: dry periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface soil moisture increased by up to
30% during dry periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydraulic redistribution decreased with
increasing precipitation magnitude and
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also influenced by length of
dry spills between rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this ecosystem, because of dry land
ecosystem, we have upward hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution in top 60 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil profile became more pronounced as dry
condition progressed, with the rates
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from 0.03 to 0.2 millimeter per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third and final chapter that is
investigating the influence of hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution on carbon and water
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall objective of this project was
to quantify how much hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution is influencing on carbon
and water dynamics of ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conduct this study, I used data from
two study sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is from USMPJ New Mexico site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Meriflux site, where we had data
for soil water content at 5, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 centimeter and NEE, net eco-protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used ecosystem exchange data to compare
and validate our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this ecosystem also similar,
Pinion and Juniper, sandy soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: 385 millimeter average precipitation and
10.5 average temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the second site, Alpine Meadow,
it is a grassland ecosystem having mean
[SPEAKER_00]: annual temperature 1.5, annual
precipitation 760.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different type of soil, loam soil,
vegetation against grassland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have soil water content at 5,
10, 20, and 40 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model was calibrated using soil
water content and net ecosystem using data
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare both sites, the first one is
still dryland ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have very frequent precipitation,
not very seasonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the year, we have a small
amount volume of precipitation throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not see much hydraulic
redistribution in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly it was still upward hydraulic
redistribution, because it is positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very minimal, 0.2, 0.5 millimeter
water per day moving from deep to top soil
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this Alpine Meadow, here we can
see we have seasonal precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly at the growing period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a significant negative hydraulic
redistribution, means water is moving from
[SPEAKER_00]: top soil layers to deep soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is downward hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we compare a model result
with observation at US MPJ site,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't see much effect in NEE
simulation, model simulation, with and
[SPEAKER_00]: without hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red color line is modified model with
hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is without.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a little bit change, but not much
substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also see some improvement in model
simulation when we added hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydraulic redistribution decreased carbon
dioxide uptake from atmosphere during
[SPEAKER_00]: April to June by 0.03 to 0.2 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon per meter square per day in average
0.1 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this site, because of very frequent
precipitation, we did not see much effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of hydraulic redistribution happening in
this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we see second site, Alpine Meadow,
we see some difference in with and without
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: After adding hydraulic redistribution,
in the model, we saw a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement, overall improvement,
in model simulation R square value,
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.44 to 0.848.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we see at particular time period,
because hydraulic redistribution does not
[SPEAKER_00]: work all the time throughout the year,
we need some particular time when it is
[SPEAKER_00]: most prominent in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found these two time periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see hydraulic redistribution
decreased carbon dioxide uptake from
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere during April to June.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is early growing season by 0.07 to
0.53 gram carbon per meter square per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare with the hydraulic
redistribution, because water is moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from top soil to deep soil layers,
so hydraulic redistribution is reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: water content in the top soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the reason we see reduced carbon
dioxide uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we see here, there was a gap,
even in this growing period, if we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: gap of precipitation, we see model during
late growing season, hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution increased carbon dioxide
uptake by 0.4 to 0.31 gram per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: square per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can see there is reduced in
downward hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not much change in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we wanted to see how hydraulic
redistribution is affecting water dynamics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: At US and PJ site, we did not see much
influence of hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at Alpine Meadow, we see at early
growing season, there is a reduce in
[SPEAKER_00]: available soil moisture because of
downward hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hydraulic redistribution reduced
ET.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, red line represents modified model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is TECO plus HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is matching with the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydraulic redistribution reduced ET by
0.7 millimeter water per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion of this chapter was no
significant hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its influence on ecosystem functions
was detected at US and PJ site,
[SPEAKER_00]: likely due to two main reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of frequent precipitation,
there is no prolonged dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydraulic redistribution did not get
activated much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because of sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy soils, the water moves very fast
through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was not much retention of water
in the sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the Alpine Meadow, due to seasonal
precipitation, model predictions suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: downward hydraulic redistribution of
magnitude of up to 0.22 millimeter water
[SPEAKER_00]: per day and decrease in carbon dioxide
uptake ranging from 0.032 to 0.32 gram
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also reduced at some time period ET
up to 0.7 millimeter water per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the take-home message from all of my
three chapters, like first chapter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is microbial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest recommendation or suggestion
was to data-driven model development and
[SPEAKER_00]: parameterization are highly recommended to
improve the prediction of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: From second and third chapters,
precipitation pattern and soil texture are
[SPEAKER_00]: the stronger drivers of hydraulic
redistribution than biome itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we saw the same kind of biome
precipitation is influencing hydraulic
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the incorporation of hydraulic
redistribution would improve somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: little prediction of ecosystem functions
at extreme environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank my advisor and
committee, Dr. Lu, Dr. Sangtao Su,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dr. Scott Steinsnider, Dr. Li-Feng
Yang, and all my collaborators and
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have time, we are happy to take
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Anish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, mostly regarding your
second chapter, so how would you say,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we think about the potential for
climate change to have longer dry periods
[SPEAKER_04]: and potentially having those droughts that
are for longer, so how would you say that
[SPEAKER_04]: would I guess it would increase the
importance of including the hydraulic
[SPEAKER_04]: redistribution models, but how do you
think that would be likely to affect
[SPEAKER_04]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question is how it will affect when
we have climate change, a longer drought
[SPEAKER_00]: period?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, besides that we should include it
more in models.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like more important than to
include.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if we have more drought period,
I think that is beneficial to add
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic redistribution because as we
have more drought period, as we go further
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dry condition, the hydraulic
redistribution is more activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is adding more water from deep soil
layer to drop soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is only beneficial we have really a
longer dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if we have short dry period,
adding it, is it not also harmful?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also matching well without adding
hydraulic redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding is not harmful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have soil moisture data?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does top layer soil moisture increase at
night time?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the hydraulic distribution has a big
impact, we should see that signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the soil moisture, as other
literature says, there should be increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil moisture exactly at night time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see amplitude increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 24 time period, we see increase and
then decrease of soil moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not exactly at night time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our data, there is some lag,
time lag, which shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the hydraulic redistribution,
we assume it happens mostly at night time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is some lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil moisture is getting highest at 11%.
[SPEAKER_00]: AM 12, like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see there is amplitude
fluctuation of soil moisture without
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall in dry condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a question about your
perspective on chapter one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Michaelis-Menten style models,
when they're looking at microbial biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're usually substrate driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the activity is sort of dependent on
the substrate concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an ecological point of view,
we describe that as bottom up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're limited by the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another model where you could
be top down, where the growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: activity is driven by consumption by like
a predator or a virus, ciliates,
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a top down system, you are sort of
uncoupled from Michaelis-Menten kinetics
[SPEAKER_01]: because now it's the rate of consumption
and the microbes grow to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could change the efficiency and then
change basically the amount of necromass
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you encounter any models or are there
any sort of recognition of this top down
[SPEAKER_01]: versus bottom up issue in the models that
you explored?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no, I did not see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is more bio microbiology side of
a paper I have to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was more ecological side of pure
modeling work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think more time, we will need a
modeling side that needs more time to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate those understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sense is that they're mostly based on
Michaelis-Menten, but you've read many
[SPEAKER_01]: more papers on this topic than I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I value your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
