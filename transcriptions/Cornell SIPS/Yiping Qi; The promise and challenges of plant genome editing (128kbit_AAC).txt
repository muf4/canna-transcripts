[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to talk about,
you know, like Joyce introduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been actually looking back at genome
editing ever since 2009 at the post store,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cannot imagine time goes so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I'm really going to share some
results after, you know, as a PI,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of exciting, you know, progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just share some results with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, my lab is really working on
sort of genome editing, but we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: extend that more than genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually also engineer, sort of
engineer synthetic translating activator
[SPEAKER_00]: repressors to turn on and turn off genes,
which have their own advantage compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: existing technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we start a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk anything about this
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to do epigenome editing to
change, you know, the epigenetic mark of
[SPEAKER_00]: histone modification, DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but you have to keep in mind that in
the end, you know, even these epigenome
[SPEAKER_00]: editing still, you want to change gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather, I think making synthetic in a
transfer regulator is a more direct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, given today's topic and time,
I actually going to limit my talk on
[SPEAKER_00]: genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk more if you're interested
later, we can communicate on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for genome editing, so to achieve that,
it's rather easy to start because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to start thinking about, can you engineer
a very specific or tailor-made scissor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it magical molecular scissor to my
daughter, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's magic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can engineer that to recognize
any DNA sequence as you wish in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, whether it's small genome in
alibis or huge genome like in wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has been a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call sequence specific nucleus because,
you know, that's involved a lot of protein
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you engineer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because DNA sequence change later,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been a big, big problem until
lately when I like start 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or a little more than that,
people have making some progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after you make double strand break
with whatever scissor you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: really that literally just introduce
double strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA double strand break is a very
laser damage of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compare other breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be repaired immediately
before the cell cycle can be continuing,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of replicating DNA can continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two pathways, one is NHGJ pathway for
the non-homologous endo-join pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: which literally just sticking together,
stitched together, you know, eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: using ligase, like ligase for in fat,
ligase the broken DNA together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathway, in fact, I can't argue is
very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you wouldn't make mutation,
but if you make precise repair,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be recognized by the same
scissor again, it's gonna cut again and
[SPEAKER_00]: making, you know, repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many rounds of this kind of thing go on,
and eventually, and you will make error,
[SPEAKER_00]: make mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you introducing the
insertion small deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you knock out gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you I see in audience kind of use
that technology, knock out gene nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for reverse genetics or other purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but another pathway, which kind of use
minorly sort of in humans as well as in
[SPEAKER_00]: higher plants is for the homologous
recombination or homology direct repair,
[SPEAKER_00]: HDR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pathway typically is used in
homologous chromosome or histoclimatase if
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell is replicating and to repair
precisely the broken DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but we can sort of take advantage of
this repair pathway by providing
[SPEAKER_00]: adorno-molecular which share sort of
homology on the left and the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what's really in between the green
stuff highlighted DNA sequence can be
[SPEAKER_00]: inserted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy it into the information, which really
representing the precise genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about precise genome
editing, we more rest referring to this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this is really the pathway
has been hard to achieve because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: been utilized the minor in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started, of course,
this is a question we kind of wanna kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of try to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about genetically,
you know, if you can block this pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually pathway making some mutation
of the gene in this repair pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna shift the pathway to all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of one way when I even as
opposed to I did it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time we are not really lucky as you
guys have CRISPR, we only have zinc finger
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we engineer zinc finger nucleus to
target gene in the background of Q70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q70 and Q80 gene are just really the gene
are involved in this NHG pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in the Q70 background,
which means NHG pathway is abolished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we indeed, we found actually,
and we use the zinc finger to stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: the repair of HDR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed we found the HDR frequency has
jumped a 10 foot higher, but even that is
[SPEAKER_00]: still a single digit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually being done in
protoplasts, which means somatic cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really germline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we can achieve that, you know,
like a genome edited HDR plant is still
[SPEAKER_00]: open question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will save that for the very late in this
talk, mention this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we achieve HDR plant, which are
germline transmittable?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so start from zinc finger
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on we have talent,
which is again, the lab I worked with Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: Vortus group, along with other inventive
talent technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really didn't stay very long and
later on being replaced by CRISPR-Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently we have CRISPR-CPF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of today's time,
I really gonna skip all my earlier work
[SPEAKER_00]: with zinc finger talent, rather give you
some taste of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-CPF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I start my own group in North
Carolina, this year first, 2013,
[SPEAKER_00]: my poster Levi joined the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time just happened to be
CRISPR-Cas9 has already become a proven
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, even in past 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from there we look at, as Levi look at
what can be done, we found a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: can be further improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers still need a better tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of motivated us to do one
topic, which is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a system called a PCR-free
assembly of multiplex CRISPR-Cas system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system rather simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what you end up having a
sort of different step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a module of guide RNA,
which you can basically start with a
[SPEAKER_00]: paired oligo, which you can order,
you know, and then you pair them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you insert that into a vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each vector is modular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, you know, depending on how many
sites you want to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have three sites, you have
three guide RNA into different free module
[SPEAKER_00]: and using one single step of golden gate
cloning, you put together a called a guide
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA expression vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guide RNA expression vector is now is
also gateway compatible vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can utilize all the resource
that plant research community have
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated over the years of the gateway
vector you all have in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because gateway vector allow you
to have different promoter, which is part
[SPEAKER_00]: two promoter, which can be inducible,
you know, also constitutive or tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this promoter can now hook to drive
different Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have entering clone,
which have all kinds of Cas9, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: codon-optimized for monocot, dicot,
human, or anything, or Cas9 derivative
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, gene repression or
activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can really have them all in this
vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just three-way gateway reaction,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an entry clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two, guide RNA entry clone,
Cas9 entry clone, the destination vector
[SPEAKER_00]: with different promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're making a single tDNA,
you know, deliver using typical agro
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quickly, we have to demonstrate that
when we publish papers, how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, for example, you assemble three
guide RNA and two targeting one gene to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a deletion and one just making a
single knockout instead of five gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in both cases, we can show T0 plant,
you can have phenotype, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: bi-alienic knockout, very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also, this is my collaborator,
close collaborator, Yong Zhang Group in
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also wanna, you know, use that for
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what I showed you here is
coding gene, protein coding gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about non-coding gene, like small RNA
or micro RNA gene, or long non-coding RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, because that renewed recent interest
in this kind of area, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have evidence in this
paper, if you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we show that even by introducing a
small one base pair in searching deletion
[SPEAKER_00]: in micro RNA gene, actually likely,
you're not gonna abort the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro RNA is still gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one safe way to actually knock out
micro RNA gene is actually a conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion by using double-strand break at
this big five and three prime end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene and making whole chunk of deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can really make sure to delete the
micro RNA gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did that in last, is time up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right, okay, so good,
good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 30 minutes, so all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deletion, now you have 60%,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 29, transgenic, you have 12
deletion happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very efficient, and this one is 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it's very achievable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In rice, this is in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making deletion, now you can knock out
micro RNA and two-stranded function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you ask me, you know,
what about other rice fields people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been, you know, kind of use that a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the plant I work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no even paper published about
genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't worry, because we have the
tool, have a lot of Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like six, seven Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want my Cas9, you can test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, for example, this is a group,
my collaborator in Poland, Rafa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used our system, basically,
has visiting scientists come to my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: did all the assembly and all the other
things learned, and we make all the
[SPEAKER_00]: vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, here, just showing you
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this alabdops, coding-multimized,
maze coding-multimized, and can't
[SPEAKER_00]: coding-multimized Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you apply to carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knock out, again, the gene,
F3H gene, is involved in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this answer-sounding accumulation in
carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you knock out, we start with a high
accumulation line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock the gene out, it becomes
white, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, actually, this quantitative
looking at color cannot tell you how
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient different Cas9 you assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because literally, you don't really add
much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only on the last step of gateway cloning,
you're just using different Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make, it just doesn't really add much
work at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the end, in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can test a lot of reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he concluded this Cas9 optimized for
alabdopsis worked very well in carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another example is a collaborator,
Ken Wang, group at Iowa State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, again, here, just design,
just, you know, to guide RNA to target two
[SPEAKER_00]: sites in the GL2G in maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so should test that two different
constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found that the efficiency is
very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this guide RNA, we did 100% knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single plant is knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them, if you look carefully,
are bioalienic knockouts, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another guide RNA is 90%
knockout, also very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he basically, after, so the result,
she told me that, Yiping, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we published paper in Planet
Biocontroller last year reporting a Cas9
[SPEAKER_00]: system for maze researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your system seems better, so she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, so that's actually good,
because the tool allow you to optimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never really stopped making better
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this Cas9 CRISPR-CpF1 system has
been reported in 2015, I become very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested, for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just highlight a few of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this CpF1 protein is unlike
Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cas9 making brunt and cleavage,
three base pair away from the NGG-PAM
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know that, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but CpF1 is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like zinc finger nucleus and
palan that I have been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually making a staggered end with
a five-prime end over hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's right, if we're making three-prime
over hand, which is better for HDR
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you know, the stick end may be
really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, maybe we can use NHEJ pathway
to really sort of inserting a donor DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence, making precise gene replacement,
allele swap, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to be done, you know,
in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people yet published.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, CpF1, unlike Cas9 system,
it actually only utilize the CRISPR RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like 43 nucleotide alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CRISPR Cas9, we typically using single
guide RNA, which is fusion of CRISPR RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tracer RNA together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So much longer, like 100 base pair,
100 nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, CpF1 recognize the poly-T,
which is TTT, V-PAM, and which is a nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: complement to the NGG-PAM of Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CpF1 basically can recognize more
80-bit genome or 80-bit sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it cut away from the PAM,
which means if small mutation induced,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the guide RNA can still recognize
sites and cut again, which can stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: further, you know, if we pursue HDR,
maybe can stimulate many rounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I become very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, my post-doc, we dive in to
really developing CpF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we test, we just apply the
same thing, how we express CRISPR Cas9
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same thing as CpF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, in particularly, we express guide
RNA with U3, U6 promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That end up not working well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know why we spent time
troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, we compared many systems,
and the system come out very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system we eventually worked out
very well is what I call that Dura-PoR2
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter system, because we are using the
same promoter of PoR2 promoter,
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitin promoter for MACE, and to drive
the CpF1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we tested is AS and ALB,
because these two proteins just happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the one, show activity in human cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just follow those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also use same promoter to
drive the CRISPR RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the problem, because for PoR2
promoter, that's unlike PoR3 promoter,
[SPEAKER_00]: like U3 start with A, U6 start with G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to define the first
nucleotide of transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we already, based on our failure
with CpF1 earlier, we have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: already, I think that this CRISPR RNA has
to be precisely processed in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: retain very high activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, we use two ribozyme,
which is Hammerhead ribozyme, HDB
[SPEAKER_00]: ribozyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: For students here, ribozyme is
self-cleavage RNA, so just like enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, with that, so you can imagine this
transfer will be processed by
[SPEAKER_00]: self-cleavage after making RNA,
and then this precisely processed,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the final length of guide RNA,
we now we're compressed with CpF1 protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then act to recognize DNA genomically,
and making double-strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this is case really working
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I just show you a protoplast
data at six sites here, and where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see ALB worked very nicely, but AS,
half of them working, half not even
[SPEAKER_00]: working, so seem to be suboptimal,
but ALB is robustly working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at what kind of deletion
mutation make, and overall, both AS and
[SPEAKER_00]: ALB making over 95% are making deletions
instead of insertions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, they're mostly deletion,
and in fact, deletion are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: size are larger, if you look at sizes,
about on average is ranged from six to
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a certain base part deletion,
which is interesting, because for Cas9,
[SPEAKER_00]: we typically in rice, we typically find
like one to three base part deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this deletion from CpF1 is much
larger, which can be explained by
[SPEAKER_00]: staggered end, that's more end processing
after double-strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really exciting for us is
really, we have to show whether we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make edit the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making agro-mediator
transformation of making T0 rice plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and excitingly, for the plant,
we have surveyed at 100% knockout,
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant is knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really astonishing is really
that almost every single plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: bi-allelic knockout, which means already
non-allel, okay, because both copy of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome, both gene has been knocked
out, because rice is deployed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really exciting, and then this
is ALB CpF1, and then of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: then other research including Can1 are
interested, so we collaborate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which shows it's also working to knock out
gene in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine you have now another
tool, CpF1 for genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is the CpF1 not only prefer
AT rich region, but the PAM that the one
[SPEAKER_00]: working well, the AS and ALB nucleus in
human cells are really preferring TTT PAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search a genome, a gene of
interest, it was harder to find the triple
[SPEAKER_00]: T, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really limiting you and so then
when I have a new poster, joined the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: in show, so she actually asked question,
can we really making the CpF1 system more
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible for the, we can find more
target sites in the genome, in the gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, then it will become more useful,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of obvious question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you look at many of the,
indeed, there's actually quite a few CpF1
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, sort of recognized only TTV PAM
instead of TTTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The V just stand in any nucleotide and not
T, like ACG, okay, TTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only FN CpF1 has been showing some
activity in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at literature, there's only
one single site, which is actually edited
[SPEAKER_00]: by FN CpF1 is TTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the site is actually TTTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although other researcher claim FN CpF1
recognize TTV, there's no data backing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we wanna systematically look at
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we look at is, we just look at
many sites, 10 sites here, which are TTV
[SPEAKER_00]: PAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we design another different set
of guide RNA, which are utilizing TTTV
[SPEAKER_00]: PAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for FN CpF1, clearly, as you can see,
the TTTV PAM, the sites are really more,
[SPEAKER_00]: show more activity, this is editing
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's compatible TTV, but some TTTV
work, some not really working,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it's kind of
suggesting that maybe hidden rule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are dictating the activity of CpF1
recognizing TTV PAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of make us to chase further
how to make robustly working at TTV site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, we look at how CpF1
editing at TTTV and TTTV site compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the two TTTV sites,
and this is TTTV sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, they're making very similar
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a deletion, this is kind of where
the deletion occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is deletion size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look deeper, most of deletion
actually are kind of repaired by
[SPEAKER_00]: microhomology of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we also look at the specificity,
because one big problem is the specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be any off-targeting problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of us, you know, you know,
using CRISPR-Cas will ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to, one way to look at,
instead of looking at homolog sequence in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome is just, we can make
mismatching guide RNA to target the same
[SPEAKER_00]: target site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just make these every two
mutating, every two nucleotide making
[SPEAKER_00]: mismatch guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell, most of the guide RNA
abolish function completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only at the very end, like the nucleotide
at 21, 22 nucleotide, and you actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar activity, which kind of
suggests, you know, when we design CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA for CpF1, especially for FN-CpF1,
maybe we don't have to design like 23
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because 22 seems, 21 seems,
or 20 actually, may be already working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think it's still very
specific, because earlier mismatch or
[SPEAKER_00]: abolish function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at TTTV site, this is at TTTV
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same, similar conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but then we haven't really answered
why FN-CpF1 worked at some TTTV site,
[SPEAKER_00]: some are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of still puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, we look at, we basically
using this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We search rice genome to find the exact
same proto-spacer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proto-spacer basically just targeted
sequence of 23 nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just looking at rice genome to find
exact same site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, duplicate here and there are
different chromosome, same sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also both also have the CRISPR-PAM,
except one is VTTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is we are hypothesizing
adjacent nucleotide may also play a role
[SPEAKER_00]: of impacting the function of CpF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we call it VTTV, because only
difference is one is having extra T,
[SPEAKER_00]: one is lacking extra one T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the whole sequence is same,
but they are just located in different
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes, different sites in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we let same guide RNA,
guide it to recognize both sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to show you data because
actually published just last month paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have time to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall we found in fact, FN-CpF1
recognize most of VTTV, although a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different activity still, but they mostly
fail to act on GTTA and CTPC sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to design, if you want to
target FN with, you know, you try to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: these two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of one conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how can you find another way to make
sure you can target more sites in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides just truncate the, you know,
TTTV to TTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually Feng Zhang's group last year
have shown they engineered some variant of
[SPEAKER_00]: AS-CpF1 as well as ALB-CpF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to recognize, for example,
making the RR variants, just different
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid change in the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the protein can recognize CCCC or TYCV
PAM, just changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of want to apply the same
variant test in our system, what is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, yes, it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually also introduced the same
mutation based on protein structure to FN,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we enjoyed less success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, the red one showing is ALB,
RR variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, it worked very well recognizing
the CCCC, three sites all working,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then many, many sites of TYCV and then
different variant, but all decent activity
[SPEAKER_00]: in photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the FN variant are not really,
you know, that active, but nobody has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: published FN anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured maybe that's other rule,
you know, on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in that study, they also showed
the RVR variants, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which recognize the TATV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they claim also recognize TATC and
TATG, we tested both, but we didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: find working TATC, but we found it showed
two out of three sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both FN and ALB, this RVR variant can
recognize TATG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the data from Rice
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would not want to ask you know,
what about making, can you make edits,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stabilize transgenic plants,
or, you know, even without transgene?
[SPEAKER_00]: We of course did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this is summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanna, don't have time to run
through, but overall, I just wanna give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the information, like, you know,
whatever we see something working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: protoplast somatic serve, and then we can
almost deduce whether it's gonna work in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stable transgenic plants or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even, this R system is very reliable,
very much correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For things not working, you know,
it's gonna be 0%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I just wanna highlight
here, for example, this ALB, the RR
[SPEAKER_00]: variant, recognize TTCC, you know,
we got almost nearly 100% knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very efficient if you're not
targeting those sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, after this work, and
originally, we start with ALB and FNCPF1,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know they can reliably recognize TTTV,
which is like this many sites in the Rice
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with, you know, FNCPF1,
we define where, which kind of VTT,
[SPEAKER_00]: VPAM they can target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we quickly expanded it to this
many sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we further engineered those ALB,
the RR variant, you have this many blue
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, and then you have the, you know,
ALB's RVR variant, recognize TATG,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall, we kind of concluded with our
new reagents, you call Jopoda,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sites you can target, compare
originally, you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a similar analysis out of
doctors, more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wanna shift the gear to
off-targeting, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of you are really interesting
off-targeting, especially not only for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant research, but also for
biomedical research, like human gene
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy, right, of application of CRISPRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but one thing I wanna brought to you
is here, for the same journal,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature Plant, it actually published
controversial papers, 2015, it published a
[SPEAKER_00]: correspondent saying, you know,
it's very safe, because, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: so not very safe, not much off-targeting
found by whole genome sequencing of end to
[SPEAKER_00]: the mice, mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last year published another
paper, you know, like, okay, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found a lot of kind of collateral
damage, due to maybe Cas9 protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: seems a lot of off-targeting, a lot of
SNVs is covered in the genome of end to
[SPEAKER_00]: the mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of both system is they only
sequence one animal, which is being
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the statistic is the sample size
is too small, if you all agree,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, although they included a few parents,
you know, control, but even for this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, the control of animal become
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, you know, if you all read
the news last week, it retracted,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Nature published editorial,
actually, specifically addressing
[SPEAKER_00]: retraction of this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also published, like,
five challenge papers to show why this
[SPEAKER_00]: paper has to be retracted, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data analysis, how it's being
designed, not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this paper is being retracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting for me is
when you read the editorial, the editor
[SPEAKER_00]: concluded, you know, still, to this day,
there's still very little work of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at whatever animal organ has been
genome-modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at whether Cas9 or CPF1 have
collateral damage in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much work has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like they conclude that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, that's actually, that's true or
half true, but in fact, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually, with Clarita, we,
about three years ago, we already sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about this problem, actually,
potentially, you know, and about less than
[SPEAKER_00]: three years, but almost three years ago,
we started thinking, how can we answer
[SPEAKER_00]: this question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this question has to be answered
in a good way that then we can provide
[SPEAKER_00]: solid data to the research community or
even to regulator, like FDA or USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is actually we designed a
bunch of, like, 12 guide RNA for Cas9,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we collect them, we test those Cas9
protein for different activity in rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking from very relatively low,
like 25% of activity based on how many T0
[SPEAKER_00]: line you scored, how many are being
edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scored that efficiency, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 10, 100 line, 25 being edited,
that's 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have Cas9 in some type sites,
100%, every single line being modified,
[SPEAKER_00]: edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have CPF1 protein which being
modified at 100% because our system is
[SPEAKER_00]: very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then total, we have 12 guide RNA
for Cas9 and three guide RNA for CPF1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we did is we making a lot of
transgenic modified plant with T0 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, based on the edits,
we choose edit plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed them to T0 because some of the
edit plants still contain the Cas9,
[SPEAKER_00]: still expressing the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether constitutively expressing nucleus
where, you know, off-targeting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this experiment, the most
important thing is not like getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about getting the controls,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mouse study kind of lacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we really include a lot of
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we know solely just having
seed from seed, you know, from one
[SPEAKER_00]: generation to generation, by nature,
you will have mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we actually prepared three
generation of rice seeds from 2015 to 16
[SPEAKER_00]: to 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three generation of rice seeds from seed
to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also look at tissue culture because
the way we did genome editing is tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is agrobacterial transformation in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have plant which have
agrobacterial infection, no agro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have, you know, plant infected
with agro contain Cas9 gene without the
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA and also contain CPF1 gene
without guide RNA and Cas9 gene without
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA, all kind of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sequence independent of two line
each for these control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these four lines for these control,
12 lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then many, many lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total, we sequence about 70 lines total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just to give you some idea,
this is actually the analysis of control
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is we try to use all three
different software to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: to call it in there in certain deletion,
as well as SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be sure, so this is just look
at only use overlap for further analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, we did it for, this is just
for control, but we did for all the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data, first of all, we are
interested in whether we have mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, if you collect seeds
from seeds in rice, in our case,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found about 20 mutation, you know,
of in there, SNV SNPs, SNV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also about 20 in certain deletion,
half-half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, on average, 40 mutations just
from seed to seed, which has happened
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at where they located,
just randomly in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at what the tissue
culture introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture, in fact, introduced about
here is 120 SNV SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about here is like a little bit lower
than 100, like in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a barrier because we have tissue
culture only or also agrobacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: infection only and a backbone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems agrobacteria resulting a
little bit more in certain deletions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't want to claim that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be careful because we still
think our sample size may be still
[SPEAKER_00]: limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, you can tell on average,
you know, it doesn't really seem to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is on average, we show you,
a lot of mutation just in these control
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to treat those mutation as
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any plant being modified by genome,
you're going to express this level
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation, about 200 mutation in the plant
you edited in rice, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, what about our really
edited plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is stacking the edited plant
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This red is the S9, the green is CPF1,
you compare to the backbone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, on average here,
so this is SNV, this is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, they are more or less similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a similar level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at whether you have one
TDA insertion, two or three, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to have some line even have three
TDA insertion, but I have to say overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of transgenic plants only have one
single TDA insertion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of agrobacteria
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very limited number of copy number of TDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, we can find the,
you know, TDA, you know, not copy number
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really contributing to how many
mutation we have, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also, we happen to have a few
constructs, which simultaneously express
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cupric that will target two sites in
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also found that those even
expressing cupric guide RNA doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be, you know, having more mutation
compared to single guide RNA plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really there's no correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did more correlation, but I want to
skip those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but the conclusion is very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look at now we are limiting to
about 200 mutations, every single plant we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we almost know the mutation
mostly due to tissue culture, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: already found in the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still we can look at individually each
mutation, whether really they are
[SPEAKER_00]: off-targeting due to Cas9 or CPF1 or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to tell you only one site from
Cas9, we find evidence, we found a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation needed in those off-target sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because we purposely designed one
dirty guide RNA, because we designed that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we figured out if we don't
find anything, it's rather disappointing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed a guide RNA, which has kind
of off-targeting potential like PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: primer, not really perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few other sites in the genome
will be, you know, only one or two you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have mismatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed those sites, you find a
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sites can be luckily predicted by
any computer software, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can predict that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you it's good, because now if you
can avoid, the also conclusion we have is
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can make your guide RNA,
your second-to-closest guide RNA compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to your own targeted guide RNA,
if the off-targeting guide RNA contain at
[SPEAKER_00]: least two mismatch compared to your guide
RNA, you are very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unlikely to be edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on our data, whole genome
sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find another mutation,
another line have mutation, but easily we
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out that's from parent line,
because there's no evidence of any,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, similarity to the guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the mutation we discovered is like
SMV rather than insertion deletion,
[SPEAKER_00]: because insertion deletion is the
trademark of Cas9 or CPF on technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly insertion deletion rather than
SMVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are mostly SMVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's more, most like a background
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just happen to be overlooked from
parent line, even though we see so many
[SPEAKER_00]: parents posterior, you know, that's
variation among parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You miss, you overlook some mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is only one site we overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, out of 15 guide RNAs,
we only find one dirty guide RNA resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: off-targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the conclusion is very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna say safe, but off-targeting
is very, you know, negligible almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then look at the T1 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really find any, just having Cas9
constitutive expressing in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the guide RNA is specific, we don't
really have evidence of any accumulated
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's even safe to express them in the
plant constitutively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, now I've already covered a CRISPR
Cas9 system my lab developed and applied
[SPEAKER_00]: them in different plant species at high
efficiency level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also introduced you a CRISPR CPF one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, I shot the most
recent data about off-targeting and so far
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really promising, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a promise in my title, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use them not only in rice,
tomato, many, many other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, luckily, you know, recently the
USD have regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say we are not gonna regulate these
genome-based plants like small insertion,
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion, anything you can achieve by
commercial breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So USD also make that announcement
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All data are really backing that
announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the beginning, I also introduced,
you know, how do you make this another
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can you achieve HDR, you know,
highly efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, I continued the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago, I started it because I
wanna achieve this high efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everybody, you know, in the audience
may also agree adobo saliana is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: great system, right, for study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to conclude that it may not be
a great system for genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we learned it in a hard way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna share, I don't have time to
share your data, but this is what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: is we really tried different reagents in
adobo cells to really try to stimulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome editing in adobo cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is work actually collaborating
with my former mentor, Dan Voitas,
[SPEAKER_00]: at Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, basically, we tried a zinc
finger nucleus, halon, CRISPR-Cas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we expressed these reagents at
inducible promoter, and also constitutive
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter, and even meiotic promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to knock in because gene
insertion by HR, we tried to knock in a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene with VAR, GAS, and GFP, different
marker gene, a different gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: different loci in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we really, and we even using
viral replicant, replicate the donor DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried many, many things,
but we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, what we found is we find
many lines, some lines have very high
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of HDI in somatic cell,
if you take harvest or set leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you evaluate gene editing by HDI,
yes, it's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some line have 50% has been
edited based on the viral replicant
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we harvest seeds from the plant
to score them, whether they have the event
[SPEAKER_00]: germinal transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is mostly no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's rather disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have very little success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really, so that's why we found a
big disconnect between somatic and
[SPEAKER_00]: germline HDR events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disappointing, it's many years work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt not only for the money we spend on
that, for the people for the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people take things for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to do in and of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we better report even a lot of
negative data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only way we figure maybe to report,
get it published, maybe write a letter to
[SPEAKER_00]: editor, just because you have 23
supplement data are negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's one way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we write a letter,
we think maybe that's way to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some hypothesis, but I don't have
time to discuss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about DNA repair,
about what kind of cell you're editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, what we concluded here is
maybe the better way right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: achieving genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: HDR is really to edit the plants from
somatic cell, like cali is cali,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then regenerate plants out of that,
rather than harvest seeds from all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's different because you
follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, all the plants we are working
on actually mostly go through tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wouldn't facing this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of good aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I believe all the plants,
when we apply genome editing, more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to overcome their own problem,
relative plant species, which has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nevertheless, I hope you can convince
that we are at the end of the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: genome editing, because we are at the end,
because we have, for most of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have enough tools to knock out a gene
of interest if you only want to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are at the beginning of applying
them to many, many plants, which are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of exciting, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing is about how can you
make better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think another limitation is can you
get access to the elite cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: elite line like Monsanto or other agrobic
company they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have that, maybe literally
academic laboratory can do genome editing,
[SPEAKER_00]: make better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now, it's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can sell them in farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a lot of potential,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think genome editing can make
a lot of people very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether you can do that in germ
plasma, just quickly, a snapshot to
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration before I end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one work I did with a collaborator,
Daping Zhang's group, he has two labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in China, one is in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with them, I've been doing in his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we knock out gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been worked on many years,
CSA gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene, if you knock out this gene,
we use CRISPR-Cas9, in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually, the trait is actually
environment sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mutant, for example, in this case,
if you grow that, in the short day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen basically is infertile,
not pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing in a long day,
and then it partly becomes fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can basically switch the condition
and making the pollen fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's actually the technology behind
a two-line hybrid rice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice, because rice hybridized
conventionally rely on three lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a maintainer line to give
the one which are stellar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one can, you know, receiving other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we actually can make the same
line, just switch condition, becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: stellar or instella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually technology behind a
two-line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one way we can apply this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, the point I want to make here,
we can directly make the edit in the elite
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it in three elite lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just show you one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is JY5B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the elite line, farmer of growth
in the suburb area of Shanghai,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really the line the germ
plants people are using, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really apply this forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, a collaborator,
Yong Zhang, we worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, instead of one gene,
we can target multiple Q-tier gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because see the trait, see the size,
year that can be determined by many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can, you know, multiple,
using our construct, targeting many genes
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to look at, not only targeting many
genes, but also targeting those genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: elite lines, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, it's just like a three,
two, one, J-O, these two elite lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then you can look at, in this
elite line, you can get single,
[SPEAKER_00]: three single mutant, double mutant,
and then triple mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they evaluate the gene local,
because we, I mean, we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: allopdosis, or the model plant takes it
for granted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the gene of function can be
translated easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in rice, even if you got gene in
rice, in some other species, if you plant
[SPEAKER_00]: put in different elite line, maybe
different, we have to evaluate that from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, we found, you know, variation for
different trait to trait, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we evaluated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even same gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is, again, highlighted the
importance, not only work on elite line,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you must almost have to test them in
elite line to see whether really the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of trait is really good or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, with, before I end, I, like I said,
I don't have time to introduce any other
[SPEAKER_00]: tool, but, you know, we already published
three papers about, you know, making
[SPEAKER_00]: activator repressor to regulate the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is three years ago, and last year
we published another paper on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, repressor based on CPF funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong repressor to repress gene of
interest at transcript level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a year later, earlier this year,
we published another work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We repurposed activator, you know,
to make a stronger activator than the
[SPEAKER_00]: first paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: To activate gene, we even repurposed the
TAL system to make multipress gene
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested, I encourage you to
read the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make the resource available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, all the plasmids are available at
Adagene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make tools available to all the
researchers even before publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would really want to
thank, first of all, start-up from two
[SPEAKER_00]: universities and the company and the NC
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sengenta supported my previous research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sometimes forget to mention all the
collaborators in my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go too fast, but I really want to
acknowledge all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single, you know, project I
mentioned is a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without them, not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people in the lab did hard
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will stop here, so take any questions
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions in the field right
now is, what is sufficient genetic data to
provide a sensor for CRISPR, TAL science,
or CRISPR-CVF?
So when you think back about what people
did, EMS, data synthesis, you had to have
at least two independent modules.
So the question now in the field is,
you know, is it enough to have two
independently generated events from the
same RRNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it more appropriate to have
different RRNAs?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're sequencing data,
you have a very nice way of addressing how
[SPEAKER_02]: we should proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, to answer your question,
I think, first of all, I think either way
[SPEAKER_00]: will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you even design single-guide RNA,
it worked in your plant of gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, making edits, but, you know,
but of course, it's going to most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce different indel or whatever
mutations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they all abolish gene function based
on, you know, what they got, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the same phenotype, I think
that's fair to say it's strong enough
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to even the two independent
knockout, because if you sometimes knock
[SPEAKER_00]: out gene, get RNA, end of gene,
maybe not fully abolish function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, protein, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really varies depending on what kind
of situation you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, along that line, it's really
hard to address because the more is better
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: More independently is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if off-targeting, you know,
it's due to very much same formless gene
[SPEAKER_00]: you are being edited because guide RNA is
starting same sequence, maybe still you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot really, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but overall, trying more is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really think this is debating
anything from conventional genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: even EMS, honestly, because, you know,
conventionally, you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to make Y-type gene
back to the mutant to show it rescue the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you can show that, it will be
even better, even with CRISPR-Cas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They published, I mean, I, yeah,
so, yeah, yeah, so both C2T-based editing
[SPEAKER_00]: and recently A2G-based editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that reminds me, I have couple mass
review on A2G.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people following A2G
because David Liu published a few months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago about A2G-based editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I have to say, overall,
those base editing systems are lower
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency compared to, if you want to
know how gene are compared to just using
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR-Cas Y-type nucleus, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing is, base editing seems to be
over-promising things because it claim C2T
[SPEAKER_00]: or A2G change, but in the end,
in that window of a few nucleotide,
[SPEAKER_00]: any C can be changed to T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any A, you really are being limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to screen a lot of plans,
design, guide on carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you know, it's not great yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that still have to, you know,
wait to work out window, narrow down,
[SPEAKER_00]: or plot a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different application, but my lab
is actively looking at those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in quantitative genetics,
we often want to just treat things,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't want to break the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, I think base
editing, we have, base editing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lot of application for promoter
fashion, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other things,
or you want to screen a naturally evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-resistant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: By stimulating changes, you know,
across coding sequence of R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine, but to me, the system has
to be made better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with that, you know,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that efficient yet, it's working.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Lee, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the question, sorry, the question here is
usually when you do transformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get like 10 to 20% transformation
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you get even like 100% editing
efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we look at is we first
look at the plants, which are transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, sort of select already,
and among all the plants are edited,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can say 100% edits, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the one even don't have a transgene,
we don't count, because not transgene,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even have a reagent, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Joy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Cas13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cas13 is RNA editing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have less interest in that
because I have my own thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because I have synthetic artificial
transforming factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are really better to me,
you know, to use RNA cleavaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaving, you know, reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's other system,
other company are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have heard about, but those are more
or less like a CPF one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of your slides, you showed a
picture of pear, which is a woody plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for many woody plants, woody
perennials, they're highly heterodigous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And self-incompatible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you think of a way to get around of
this issue, like to get rid of the guide
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA and so extra not transgenic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is you still deliver as DNA,
and maybe you can find some edits,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just happen to be not stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can use, okay, you can edit
without the tDNA integration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other, deliver DNA by the gene,
be there, expressing the reagent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the DNA wouldn't be really inserting
chromosomes and will be gone, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after you're making a path out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can deliver with RNA,
but RNA is unstable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people are more using RNP,
the ribonucleotide delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You purify Cas9 protein, and in vitro,
just incubating test tube with guide RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you bombard with gene gun or other
way, you know, or nanoparticle to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to my understanding, those things are
being worked out, but not efficient yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
