[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, friends, for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing our semester has gone by so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dissertation focused on a
horticultural mineral oil called Civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And horticultural mineral oils have been
around for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might think, why is this renewed
interest in studying horticultural oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mainly because over the last
decade, we've tried to reduce our chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs onto turf grass systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And horticultural oils are generally
non-toxic, and they're a low threat to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So companies like Petro Canada that
developed this product are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: safer alternatives to commercial
traditional pesticides to minimize impact
[SPEAKER_00]: and satisfy golfer demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a quick seminar outlines of the
today's seminar, we'll do a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction on spray oil literature,
which goes back to the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the Civitas developments
over the last six, seven years and discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the many undocumented claims
regarding this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll go into the experiments I did
where we characterized response to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Civitas in the field and then brought it
down into the growth chamber to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray oils have been used in agronomy
since the first published article report
[SPEAKER_00]: was from 1787.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were plant-derived oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the development of crude
oil refinery distilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an explosion of all these
different byproducts of oil, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to figure out what they can do
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 1890, Cook summarized some work
people have been doing, looking at putting
[SPEAKER_00]: kerosene on citrus and finding out that it
had beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prevent insect problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was very common in vineyards
to actually go out with a 25% emulsion of
[SPEAKER_00]: crude oil and put it on apple orchards and
vineyards to help with disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those old compounds are really a big
mixture of aromatics and unsaturated
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons that can be kind of nasty and
toxic to plants and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've come to these lower aromatic,
very saturated compounds with narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation temperatures, which is pretty
much a paraffinic spray oil that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraffin is an older term for alkane,
if you're more used to that terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fully saturated carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the consequences of spray oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first obvious advantage is that we see
control of insect pests mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're actually seeing there's some
impact on pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a low environmental impact and
low human toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the disadvantages, however,
are they don't guarantee control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll have breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you won't have great control
with the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always the potential for phyto
toxicity, even with the most refined spray
[SPEAKER_00]: oils that we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture of a conifer that was
sprayed with a dormant application of a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray oil in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sprayed too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature heated it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said some strong phyto toxicity in
this conifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's common across all different crops
that these phyto toxicity can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that these hort oils are
really good spray adjuvants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing them with traditional
herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides at
[SPEAKER_00]: lower rates, we see better control because
these products help to get the pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant, usually helping to get it
through the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of a turf grass plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was surrounded by dollar spot
sclerotinia homiocarpa, then mixed with
[SPEAKER_00]: half of the low labeled rate of a really
low impact fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting really good control of
that dollar spot disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But phyto toxicity can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the literature,
there's kind of two types of phyto
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's acute phyto toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's direct damage to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaf lesions are common.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have fruit, you have summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what it comes down to is the
membranes themselves are being damaged by
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally more true of the older
chemistries that had a lot of aromatics in
[SPEAKER_00]: them and a lot of unsaturated,
highly reactive hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hort culture oils today generally classify
it as chronically phyto toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a decrease in growth, decrease in
photosynthesis, transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mainly occurs because the oil
persists on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it blocks the stomates and inhibits
gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have all kinds of feedbacks then
that's going to suppress these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now more generally about Civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developed in the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's developed from food grade
isoparafins, which they use to make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from cosmetics and lubrication
to equipment that's used for food
[SPEAKER_00]: processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was labeled as a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, it also got OMRI certified by the
Organic Materials Research Institute as a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great for its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has limited fungistatic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that makes Civitas
different, at least in the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the other horticulture oils is
it's been found to induce systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So application of this product primes
genes in the plant defense pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when a pathogen attacks,
the plant is really easily, quickly to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to that pathogen attack and
suppress the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why isn't everybody using this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an OMRI certified product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps out with all kinds of myriads of
disease issues and insect pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of anecdotal claims that
came out when the product was first
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest one was golf course
superintendents thought that their
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield on their putting greens had
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that an increase in clipping
yield can be negative on a turf grass
[SPEAKER_00]: health standpoint because it depletes
storage carbohydrates that could be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to help recover from stress in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other big thing for
superintendents is it reduced ball roll
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture of a guy measuring
ball roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty simple little device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lift it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to 20 degrees, the ball rolls
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see how far it rolls on the
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although that may seem like a silly
thing, that's really important to golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golfers associate fast ball roll distances
with really nice, high quality facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So superintendents try to maximize ball
roll and limit practices that might
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow hinder ball roll distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted this look in the grow
chambers to kind of see, is the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: actually growing faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a time lapse to kind of show
that it appears that there is an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in a leaf elongation with the civet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The civet has treatment compared to the
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super dramatic, but it is seem to
be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also measured this in the field
at putting green high turf with some time
[SPEAKER_00]: lapse photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the other reason people that this
product doesn't use that often or is
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling to gain exceptions is because
it is phyto toxic to turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the top left corner
there, the civet plot, it's a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to see with the projected,
but it's a little bit, more brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less healthy than the
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the company solves this by mixing
in a green pigment to just paint the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really helps to minimize that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the onset, we had a lot of different
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really difficult to figure out
how exactly we're going to proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came here with all these different
anecdotal claims, like a disco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I needed to try to figure out some
kind of way to link all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: responses into a dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after I've gone through about
probably 15 different experiments in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, in the growth chamber, in the
greenhouse, over the last six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been finally able to take those
experiments and try to make sense of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first quantified the response of
civetas in the field by measuring ball
[SPEAKER_00]: roll, clipping yield, and surface
characteristics like density and canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature on a fairly regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we got a good sense of what's
going on in the field, we were able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the growth chamber, look at
phytotoxicity, and try to understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a direct damage for an acute
phytotoxicity, or is it more of a chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we expounded upon that, looking at
gas exchange, because most of these modern
[SPEAKER_00]: oils have been found to inhibit gas
exchange and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, if we're inhibiting gas
exchange, what does that do to the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics of turf grass plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my second chapter of my
dissertation, we're quantifying just the
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield and the ball roll distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the main objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of look at clipping yield
and ball roll for 10 days after we applied
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did that six times over the
course of two seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also wanted to look at some kind
of mitigation strategy, if there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in ball roll, so that this
product can gain acceptance in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hypothesis was that ball roll
decreased and that was seen in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was inversely related to the increase
in clipping yield with civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were hoping that the plant growth
regulator, tranexipac ethyl, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly used to inhibit cell elongation,
might actually mitigate that decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these field experiments,
I'll just kind of set them up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're done on a bluegrass lane on a
bentgrass annual bluegrass putting green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were maintained to standard
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the clipping yield response study,
again, we had six 10-day runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected clippings every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to evaluate the different
components of civitas individually to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a better sense of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the civitas oil by itself,
the harmonizer oil, pigment by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the mix of the two, which the company
is referred to in the industry as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupac, because you mix it on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recently, the company,
Patrick Canada, developed civitas one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is mixed at the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a different emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have a little bit different
properties, which we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ball roll measurement then kind of
mirrored the clipping yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just done on a separate putting
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at ball roll distance over
the course of a day and then across six
[SPEAKER_00]: 10-day runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we eliminated the treatments here to
just the control, the Tupac, the one-pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: civitas one, and then with and without
this growth regulator, tranexipac ethyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: which reduces plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of a look at what it looks
like in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The civitas and then the Tupac mixing the
two together, and then the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the harmonizer by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the clipping yield, we found that
every time we applied oil, we had an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in clipping yield, whereas the
harmonizer did increase clipping yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: the control, obviously, the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two hypotheses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's growing faster, and that's why
there's more clipping yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of supported by our time
lapse measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other hypotheses, though, is that the
oil itself may be contributing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only talking about, you know,
milligrams of tissue difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's probably some combination of
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the oil's gotten down into the
canopy, into the verdure, and so not all
[SPEAKER_00]: of it's stuck on the word of the glass
actually being clipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to actually just say that
the clipping yield increase is only an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of increased growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we looked at ball roll distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that, in fact, the ball roll
distances did decline with the civitas
[SPEAKER_00]: 2-pack and even more with the civitas
1-pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are practically significant
differences and statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is at a level that may not be
acceptable to Gulf War superintendents in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gulfing public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasted for all 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an increase in ball roll as each
run progressed because the plots were
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we were rolling in every single
day, we increased surface uniformity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ball would roll farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's no interaction with
the plant growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth regulator only increased
ball roll by about 7 centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't even significant or
practically significant in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golfers can't perceive that small of an
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth regulator didn't help out,
although it did counter the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: increase with the civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so if you look at this data,
you look at the clipping yield data from
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous slide, you would then as
though assume that as you had more
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield, you were going to have
slower ball roll distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a correlation to see that as in
fact the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out it's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been combined across all
different days, but it was also done for
[SPEAKER_00]: each day, each measurement within a day,
on each run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only like a handful of
occasions where there was a correlation of
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield and ball roll distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is important because
literature suggests that ball roll
[SPEAKER_00]: distance is correlated with clipping
yield, but they never actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at clipping yield, and then they
use a product that looks at, they'll put
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll see the grass grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll see the ball roll goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just assume that,
oh, the ball roll went down because the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass grew faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they never actually do the
correlations to prove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's some work that
could be done there to better understand
[SPEAKER_00]: this, because there's got to be some other
factors high for leaf elongation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing ball roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the leaf friction, the firmness of
the surface, there's something we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so essential to management of
golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civitas increased clipping yield,
which may have potential implications for
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing carbohydrate levels in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ball roll increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civitas did reduce the ball roll,
which could be a problem for high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: putting surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their plant growth regulators just
didn't have enough of an effect to really
[SPEAKER_00]: cancel out that decline in ball roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at the effect of that
decline in ball roll distance with
[SPEAKER_00]: civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we looked at the chronic
phytotoxicity with civitas by first
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing it in the field,
and then isolating the cause in the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesized, due to the nature of
this oil, that civitas will reduce gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, which is going to cause a
chronic phytotoxicity, and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonizer masks this effect in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we had another study at
Bluegrass Land, the same putting greens we
[SPEAKER_00]: described previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a two-by-two factorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have civitas, the control in civitas,
and then the oil by itself, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and the civitas, the pigment by
itself, and then the oil and the pigment
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then turfgrass quality rating,
which kind of looks at the uniformity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface, the color, the density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much subjective, but it's also
very repeatable at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at chlorophyll index with CM1000
to get a sense of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll in the leaves, and campy
temperature with a FLIR camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the study,
we did tiller density counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of a picture of what this
phytotoxicity looks like at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: this growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the control, it looks a
little thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the end of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poll is annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual bluegrass is starting to be
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the harmonizer on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pigmentation really helps the surface
look a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also suspect that it actually helps
the plant to cope with some of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: stress during the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The civitas, then, had the typical
chlorotic appearance, some general
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning going on, starting to have a
decrease in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tupac, again, had that same
thinning, but then it was still just
[SPEAKER_00]: painted green with this harmonizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where the grass did die,
it was very obvious by these little flecks
[SPEAKER_00]: of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked more specifically at how it
changed over the course of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at temperature with a FLIR
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see where the control
plots are versus the pigment and the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mixture of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find that there's an increase in
temperature with the oil and the pigment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you may expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely a function of solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's sunnier out, there's larger
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was cloudy or raining or cool,
generally, there was no differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although this may seem significant,
the canopy temperature increase is only,
[SPEAKER_00]: on average, a half a degree warmer with
civitas and one degree warmer with civitas
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even on the sunniest, hottest day in
the summer, that increase was only 2
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really may not be that
physiologically important to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: small increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does suggest there may be something
going on, like reduced transpiration with
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the final toxicity with the
quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality, this bottom line here with
this dash red is the civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the first year,
it was below the acceptable level of 6 for
[SPEAKER_00]: a majority of the summer of the year,
whereas the pigment civitas, the solid red
[SPEAKER_00]: line, was at or above the level of the
control the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing in 2013 was the
Tupac declined at the end of the year to a
[SPEAKER_00]: level that was unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw that in the last picture with
the thinning of the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hypothesis is this harmonizer is
actually just more masking this final
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in 2012, we didn't have the
thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had the chlorosis, which was
masked by the harmonizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in 2013, we had the chlorosis and
then the eventual decline in density,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then obviously can't be masked by a
green pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're applied every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the study, too, we did
density counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that a definite decline in
stand density, number of tillers with the
[SPEAKER_00]: civitas and the Tupac treatment compared
to the control and the harmonizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely some definite final
toxicity happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to figure out why is this
happening, what causes final toxicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: with some implications of reduced gas
exchange, with an increase in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how would that affect both synthesis
and respiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how would that affect carbohydrate
pools?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then went into the growth chambers
in Wild Hall for the rest of my
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments we'll be discussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to kind of get it set up,
all the experiments happened in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions unless they were
otherwise noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 degrees C during the day, 20 degrees C
at night, about 500 micromoles of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic reactive radiation per
meter squared per second for 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we established these cones of
annual bluegrass for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they were dense and looking like
this, then the experiments happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were fertilized weekly with a low
rate of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding final toxicity is a bunch
of small little experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just kind of go through these
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked first at membrane disruption
because that's a sign of acute final
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to measure that, we just looked at
electrolyte leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there was no treatment
differences relative to the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing that, in fact, these civetos isn't
acutely phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't damage the plant anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, there was an increase or
decrease in electrolyte leakage with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment, although all the values are
really minimal, which would suggest that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe we can explain that because
when you measure electrolyte leakage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you measure the electrical conductivity of
water that's got tissues floating in it
[SPEAKER_00]: for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you autoclave that tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you measure it again to see what the
potential amount of electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what happens is the pigment
with this huge chelated copper compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably drops that copper out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it increases the denominator of
the equation and dilutes the electrolyte
[SPEAKER_00]: leakage number just because you're losing
the chelation of that copper ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we want to look at scanning electron
microscopy of some turf grass leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with civetos 24 hours after
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, again, 48 hours after
application, after a second application of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that there's some definite
signs of change in the morphology of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuticle, where we have these nice
platelets in the control that degrades
[SPEAKER_00]: down and becomes more flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see oil persisting on the stomata,
which may affect gas exchange and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: may be beneficial to pesticide absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that the cuticle is being
modified in morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to verify that it wasn't
changing in quantity or composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we extracted the cuticle off of leaves
treated with the five different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: components of civetos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found in the top total ion
chromatograph, these represent a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the waxy components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are all primary alcohols
ranging from 22 to 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predominant one was a C26 primary
alcohol, hexacosanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that level didn't change with our
response to the civetos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, however, a really pronounced
civetos signature that was found on all
[SPEAKER_00]: the total ion chromatograms from the GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at it from a mole to mole
ratio of the total moles of civetos versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the total mole of the one hexacosanol,
we find that there's between 9 and 17
[SPEAKER_00]: times the amount of waxy oil substance on
these cuticles than there would be if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were just, if they're natural and not
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we did some gas exchange
measurements with a Lycor chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an Arabidopsis set up so we can
drop our cone right in there and adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the light intensity and make light
response curves and ACI curves really
[SPEAKER_00]: simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just look at photosynthesis and
resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that civetos reduced
radiation use efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The civetos one, the blue line,
was more injurious than the civetos two
[SPEAKER_00]: pack or civetos by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pigment had no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is only done 24 hours after
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to, we repeated this
experiment to get a better sense of how
[SPEAKER_00]: gas change is being affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just looking at phytotoxicity,
we determined that acute phytotoxicity did
[SPEAKER_00]: not occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wax, the apicuticle wax
composition and content was unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there were some signs of chronic
phytotoxicity resulting from that
[SPEAKER_00]: persistence of the oil, which is
inhibiting gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more research was required to figure
out how long does that actually last?
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed the next chapter of a
thesis dissertation to look at how civetos
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a lot higher, a larger
level of measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these gas exchange systems are really
great because they're super powerful and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make carbon assimilation or
transpiration response curves to factors
[SPEAKER_00]: such as photon flux gradient, which is Q,
or ambient CO2 or internal CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: CA and CI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm doing canopy level things,
I have to do CA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't actually calculate CI because of
the, you can't measure an individual leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: of turf grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at under different vapor
pressure gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from those models, we can
estimate things like quantum yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: rubisco activity and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do these devices actually work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just kind of a graph of a light
response curve that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my stability be kind of quick so I
could fit it in the course of 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens here on the x-axis,
you have the time and then full synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and transpiration on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cone gets put in, it's at 500
par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that stabilizes,
the machine automatically increases light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity to 2000 and then it responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it comes down to a stable level,
which I defined in here, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely stable for this example,
then the machine proceeds to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the case of a CI curve, reduce the
level of carbon dioxide in the chamber to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure full synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can plot all those points
where it makes a measurement and we get
[SPEAKER_00]: these great light response curves that
tell us a lot of interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The y-intercept talks about the maximum
rate of respiration, light compensation
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That initial slope represents quantum
yield or the amount of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules fixed per photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plateau represents the maximum
photosynthetic capacity of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that decay is a result of either gas
diffusion inhibition or IUBP regeneration
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the previous experiment where we
showed the light response curve just to
[SPEAKER_00]: the simple ANOVA, in these experiments we
used regression analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to then do regression
and solve for, respiration, the A-max
[SPEAKER_00]: term, and the apparent quantum
efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other great thing, too, is we can look
at the transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because transpiration is a factor of
leaf conductance times the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit, which we can fix with the LICOR,
we can assume that transpiration rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf conductance are a good proxy for each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can get to our questions about
stomatal inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did one experiment where we put a
cone in the LICOR and then made an A-curve
[SPEAKER_00]: at different light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right after that, it went to an
ACA curve at different levels of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide with a constant relative humidity
and light level for the carbon dioxide so
[SPEAKER_00]: we could have one vapor pressure deficit
value to then make those comparisons on
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measured this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the control, the Civitas 1 and the
Civitas, three hours, one, two,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, and 10 days after we applied the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do is we get these big time
courses where we have three hours to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we replicated our runs twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll notice that for all these
treatments, there was never a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Civitas didn't affect respiration,
but it did affect the A-max levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then also means it affects the
quantum yield of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in run one, we had more suppression of
A-max than in run two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a factor of misapplication
and a little bit higher rate because the
[SPEAKER_00]: nozzle was too close to the canopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got a little bit higher rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it definitely showed that there's a
rate response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done some experiments to show
there is a linear rate response with A-max
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of just to summarize,
what this shows is we definitely have a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in radiation use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And respiration wasn't affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes 10 days at least for this
effect to start to wear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration from that same study,
again, we have photon flux density on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we had brighter light intensity,
we saw an increase in transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense from a mass balance
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Civitas had higher levels of,
or had lower levels, lower intercepts
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that there's less transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't as dramatic of a decline as
the light response measurements,
[SPEAKER_00]: the assimilation measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually recover within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 48 hours, you can see that the
transpiration rates had came back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of the control, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we looked at the ACA
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of looks at the kinetics of
rubisco activity and carboxylation
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial slope represents the
initial carboxylation efficiency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the y-intercepts represent the
respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice, first of all,
respiration rate was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit lower with the Civitas
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that results from an increase in
photorespiration, because these are all at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same light intensity of 400 or 500
micromoles of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this data kind of represents
indicates that there's reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxylation efficiency and increases for
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that when you have a decrease
in gas exchange, that activity of rubisco
[SPEAKER_00]: declines, because it takes a lot of energy
to keep rubisco in an active state,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if it's limited for its
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these curves suggest that the plants
are substrate carbon dioxide limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they have a decline in
rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we looked at gas
exchange, carbon simulation as a function
[SPEAKER_00]: of transpiration rate, which is a proxy
again for gas exchange and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find with the Civitas 1 that there
is a really strong increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis back to kind of level of
the control as we had higher transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests directly that some model
conductance is actually what's inhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: this carbon assimilation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Civitas itself is a little bit less,
which makes sense, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected back on the light response
assimilation curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to note, too, is after this
initial part where it's really linear or
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly linear, that occurred early after
we applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on after we applied the
Civitas, it came back to be less of a
[SPEAKER_00]: function of transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that suggests that it's an inability of
the plant to utilize all the carbon it's
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in from the, from transpiration,
from gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, suggesting that rubisco is probably
somehow inhibited through some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: inactivation later on into each run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions, Civitas definitely
reduced carbon radiation use efficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: and transpiration gas exchange for a
period of 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carboxylation efficiencies were
definitely reduced as a function of that
[SPEAKER_00]: decline in gas exchange measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads us to our final questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, now we know there are less
photosynthesis occurring, less
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening to the partitioning of
carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our question would be,
you know, was this reduction in gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange have effect on oxidative stress
in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final chapter of my dissertation,
we looked at Civitas altering carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics and we measured plant biomass
partitioning and then measured
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of storage carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This experiment was designed to simulate
stressful conditions, so it's under really
[SPEAKER_00]: high light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that partly was because we find that
as light intensity increases, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger disparity between the Civitas level
and the control for carbon assimilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way we kind of exacerbate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a worst-case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it led to some episodic
daily water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of could evaluate how Civitas
affects plant stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's marketed a lot that
is useful in helping plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reapplied Civitas and WiltStop,
a commercial anti-transparent bi-weekly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then measured carbon partitioning and
quality and gas exchange over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight weeks to get a sense of how
carbon partitioning is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we did confirm that the Civitas
and the WiltStop reduced carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation and transpiration by about,
you know, 10 to 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was measured two weeks after we
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's even lasting inhibition of
carbon assimilation two weeks after
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at it, there wasn't an
interaction with weeks after treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did find that in the first four
weeks, there's kind of a general increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in carbon assimilation and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is a function of the
plants adjusting to the new higher light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the episodic drought stress that
occurred started to really deteriorate
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at week six and at week eight,
there's a dramatic decline in carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation and transpiration right
through to that high stress environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did it change biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clipping yield was the only thing that was
significantly different in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civitas had higher clipping yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the time lapse would suggest that
it's actually a, that there is some growth
[SPEAKER_00]: component to that, but it could also be
the weight of the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And counter to that, though, WiltStop does
have weight itself, so then you'd also
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to see an increase in WiltStop,
and that didn't occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no change in the above-ground
biomass or the root mass, although there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a trend of decreased root mass with
Civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water contents were the same
across the three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also obvious, too, there's no
interaction between treatment and weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on week eight, we start to see that
there's a dramatic change in the mass of
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield, and especially the
root-to-shoot ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at week two, there's about
double the amount of verduras as there is
[SPEAKER_00]: to their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at week eight, there's nearly 70% the
amount of roots than there are
[SPEAKER_00]: above-ground tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that drought stress is definitely
changing how carbon's being partitioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a decline in water content as a
result of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does Civitas affect storage,
carbohydrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put Civitas down, it reduced the
starch in water-soluble fructans in the
[SPEAKER_00]: turfgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think of all water-soluble fructans
as turfgrass's currency, and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing any kind of practice that's reducing
the amount of sugars in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're potentially reducing the
plant's ability to recover from stress
[SPEAKER_00]: later on during the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, for the weeks after
treatment, the starch level has declined
[SPEAKER_00]: with drought stress, but we see an
increase in water-soluble carbohydrates as
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress continues on over the course of
eight weeks, which some of the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: would be consistent with the literature
and suggest that it's the plant then
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing for regrowth once that stress
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finally, we looked at soluble sugar
response to these episodic drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the main sugars that were
found in the above-ground biomass of our
[SPEAKER_00]: turfgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had fructose, glucose, and sucrose,
myonocytol, sorbitol, and triolose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no interaction with treatments
for myonocytol, so they were all pooled
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed some interesting trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, looking at two weeks to four weeks
after application, we noticed that the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments were all statistically the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that drought stress,
episodic stress really picked up,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we had a real divergence in the level
of soluble carbohydrates in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant uses soluble carbohydrates
for osmoregulation, and it also can use
[SPEAKER_00]: them for signaling a plant's stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we focus just on the eight-week
measurements, we notice that for fructose
[SPEAKER_00]: and glucose, we see an increase in those
sugars with the civitas compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: control and the wilt stop was in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for the sucrose, there wasn't an
increase between the civitas and the
[SPEAKER_00]: control plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control really had a dramatic
increase in sucrose, which the turfgrass
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and Kentucky Bluegrass suggest,
sucrose should increase during drought
[SPEAKER_00]: stress to help it with osmoregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then look at sorbitol and triolose,
some stress sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find, especially with the triolose,
that there was not a response to drought
[SPEAKER_00]: stress with the triolose content,
whereas the control did increase under
[SPEAKER_00]: that drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brings up some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really unclear currently,
and it's going to require a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation to understand how civitas
is actually affecting plant stress
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from this, there is potential that
maybe the civitas is actually hindering
[SPEAKER_00]: normal plant stress, drought stress
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the quality data,
which I didn't present, you would notice
[SPEAKER_00]: that the civitas probably handled the
drought stress worse than the wilt stop or
[SPEAKER_00]: the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some potential that this could
be a negative response that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not proceeding the drought with the
civitas application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of in conclusions, we see the
increased clipping yield in civitas at the
[SPEAKER_00]: expense of carbohydrate accumulation,
which has implications for stress
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to the beginning of the
study, that could relate to that decline
[SPEAKER_00]: in turfgrass stand density by the end of
2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see the obvious decline and did not
see an obvious improvement with turfgrass
[SPEAKER_00]: stress tolerance with civitas,
which is kind of contrary to what their
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing campaign would suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still unclear why soluble sugars
responded that the way they did,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will require some future
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of look full circle what's
happened, we've shown that civitas affects
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield and ball roll, which may
limit its application to putting green,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still has potential for fairways and
roughs and tee boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And athletic fields and other places that
want to reduce their pesticide usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this phytotoxicity that
results from this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely a chronic
phytotoxicity from stomatal inhibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: which reduced photosynthesis and
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carbon dynamics indicate that we
have a decrease in soluble or in storage
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates with the civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some future experimentation would be
looking to optimize the dose response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything I did here was a
worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go at less of a rate, we'll have less
of effect on physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then counter to that, will it have a
less of effect on that disease priming
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect that the product is used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measure oxidative stress of
inhibiting gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some difference in
photorespiration and photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should look at the formulation of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's a pretty wide,
they're all paraffins, but they range from
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 carbons to 33 carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, products that are less
phytotoxic, like the JMS stylet oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have really, really narrow ranges of
paraffin chain length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so potentially, maybe there are
components of civitas that are phytotoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not increasing the plant
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I saw a paper recently,
it got published a couple of weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that showed a 16 carbon alkane has been
found to prime and do systemic resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a lot of potential to be the
active ingredient of civitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we should look at that formulation
more closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm trying to understand
how civitas affects stress tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this product is being applied
during the stress of the summer season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should get a better sense of how
that is actually occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank a lot of people,
especially my committee, Frank and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Seder, Bergstrom, Mazurek,
and Marty Petrovic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank my research techs, Mary Thurn,
Brett Welch, and my undergrad,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan Gehry, and Angela Fever,
who tirelessly counted, did a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like ball roll measurements every
day and cleaning grass clippings and
[SPEAKER_00]: counting tillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Petro Canada,
because they funded my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Michael Pfeffer, who is a lead
scientist who developed the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very, very helpful to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Bill Miller for helping
with the carbohydrate analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rose Harmon for actually helping me do
the analysis twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank Liling Chang and Tom
Whitlow for letting me use their Lycor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Wild Hall plant care people,
especially Nick VanEck, who is always
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to thank my fiance,
Katie, because, aside from her helping me
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of lab analysis on weekends,
she's always very, very supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know Katie, and she's a sweet,
caring, compassionate person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all my friends that have helped
me survive these three and a half years at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, and helped me survive at the Big
Red Barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
