[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously we're going to talk a little
bit about berries today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do, and that's what I've
been doing at Cornell now for 17 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work in actually several different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see up here, raspberries,
strawberries, and blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell has a long history of work in
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The station opened in 1882, and berries
were one of the first fields that were
[SPEAKER_00]: planted that first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the station in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, at that time, the station was
an independent unit, was not part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, but did join Cornell in 1923,
and that program has been maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: through that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the oldest berry breeding program
in the United States, and as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously active, as far as I can tell,
we're the oldest continuously active
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the world, but those stats are
a little hard to come by, so there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: some dispute there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that time, our program has developed
41 different raspberry varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: three of which I have named and patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also developed 43 strawberry
varieties over that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 43rd one coming out today,
being announced today in the Chronicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did plan that a little bit,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so generally, and then there has been
some blackberry varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been little work in blackberries,
mainly because New York is generally too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold to consistently grow blackberries,
but that's changing with some new genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're using in blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my program and my appointment is
research and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very diverse set of clientele
that we work for, that we try to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the home gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening is the number one hobby in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, can be done by people of all
ages, and people continue to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our varieties are certainly many of
them are suitable for home gardeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they really love berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing better than a berry out of
your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the best tasting berry you'll
ever get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, you can't grow berries in your
backyard all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the people that cater to those
home gardeners, certainly the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are companies like Burpee Seed
Company sell our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gardens Alive Company, which is
Gurney's and Michigan Bulb Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of those other catalog companies
that sell berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can sell directly to the retail
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally small numbers, high price per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get into the commercial nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might recognize nurseries like Norse
Farms, Cron Farms in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of berry nurseries around
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work directly with them, with our
varieties, licensing our varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also working with them with new
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They propagate some of our material to
give out to growers for grower trials
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very good relationship with
many of these growers around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then commercial producers,
both domestic and international.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work directly with the New York State
Berry Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide member growers who will test
some of our material before it make it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace, as well as larger
companies in California that want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: things pre-commercialization so they can
be ahead of the game when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have international cooperation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have exclusive contracts in Mexico,
in Europe, and we're working on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries so that they can see our
material very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something they like,
they can bring it to the market before
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else, and they can have it for
their own programs, for their own
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the extension side of things,
we do things like variety trials generally
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of production technology
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work quite a bit with Marvin,
of course, on that, Marvin Pritz on that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a project that Marvin led on low
tunnels for strawberries with day neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: to extend the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very, very successful and the
berries look really good under the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really, we think it's a very good
option for the New York grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now there are strawberries
available underneath these low tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are still picking strawberries
where they have them, and they can pick
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries through, generally through
the mid-November is how we find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we just run out of berries as it
cools down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the quality and the season extension
is really great using some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we started using high tunnels
at the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, we put up our first set of about
a half an acre of, these are Haygrove high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're multi-bay,
they're interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are seasonal, so the plastic comes
off in the wintertime and goes back up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: For raspberries, this step in production
technology has really changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raspberry industry, all it does is
keep the rain off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a raspberry that gets rained on in the
field has a shelf life of about two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four days by truck to get from
California to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they get rained on, even though it
doesn't rain a lot in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does rain sometimes, although in the
last few years, not very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fruit are unsellable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them under tunnels where they don't
get wet, you get a shelf life of 10 to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there aren't very many technology you
can use to get a five to 600% increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: your shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important for raspberries
because they're so perishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also find the plants grow better,
the fruit's bigger, and the yields are
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the commercial market, for the
supermarket in California, all raspberries
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown under high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no open field production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they can guarantee the quality
and they can provide a consistent product
[SPEAKER_00]: that we expect to see in the supermarkets
every day now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't always work out the way you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Hurricane Ike in 2008,
about a day and a half after we finished
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the plastic on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came right over the top of us,
70 mile an hour winds, and tore it up
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, we had it rebuilt,
put back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked really bad that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disassembled it, parts that were bent,
straightened some of them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced some of them, and we were back in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really did look bad Monday morning,
though, coming to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty disheartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hold field days then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the variety trials, we have all
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well bring people in to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put, you can see, we put all this
fruit out so that people can sample it,
[SPEAKER_00]: see the difference between the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers come in, they see how we're
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way to get direct outreach and
to get direct input from the growers on
[SPEAKER_00]: what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the you came early,
you saw in the back, I put out some
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw there was a little score sheet,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd have a captive audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well get some information out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the type of thing we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll provide grower samples, let them
taste them, let them rate them on what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think about raspberries or
strawberries, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out people don't all like the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the good tasting varieties do
separate out that most people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's often the outliers,
people who like tart berries, the really
[SPEAKER_00]: sour ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fairly common in raspberries to
have acidic fruit that is tart in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, the market has moved
towards sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher sugar, bigger, and redder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, Colin was able to bring some
fruit down in Geneva and they got some to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put any score sheets out for him,
but I didn't want to leave you out for
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not seeing it, it should be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Colin didn't bring it, then I'll
talk to him later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin is my technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's how I get anything done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about the statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies since I've been at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came to Cornell, the strawberry
industry in the United States as a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: was about a $1 billion industry on about
46,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of those acreages are in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part has not changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's about 59,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2015 data.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 of those acres are in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 19,000 acres are spread across
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half of that in Florida and the rest
spread out around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is fifth in production in acreage
in strawberry production in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is a very small fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: $2.2 billion in the US in farm gate value.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1.8 billion of that comes out of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you an idea of the scope of the
industry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a year-round industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are producing strawberries pretty
much somewhere in California, pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: year-round now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries is really where we've seen the
real dramatic changes since I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1999, the process industry has
stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much Washington,
a little bit in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value has gone up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see $104 million in 2015 on a
slightly fewer acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a machine-harvested industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For frozen primarily, it's very
concentrated on three or four varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer produced in the summer with a very
specific training system for the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we see the real advances in the
fresh market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1999, California had about 1,800 acres
of raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, it was up to 8,800 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fresh market raspberries, the USDA
only takes statistics on California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells you what the rest of the
country doesn't even register in their
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value has risen from $31 million in
1999 to almost $500 million worth out of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just California.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about where raspberries and
strawberries are grown, we have Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: just to the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tremendous amount of fruit that
comes from there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as New York, the industry has been
flat for the pretty much the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 99, we had about 1,600 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, they only registered 960 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the region, that is the top states
that produce the varieties that we produce
[SPEAKER_00]: here, that cold climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 6,800 acres in 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now only about 3,800 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the statistics that they
collect, those are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value stayed pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, raspberries, we have seen a
five-fold increase in acreage and a
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-fold increase in value in fresh red
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is specifically fresh red raspberries
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to any supermarket pretty much any
day of the year, you'll see raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driscoll's is the biggest name in
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have driven that industry
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's increased berry production in
Mexico as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of blackberries are
coming out of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a particular variety that works
very well, can be manipulated to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit most of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, labor is very affordable there,
and they can ship the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold very well, and they're shipping
them into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the U.S., blackberry production has
not increased nearly as much as the other
[SPEAKER_00]: berries, although we're starting to see
that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that's changed for New York is
the locally grown movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, there was only about 230 farmers
markets only, I say, in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's over 500, and that trend
continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationwide, that trend continues as well,
over 7,800 farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to farmers markets in this area,
there's almost always berries locally
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those acreages are rarely caught in
the statistics because they're very small
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very small acreages, a half acre,
a quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter acre of raspberries can be a lot
of raspberries to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes they don't even make it
into the statistics because when those
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets come out that they have to fill out
and they're growing 14 different crops
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've got green beans,
and they've got pumpkins, and they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet corn, and they've got everything
else they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berries don't even register on their
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know people are growing berries in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our beginning berry growing workshops that
we hold are packed with people excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it on a very small scale and
still produce enough berries to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: money, to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just one crop within many
crops that many of these farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these small grower statistics,
they're really difficult to capture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA's overall statistic picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's changed then with
these farmers markets and the locally
[SPEAKER_00]: grown movement is that people are more
interested in distinctive varieties for
[SPEAKER_00]: these markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supermarket has gone towards one
thing, big and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they want, big red
raspberries, big red strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much where the
marketplace is when you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they look great in the
container, but sometimes the eating
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is not where you'd really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a farmer's market,
you want a high quality berry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want a high quality and a high flavor
berry, and you don't want what you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want a big red raspberry that doesn't
taste very good, I can go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people go to farmer's markets,
sometimes they want something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my program, and of course we still
want to produce a big red raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: because our California collaborators,
they still want those for the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a variety we put out a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big and red, flavors adequate,
ships very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to balance what you're trying
to do with the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with strawberries, this is
Archer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't, you'll see some pictures
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large red berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one happens to be very high flavor as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little softer than what you'll find
in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping for the local market,
people will enjoy this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fills containers really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like that, both for you pick
and for pre-picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have some darker berries that
we've put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you'll see on my right is Purple
Wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being sold through Burpee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much darker than an average
strawberry would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that color carries all the way through
the flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a dark flesh berry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The juice comes out of it looking like
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the commercial market really doesn't
know what to do with something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fit into any of their marketing
schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see Burpee has a nice display on
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'll notice over here, they're
selling them for $10.95 a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grower buys strawberry
plants for about 13 to 15 cents a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you an idea of what the retail
market will bear when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no part in deciding what the cost of
these would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burpee did that on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get a very small portion of that as
royalties back to the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courtney, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why can that not be?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are regulations on shipping plants
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: California certainly has a lot of
regulations on you can't ship certain
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about all of these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are not states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be some territories involved
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be they don't want to ship some
of these places as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly California you have to
inspect plants, for instance, for Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles before you can ship plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be my guess there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a white strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see in the catalogs listed as pine
berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flesh, red seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes like a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just a novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really not something for the commercial
market, for the retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits something that people like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they like to tinker in their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to pick stuff and show their
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very popular in that kind of
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's a very small portion of
what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the darker raspberries,
crimson night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one I put over on the table
with the refreshments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark fruited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freezes very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much darker than what you see in the
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a peach colored one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still on the soft side if you had some
back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't ship particularly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it eats well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your backyard it's very interesting
to look at as well as eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work a little bit in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily we're working in purple because
we're trying to transfer traits from red
[SPEAKER_00]: into black.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cross a black raspberry and a red
raspberry, the fruit's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to transfer thornless,
which we have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to transfer fall bearing
as well, which is in the middle stages for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the stuff we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to get a purple that was
interesting, there is some market for it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lesser interest in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much a novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it look interesting when you have a
fruit salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they pretty much taste like red
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people will choose red when you
give.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to put out a yellow one just
to have a complete suite of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not one we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you'll find on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh, I want blue raspberry
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a real flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are not the kind of berries we're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really wish that blue raspberry
flavor would go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is something I actually do get
asked about fairly often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding program today is
traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cross breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transfer pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very straightforward process that's
been going on for centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work in strawberry, both short day,
which are the June bears that we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day neutral, more interest that
will provide that season extension in
[SPEAKER_00]: those low tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry, both black and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the flora cane is for summer
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start somewhere in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll produce through most of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primate cane starting in July and
produce into the fall through June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until it gets too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: With blackberry, I mentioned traditional
blackberries fruit in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do well in New York because
they generally freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canes freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get a reliable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John Clark at University of Arkansas
started this a number of years ago to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with blackberries that would fruit in the
fall so you can avoid winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing some work with him
and now on our own to bring that flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time early enough into the season so that
we can flower in July and August and have
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: September, October for blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blackberries I brought back there
today were picked yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the new selections from the
program are in full harvest and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a very nice product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield is still a little bit on the low
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some yield is better than no yield,
which is what we generally get with summer
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect to see more blackberry
production in the northern climates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're starting to adapt these types
of varieties in California as well for
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can time the plantings to get
fruit at a certain number of days after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting on the current year's growth
without a dormancy period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very faint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the molecular genetic projects is
the other side of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get asked a lot about how long does
it take to get a variety out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd walk you through what we
did with Archer, my newest strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Archer was a selection I made very
early in my career here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was done very much in the
traditional sense of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see every step was done
through the field on a year by year basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a long time doing it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some strategies we've worked
on and I'll talk about how we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: speeding that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how Archer started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 99 we made some crosses,
made some hybridizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a lot of information to go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't worked on berries for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had the records from the past
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made some crosses, collected the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000 that seed got treated and got
planted out into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just grow them in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted them in rows and let them
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have to grow a year, go through
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next spring we get to see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've cleaned that up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on plastic to help with weed
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the process is generally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in the ground one spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next spring we get to see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a little bit of raised beds when
you get a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last year we had water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so high it went almost over the
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from some years we get a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some years you get none.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't know that in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2001 we made the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 2001 selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some notes that day when I selected
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge kingberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the primary berry that comes off a
strawberry in the industry they'll call it
[SPEAKER_00]: the kingberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put very large Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I use the term queenberry as well
rather than secondary because it's easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not generally used in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote that it was firm, good
interior color, good flavor, tart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some notes that day and I picked
three fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A primary berry, a secondary berry,
and a tertiary berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add those up it's almost 100 grams of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I calculated if you took 100 grams of
fruit which is only three berries per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on a per acre basis that's over
4,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant produces more than three fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of thing when we see
this kind of thing we're like wow we got
[SPEAKER_00]: yield right away because we got a lot of
fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes off very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes off at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us to have a tertiary berry in the
16 gram size is a very good berry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 will get you about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 grams will be about the size of a plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's larger than what you normally see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pick berries down to about 8 to 10
grams is acceptable for a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that year we had one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there is is one plant from that
one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever runners it produced we
collected those runners, rooted them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a picture from that first
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the prettiest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there holding them with one hand
taking a picture with the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not I'm not a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me it gets it in my head so I can
look back and say oh I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we do to have a picture of
kind of a record as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start a plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a year to make the runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you plant them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait another year before they
fruit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted and then we look at it for two
or three years because we want to see is
[SPEAKER_00]: it going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to have some disease that
wipes it out in the first second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the fruit going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to produce runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect more runners from the next
plot and then you plant another plot and
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it again to make sure because you
got to plant it in different locations to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you didn't plant it in the best
possible location and it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a bad location it's going to die
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted multiple plots in different
locations so that we can see this over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to evaluate it for
several years to see how it comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they persist in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it have a good yield every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time to go through this and it
can really take a long time and during
[SPEAKER_00]: that way most of the selections get
sloughed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found wanting for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're susceptible to some disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce enough runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit quality declines over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're planting the
same plant every time and that when you it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces fruit the fruit looks like what
we think it's supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each time each cycle you're taking
pictures to make sure everything is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point we decided these are looking
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move it into tissue culture
because to take it off the station we need
[SPEAKER_00]: disease free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't collect stuff from the field and
send it out to growers or to a nursery and
[SPEAKER_00]: it could have any kind of pathogen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we move it into tissue culture to clean
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it doesn't have any viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it doesn't have phytophthora
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can take a few months but it can
take a year or more too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties don't tissue culture well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to check them for virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to produce more plants so we can
put them back out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure tissue culture didn't screw it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you put things in tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you get out of tissue culture doesn't
look like what you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to make sure that we grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're true to type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they look like what you expect
them to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, of course, take more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure it looks like it's
supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure you have the same
product that you, in the end, of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we confirm trueness of type.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that stage we're like, okay,
we got virus free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send it to the nursery so they can
propagate it in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can get it to some of the
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014 we sent out 16,000 plus plants
to 11 growers across the state so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could grow it in a large scale and give me
some feedback on how it looks for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it look in a commercial setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to that point we had 25 foot plots at
the biggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they get 1,000 plants or 2,000
plants and you can see it on an eighth of
[SPEAKER_00]: an acre or a quarter of an acre and
actually see it in a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evaluate it the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evaluate it again the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the growers will grow it in a
perennial setting and they want to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this takes 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to this point and we're finally,
okay, it's time to release it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being released today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being announced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is available to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they won't plant it until next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, of course, we're taking pictures all
along to make sure that it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send that out to the growers,
are they paying for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the growers will pay, what the
growers will do or what the nursery will
[SPEAKER_00]: charge is a propagation fee so that the
cost of propagation is offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not the same price that is,
we're not selling the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're offsetting the cost of
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's semantics, but it is not available to
commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was only available to
growers of the New York State Berry
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Association through a cooperative
agreement with Cornell University that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with the association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't send it to just any growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent it to growers who were part of
this organization that we had a contract
[SPEAKER_00]: with for doing the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fruit I got from a commercial
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved forward so that it's now going to
be available and they will plant the first
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial crop this coming spring in
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we won't see that fruit until
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, there's time every time you
have to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can really take a long time to get
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we speed up the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, protected agriculture is one of
those ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the high and low tunnels speed
things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a better look at the plants
because every year you have a good year
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can control the environment
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year in our open field, the
raspberries are very, very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're not irrigated, they just
didn't grow much because they didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: any rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tunnels where it's irrigated and
protected, the plants look just like they
[SPEAKER_00]: do every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eight feet tall and they're
covered in fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can really get a faster look at
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we can look at them quickly,
we can evaluate them quickly and move
[SPEAKER_00]: things into the commercial stream much
faster because we can make decisions based
[SPEAKER_00]: on better information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make that decision quickly and get
them into tissue culture quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have them in tissue culture,
there are commercial labs we work with who
[SPEAKER_00]: can propagate them and propagate thousands
of plants very quickly from a few tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both raspberry and strawberry work very
well in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so propagation, once you have the
culture started, goes very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in raspberry, it is commonly done in
the commercial nurseries that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: use tissue culture for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we've done is sped up the
grower valuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than waiting until that last stage
to get up to growers, we're really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it to the growers much sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year in New York, we sent some
2012 selections to a couple of growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: really preliminary trials, but to get a
commercial look at them much earlier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process, only four years from when it
was selected versus 10 or 12 years after
[SPEAKER_00]: it was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our commercial growers,
our larger growers, so we do that with the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State Berry Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our other cooperators in larger
locations, larger industry locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want new stuff as fast as they can
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes one or two years after it's
selected, they'll take a look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're really interested in
moving very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the infrastructure to give
me feedback very, very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the things we're
doing to try and speed things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term, we'd like to do some
marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using genetics and DNA technology to speed
up the process and make it more efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out the stuff that isn't worthy
before it ever makes it to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're a long ways from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we're doing in the
tunnel is growing things in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the field, when we plant a seedling,
it usually has to grow at least 18 months
[SPEAKER_00]: before we can see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summer types need to grow for two
years before we can see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fall types in a high tunnel in pots,
we can plant them in the ground greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: in March, bring them out in the pots in
May into the tunnels, and they're fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between March and now, we get to see
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can eliminate a lot of stuff that
is unsuitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can't make great decisions on the
stuff that looks best, but we can move it
[SPEAKER_00]: much faster and eliminate a lot of the
stuff that we're not interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the things that
we're starting to do more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a high tunnel like this,
it's 24 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fit about 900 potted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can go through 900 plants a year
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those in the field, those might be in
the field for three or four years for each
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditional breeding, which we were
doing before in the molecular genetic side
[SPEAKER_00]: of things, we've done quite a bit of
genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some marker assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some RNA seek work and genome
sequencing to try and increase the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of information that we have for the
genetics of raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the future, we'd like to try the
latest thing that everybody wants to try
[SPEAKER_00]: is CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think there's some really
interesting things that could be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: colonally propagated crops with this
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since raspberry works so well in
tissue culture, it's a fairly natural
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to try it on because it is usually
done in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some genetic mapping in
raspberry, primarily for phytopther root
[SPEAKER_00]: rot resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phytopther is a disease of the soil,
of the roots that's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty devastating on raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is good resistance, but most of the
resistance are in varieties that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly useful for the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to do breeding and you can do
breeding and you can do field of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it doesn't rain, you don't get
phytopthera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to screen stuff in the field
for phytopthera resistance if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry climate or if you have a dry year like
we did this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lots of problems on raspberries
this year, but phytopthera was not one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we didn't have a lot of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you look at phytopthera then in
a way that is consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we developed a hydroponic system so
we could actually observe the roots in the
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry as the disease is developing so
that we could get an accurate screen of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we develop molecular markers,
get a genetic map, and then look for QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, the quantitative trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phytopthera resistance in raspberry is
a multi-gene trait, a quantitative trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you look for QTLs to try to figure out
where in the genome most of the influence
[SPEAKER_00]: on that trait is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when there is no pathogen,
raspberry likes it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root systems are white and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you introduce the pathogen,
very quickly apparent which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible and which ones are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us an accurate screen to use
for our genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to use this,
and you'll see, multiple times in
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work was done by one of my
graduate students, Jeremy Patterson,
[SPEAKER_00]: who now works for Driscoll Strawberry
Associates in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see the genetic map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haploid number in raspberry is seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seven linkage groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the disease in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a qualitative score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it diseased or not diseased?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at stem lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they develop stem lesions as the plant
is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can measure how big those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the petioles get lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do a percentage of the petioles
that get lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take a root score as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we can observe the roots directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do a potted study and the roots
are surrounded by soil, you get dead or
[SPEAKER_00]: not dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very hard to tell what's going on
in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this way we are able to look at the
roots directly and get a score there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that all four of those traits
map to two regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tells us that when we're measuring
these things, all of them were a good
[SPEAKER_00]: measure of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they were measuring essentially
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same level of disease development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the percentage of the variation
that was explained by the various scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them, quite a bit, when you
combine the two locations, 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation was defined by that score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 25% with a stem lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't as consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see 55 and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these regions of the genome very
clearly have something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is when you start looking at
the sequence, that's a very large amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's quite a few genes in that
region that you would have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published some of this work in TAG some
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was later confirmed by another group in
Scotland that they published a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar work that came up with the same
conclusions, which we were very gratified
[SPEAKER_00]: to see since they're competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done some marker-assisted
selection with those markers in those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screened varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put varieties in there and introduced
it and looked at both the markers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance rating from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did the markers, about 76%
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that when the
resistance came from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: background, the markers kind of broke
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the background, the markers we found
followed a resistance from a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other sources in the
germplasm that are probably not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same area or at least have different
markers if they are in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at populations,
so seedling populations, it was all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the seedling populations that
were of the same source, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the populations that came from
sources of resistance that we didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that were not from the resistant lathum,
some of them were worse than flipping a
[SPEAKER_00]: coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the markers didn't always work across
the populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things we find very
commonly in marker-assisted selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're very population-specific,
the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find better markers that would
be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to do marker work,
or we continue to look at other
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, or we could try to use some
other genomic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the marker-assisted selection work,
we've presented some of this work at
[SPEAKER_00]: international conferences and published
that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to look a little deeper into
the question of what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What genes are turned on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is resistance happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at, we wanted to use RNA-seq,
or RNA-sequence-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-seq is a way to capture the RNA at a
specific time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't really, you're not following
it at, over time, but you grab the RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: from a tissue and isolate it, and that
tells you what's going on at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, we grabbed it at
another moment as well and compared the
[SPEAKER_00]: two moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you break them up into small pieces,
because at the time the technology was,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were at 86 base pairs, or nucleotides
was what could be sequenced using
[SPEAKER_00]: Illumina, turn it into DNA, sequence it,
and then you have millions of little
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments, and they have to be all pieced
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's quite a few computer programs
that they do this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps if you have a genome,
a reference genome that's already there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can reference those sequences
straight to the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't, you can put it together
just like a jigsaw puzzle where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the picture, and you're just trying
to piece it together bit by bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it's done with computers to
look at every possible combination to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what lines up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more accurate when you have a
genome, but sometimes you don't have that,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with crops like raspberry,
where there is no genome published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a widely studied genome or plant,
so there really isn't quite the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have for Arabidopsis,
or rice, or corn, or one of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: studied crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did both with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so again, we took the hydroponic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected RNA from the roots,
which is very difficult to do when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a pot covered with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hydroponic system came back into
it so we could collect fresh root tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then disease root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see the difference between
the susceptible ones and the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: ones at the RNA level, at the gene
expression level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reported on this at PAG and a few
other, and the Rubus-Ribe Symposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 71 million reads of 86
nucleotides, which is a fairly typical
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, once we looked at all the,
we identified approximately 17,000 genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that were expressed in these tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all kinds of genes are
expressed, and they may or may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: related to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took between the two groups,
between Titan and Latham, and there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of overlap, about 13,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did an alignment both to
diploid, sorry, diploid strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was pretty much the closest genome
that we had as a reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did de novo as well,
just the one without a pitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you just try and piece it together
based on the sequence you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done by another graduate
student, Jud Ward, also works for Driscoll
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Associate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the head of their genome department
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a differential expression
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the genes between the two groups
to see what was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assembly was done, how to do it in
non-model plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published that in the Journal of
Botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very well received because
there's a lot of crops that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: very little genome data to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a reference genome when
it's like, well, how do we deal with all
[SPEAKER_00]: this RNA-seq data?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we put that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much in both of them,
you infect them with phytophthora,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all their defense genes turn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they have goes nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some differential expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these things were turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't get into the details of what the
genes are, but these have to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting the pathogen and turning on the
defense mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw differential expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Titan, they weren't turned on as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a susceptible one as they were in
Latham.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upregulation of very key defensive
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PR genes are pathogenesis-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are genes that are often turned on
and expressed when a plant is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight off a pathogen of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found 18 different ones that were
expressed in Latham.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 of them were upregulated in Latham,
where only 10 were upregulated in Titan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and three of them were actually
downregulated in Titan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different expression pattern of these
defense-responsive genes between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: types, between the resistant and the
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, these are large numbers of
genes that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a BLAST search of the data just
using the terms salicylic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: jasmonic acid, systemic acquired
resistance, defense disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all terms that are used to
describe genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we did that, 99 different
things came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99's a lot of things to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of stuff you get from
BLAST.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could tell, though, these were genes
that were actually differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the resistant type,
so in Latham.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the control versus the treatment,
you can see the number goes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's expressed more highly in the
resistant, or when the pathogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here, then, these are just the
search terms that you use and what pops up
[SPEAKER_00]: from the BLAST searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this table went on for page after page
after page, because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to sort through all this,
figure out what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you go with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 99's better than 17,000,
but we still can't actually do candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene work on 99 different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not possible with the funding I
have and the technology that we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take a long time and a big team
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things you can rule out
fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very specific responses versus
very broad responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are about producing lignin
in the cells, and that may not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: direct response, but is kind of a side
response to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start to rule some of that stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want to align it to the
genome, to the QTLs that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can start looking just in the
region where the QTLs are, rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: looking through all the genome,
and focus on those first, the genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be present in those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at the stage where we're at
now, analyzing the genome data that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with the RNA-seq data to try and
narrow down our choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we start figuring out what
might be there, that's where the CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: would come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, CRISPR is something, though,
that right now, a lot of people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of experience with, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think there's some targets in
Raspberry that we can use to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: use a technique and make it possible,
useful in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with CRISPR,
it's a bacterial system that they theorize
[SPEAKER_00]: is used in protecting the bacteria from
viral infection, primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what the acronym
stands for, they're Clustered Regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: Interspace Short Palindromic Repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tells you a lot, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are specific DNA sequences in the
bacterial genome that the bacteria can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to target alongside this CRISPR-associated
protein 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: It forms a complex, and it can find the
foreign DNA in its own genome and
[SPEAKER_00]: systematically or very specifically cut it
out and get rid of the pathogenic DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what scientists think that the
actual system does in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they've done is harmonize this to
take this section here, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted DNA, and put in one that you want
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make this DNA molecule yourself so that
you can target a very specific DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence that you want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, though, you have to know the
very specific DNA sequence that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to change, and it's a very small piece of
DNA that you want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really very challenging to get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new student, Archana, is working on
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some of this work with
Thornless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think a simple trait that we can very
easily visually work with and classify is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're going to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a population that's segregating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do some sequencing to try and find
the gene for Thornless, and then try to
[SPEAKER_00]: use CRISPR to work on the Thornless gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do this in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can very rapidly phenotype them as the
process goes forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're at the end of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, then, we want to transfer that
to phytophthora work as we narrow down the
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes that could possibly be
interested in phytophthora resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I mentioned a couple of my
former students, both working for
[SPEAKER_00]: Driscoll's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Boone was a technician in my program
for many years, and Colin is my current
[SPEAKER_00]: technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without him, I don't have a chance to get
a whole lot done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, Archana will be working
with me for the next several years on this
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited to see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in a nutshell, there's the berry
breeding at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any questions, I will be
around for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question about me not mentioning
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic is a very challenging thing for
berries, because they're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very perishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of things that like to eat
them, besides humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orch is even more difficult because of
all the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, without these fungicides, it's very
challenging to get organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new pest called spondyploid
versafolo, which is a little fruit fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: is causing even more trouble with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most organic production right now is grown
in dry climate locations, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using organic pesticides to try to control
that fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only approach we have right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrition is very difficult as well in
these tunnel systems with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, because they don't work well
in the vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't do a lot of organic raspberry
or strawberry production in the orch,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of the challenges of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious if you looked at the
nutritional profiles or any phytochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles of the different raspberry
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was about looking at
phytochemical and nutritional differences
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done a fair bit of work in that
area, both here and in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: North Carolina State, where they have a
lab that does a lot of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find wide ranges of certainly advanced
phenolic content amongst the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all very high, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the yellow ones are very high in
phenolic compounds, even though they have
[SPEAKER_00]: no pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're high in vitamin A, folic acid,
vitamin C, a host of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, berries are good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to eat more of them,
not necessarily specific ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of published work on the
differences amongst the
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kept you there long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your RNA seed work, how did you choose
a time point to analyze?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, a time point after an ovulation
to collect your samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would there be any better time material
for you to do this again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you all heard the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our studies before, in doing the
analysis of inheritance, we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: observe the root systems as the pathogen
was introduced and the disease progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used our experience from that to choose
a time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, we did zero time point
before the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually took samples at two
days, six days, and 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were very distinct time points
in the inheritance study.
[SPEAKER_00]: At two days, there was no symptoms yet,
but there was infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could measure that there was
infection in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At six days, you start seeing symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 30 days, you start seeing grow back
of the roots that are in the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have that last time point,
the susceptible ones, because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: all dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were able to then choose those
points so that we could see the
[SPEAKER_00]: progression of the disease, not only in
the plant, but in the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as a better tissue, it seems that
for phytophthora, that the resistance is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the root system, is expressed in the
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the best tissue to use,
though it is somewhat challenging to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we want to stay with the
varieties that we've been using,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have so much historical data on
those varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, there are other sources of
resistance that we would like to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can only use so much, because we
know there are sources that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: related to this source that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, we don't have plans to
use other genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our time is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Professor Weber for a
fascinating presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
