[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the detailed instruction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I need to say that thank you
for attending.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to have you as an audience and
I'm excited to present my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: My work is about glyphosate and I'm
looking at glyphosate interaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: organ and immune association and focusing
on kinetics and mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we know about herbicide
application in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate is most heavily applied between
all those herbicides to kill bits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years, it became more popular and
the farmer loves this herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at this map here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Mississippi River.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Mississippi Basin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Central Valley, Columbia River,
and Washington State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are plains which heavily farmed and
heavily used for herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbicide, or you can know as this
trademark, Roundup, became a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: controversial in terms of environmental
toxicity and polymers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can find herbivore in soil,
water, even air, and also it can be
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulated in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's defined by EPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of usage, that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are thinking we should pay attention
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing here the main processes of
glyphosate in environmental complements,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it moves around, after spray,
it can be by accumulating plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it can be generated by UV lights,
or it can enter into water, sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: into soil or water, and interacts with
minerals, specifically organ and immune
[SPEAKER_02]: associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested to learn about how it
retains and be released, or transforms,
[SPEAKER_02]: and those are mineral and organ immune
association, abiotically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's really important to know how
these bioproducts can be generated after
[SPEAKER_02]: transformation, because we see ANPA,
omnivorous phosphoric acid, which is one
[SPEAKER_02]: of those bioproducts, this can be uptaken
by plant much more than glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's has the same toxicity impact on
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a general understanding,
a general figure of my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organ immune association concentration
diminishes as we go down the profile,
[SPEAKER_02]: and after spray, obviously it's going to
interact with organ immune association on
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of interaction and type of organ
immune association, it can go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: retention process, or it can be
transformed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manganese oxide is very well known for
transformation or oxidation of glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is a candidate for doing that
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iron oxide selectively absorbs organics
and forms organ immune association,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's a good representative to take as
organ immune association to seek
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate retention at one.
[SPEAKER_02]: In act one, or section one, there's a kind
of into section for my dissertation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's about the stability of
particles in soil, organ immune
[SPEAKER_02]: association forms, and obviously can
change the stability of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the other language, they call them,
how can it be more hydrophobic or
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrophilic?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can measure it, it's measuring water
contact angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the contact angle is about 90 degree,
it's going to be more hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and below that is hydrophilic surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So agotite is a hydrophilic surface,
and I picked diamond because we have
[SPEAKER_02]: diamond plate, and that's a hydrophobic
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be used as a model to study how
organ immune association formation can
[SPEAKER_02]: change this hydrophobic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for organic or dissolving matter,
I picked polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polysaccharide can be found in soil,
and it comes from plant cell wall,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also microbial micro mass,
and they accumulate at the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals, specifically on metal oxides.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I have a model system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that more fundamentally,
instead of using like the extraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: DORM.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this graph here, first of all,
I use in C2ATR spectroscopy is a technique
[SPEAKER_02]: to see absorption at the surface of a
mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have mineral, you can introduce
your organic, your target sorbent,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can absorb, and you're gonna see some
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come different frequency,
and those frequency is related to
[SPEAKER_02]: different bondings in each molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the surface of the oxide, we see
absorption of polysaccharide is much more
[SPEAKER_02]: than diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because polysaccharide itself is
hydrophilic, and hydrophilic loves
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of kinetic, with increasing
surface loading or polysaccharide,
[SPEAKER_02]: we notice it's getting slower,
and we have more adsorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And subsequently, when we have desorption
phase, some of those adsorbed can be
[SPEAKER_02]: desorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's much, we have more adsorption,
there's more chance for desorption,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in lower adsorption rate, we have less
desorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other way to translate that,
looking at isotherm, adsorption,
[SPEAKER_02]: desorption, isotherm also shows this
loading at different state, like a phase
[SPEAKER_02]: adsorption and desorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a similar set, data set for
diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have less adsorption compared to
both sides, kinetically much, much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during desorption, I can say most of
them are desorbed, and some of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: still at surface, and this is,
you can see, an isotherm, as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really important to know,
first, how much stuff you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: how does it look like, the loading,
rate, and capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did next, I was interested to see
the hydrophobicity and felicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used water contact angle measurement
meter to measure the water contact angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: When increasing surface loading here,
we notice on both surfaces, hydrophobicity
[SPEAKER_02]: increases since we have higher contact
angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting, but it doesn't
matter what surface you start,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you load more, more, more,
surface became more hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this picture here, it's not obvious,
actually, I'll leave that screen so much
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The outline here, this space, is loaded by
polycyclic right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a TA image of polycyclic north,
like association.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's giving you a visual result,
how does it look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: In summary, and also more data we have
here, in terms of functional, interaction
[SPEAKER_02]: of functionality on polycyclic private
surface, what we learned in the interface
[SPEAKER_02]: of sequence for those functional groups,
you can see functional groups here,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is polycyclic right structure,
carboxylic groups, MI groups, ambitously
[SPEAKER_02]: groups, and this is backbone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the surface of diamond,
the hydrophobic surface, backbone,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a more hydrophobic surface,
hydrophobic component, it starts to show
[SPEAKER_02]: up at surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: But loading more and more, we started to
see MI in carboxylic, functionalities,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are more hydrophilic, and,
but at the end, it's wrapped up by a metal
[SPEAKER_02]: ester functional group, which is
hydrophobic, more hydrophobic than other
[SPEAKER_02]: functionalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same, we have the same trend,
like in terms of how this hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrophilic functionalities accumulate at
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And load type, at the end of the loading,
ultimate loading, we saw again metal
[SPEAKER_02]: ester, and the surface again became
hydrophobic, at the top here, at the most
[SPEAKER_02]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very important to know how much
organic matter can change the
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity,
and how this gonna impact the transfer of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants when they gonna interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Act two.
[SPEAKER_02]: In act two, so I introduced glyphosate in
the system, and I found, that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: question, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was how this organic
crystallization now can change glyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: retention, or if there's any potential for
release with the azure or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a batch study that I'm showing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, look at this plot at the left side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within this red line, showing adsorption
of glyphosate, with increasing adsorb
[SPEAKER_02]: loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found with loading more polysaccharide,
adsorb less, glyphosate adsorb less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after, when we had desorption,
this is the blue line, we had some
[SPEAKER_02]: desorbed, but the same trend, the same
trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look after specific points,
with loading more polysaccharide here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and here for adsorption and desorption,
we had a little bit increase for
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate adsorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more favorable, it looks to have more
glyphosate, even we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharide at the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did, I said maybe it's about a
charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look at the charge of the surface,
because electrostatically we are
[SPEAKER_02]: attracting each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I measured the potential of those samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found with increasing this red,
sorry, this green line here, with
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing loading, we are generating more
negative charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate itself is nitrogen ion,
but in total, one is a negative one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means we should have less
adsorption, and that's, which is about
[SPEAKER_02]: this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about this part?
[SPEAKER_02]: When we have more loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we have more loading, it looks,
when we have, I mean, we add glyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: in, this is the red dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the potential became a little bit
more positive, still negative,
[SPEAKER_02]: but less, in terms of the positive force,
it's less repulsive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can have more interaction,
attractive interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fundamentally, I have one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what do we see this increase for
charge?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked, I looked at it in detail,
using STD NMR technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: STD NMR technique is a very good technique
to study cost gas complexation between
[SPEAKER_02]: protein and small ligands.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the combination of glyphosate and
polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to come, we had to sample,
this is just glyphosate only.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found, when we have take of glyphosate
in this sample, when we have a STD NMR
[SPEAKER_02]: spectra, that actually shows we have
non-covalent interaction via hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: bonding between polysaccharides and
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can interact with each other through
hydrogen bonding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hydrogen bonding is a very good sort
of interaction to stabilize the complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the complex can immobilize easily at
the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this increase now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a batch study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to see more about glyphosate
itself and its bonding, how the molecule
[SPEAKER_02]: interact at the surface and how do we see
those functionalities in glyphosate?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have glyphosate here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has phosphonate group, amine group,
and carboxylic acid group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see how it's interacting at the
surface of polysaccharide, polysaccharide,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the right-hand side, you are looking
at PO band, which is related to this
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction, can be sorption of
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the right-hand side, you have
carboxylic acid group.
[SPEAKER_02]: This peak shows this part, the green part
of the glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at peak area versus time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the thing you can figure out how
much stuff you have and how it changes the
[SPEAKER_02]: function of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is for PO band and this is for
carboxylic amine group band.
[SPEAKER_02]: So third thing we can find, so this is
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carboxylic amine functionality is
interacting faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this phosphonate is not interacting at
the same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, when increasing PS loading
this way, I'm loading more polysaccharide,
[SPEAKER_02]: we decrease both functionalities and
that's equivalent to less absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason to have two different rates for
one molecule is actually about interfacial
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have only one type of glyphosate
at the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have multiple different types and those
are in different locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in total, in general, we see different
rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one thing I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and if you look at the type of
binding, this is bidentite binding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two oxygen and connected to iron
atom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here only we have one hand or one
bonding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them monodentite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we have polysaccharide,
monodentite bonding is more preferable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really important because
bidentite is much stronger than
[SPEAKER_02]: monodentite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means there's a chance that
glyphosate can be released from
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharide-gloatite association versus
bare-gloatite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I like to dig more in detail and I
looked at the carboxylic acid versus
[SPEAKER_02]: amino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I deconstructed the peaks and this is
the convolution analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found if I looked at the
contribution of these functionalities,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can find how much they are important in
the interaction during adsorption and
[SPEAKER_02]: desorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I found during adsorption with
increasing polysaccharide-gloating
[SPEAKER_02]: ammonium, this functionality here,
these functional groups have more,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting more contribution in the
interaction with the retention of
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes sense actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, amine is positively charged,
so electrostatically they can interact
[SPEAKER_02]: more with the negative charge components
in polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes a tertiary complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polysaccharide, glyphosate, iron oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a chemisorption from the one
side and we have a hydrogen bonding from
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this way, glyphosate can be stabilized
at the surface and then maybe it can have
[SPEAKER_02]: delayed release when you have more
precipitation in off-season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you fall or winter?
[SPEAKER_02]: In summary, sorry, I know now you know why
glyphosate dances on the genital floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So glyphosate retained to less extent we
can find, I'm just counting, so just
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing those peaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And polysaccharide-gloating association,
that means we're gonna have greater
[SPEAKER_02]: transport of glyphosate into water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And polysaccharide association promotes
more monodentate binding, which is less
[SPEAKER_02]: strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the retained glyphosate, that's the
kind of interpolation from those data that
[SPEAKER_02]: says that could be possible to have a
delayed leaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Act three.
[SPEAKER_02]: In act three, I have a different question.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this question, I'm looking at how low
molecular weight, this time,
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharide is high molecular weight
compound in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to know how low molecular
weight developed organic matter can
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with glyphosate and how it
changes their adsorption and retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a binary system this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mixed them together and let them to
absorb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for low molecular weight DOM,
I'm using this peptide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 19 amino acids as a model peptide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before starting to study adsorption,
I was interested to know, is there any
[SPEAKER_02]: traction in solution, so this low
molecular weight and glyphosate can
[SPEAKER_02]: interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used two different techniques,
IR and NMR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in IR, and at the right, the left-hand
side, this spectrum showing glyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: plus peptide sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you compare the lines, dashed lines,
which is from glyphosate and peptide,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see this is just a summation of
those spectrum with no shifts,
[SPEAKER_02]: no shifts for frequencies and no shifts
actually for broadening or shortening of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means there's no attraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested again with a different technique
and then look at those amino acids this
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the NMR TOCSY for peptide sample,
which is a dose of black regime and
[SPEAKER_02]: peptide plus glyphosate sample are shown
by red regimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look, those regimes from peptide
and peptide plus glyphosate, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: already completely covering each other and
there's no differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not moving around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means there's no attraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at glyphosate peptide adsorption
spectra and to know how peptide can change
[SPEAKER_02]: the adsorption rate and capacity and also
how it changes its complexation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data shows here, I looked at this
bonding here, which is a ToFe bonding or
[SPEAKER_02]: can be sorption of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate itself is the signal to the
curve for glyphosate soap plus peptide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see dramatically dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have less adsorption for peptide.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are competing for surface and peptide
is winning this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peptide can sit at the surface and didn't
allow glyphosate to be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is about kinetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also kinetically, glyphosate adsorption is
slower during when it's in a solo system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we have peptide, it's begin
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is chemisorption kinetically is
a slow reaction, but altruistic
[SPEAKER_02]: complexation without chemisorption is
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means peptide is changing binding
top, not only adsorption capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also we found if there is any type of
chemisorption for glyphosate with peptide,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more more than take one, which is a
less strong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summary for that, I can say peptide,
glyphosate adsorption in the presence of
[SPEAKER_02]: peptide decreases the adsorption for
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means we don't have more
transport when we have low molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: weight kind of a soup and plus glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate are not able to sit and find
someplace for it to sit for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes away and stay in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other things as I mentioned,
low molecular weight DOMs like peptide
[SPEAKER_02]: promotes more dentate and altruistic
complexation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those type of binding are very weak
binding and also less strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, we found there is no
interaction in solution and at the surface
[SPEAKER_02]: between glyphosate and peptide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another, which is opposite to
polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_02]: High molecular weight, they interact with
each other, then you have low molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: weight compound, but low molecular weight
and glyphosate, they do not interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last idea is about transformation of
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at adsorption and desorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the question is how can amino
association impact transformation of
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate transformation, I think I
mentioned this, create a omnimethyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, which is toxic as same as glyphosate
for early stage kind of cell development
[SPEAKER_02]: in animals and plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we should look, we should study
omnimethyphosate acid more and look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this compound originates from
transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to know how organic
association can change generation of this
[SPEAKER_02]: product or transformation of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the model mineral is manganese oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two manganese oxide in the system
side, bernesite and hazelite.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manganese oxide, the differences is
they're having different catalytic
[SPEAKER_02]: capability.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is having different content of
manganese 3, 4, or different oxidation
[SPEAKER_02]: states for manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bernesite have more manganese 3 and 4,
but hazelite has more manganese 2 and 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means lower average oxidation state,
lower catalytic capability or oxidative
[SPEAKER_02]: transformation for glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why I'm showing two
interesting pathways in terms of my study.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pathway that create omnimethyphosate
acid or AMPA and glycine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glycine pathway, and the reason we have
two different molecules because this kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of age, a C and C of age can be happening
in two different position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they then can create two different
molecule and two different pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either there's an AMPA or glycine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two steps are really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: One step for transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first step is surface complexation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate absorbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a single electron
transfer reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Electron jumps into the surface and then
we have a radical species and this radical
[SPEAKER_02]: species start to degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glycine is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have glycine only this pathway,
we should be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glycine is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the AMPA is not safe and also it
accumulates more in blacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pathway is a bad pathway and this
pathway is a good pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, is there any interaction between
protein and glyphosate before starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the interaction at surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Protein is high molecular weight
dissolving matter in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was expecting to see interaction and
I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: STDNMR showed this interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this time the interaction was much
stronger than now colon bonding between
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate and protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks shows better signal for STDNMR.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger signal means a stronger now
colon bonding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about absorption first and
then we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first step I said is surface
complexation.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this I use in situ ATR spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I have a very limited surface on
ATR, I'm able to see only detect
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of glyphosate and limited
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: The signal from by product molecule is
negligible and it's not overlapping or
[SPEAKER_02]: interfering with the glyphosate signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can draw some data based on what I'm
seeing and referring that to POMN bonding.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bonding here is a binding between
manganese oxide and glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top we have burnicide, this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this panel has light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna talk about burnicide first.
[SPEAKER_02]: First two line from top side are showing
the experiment of pH 4.6 with that and
[SPEAKER_02]: with BSA protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next two, which are lower,
showing lower absorption, they are pH 7.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increasing pH, decreased absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate became more negative and
surface also gets more negatively charged
[SPEAKER_02]: because those manganese oxide having lower
ZMPC, zero point of charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the pH is above that,
surface became more negative and we have
[SPEAKER_02]: more repulsive force.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about BSA?
[SPEAKER_02]: BSA adding to the system, decreased
absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have less absorption now when we have
BSA at surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter which pH is that,
or even the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the same term even for hasmite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hasmite also showed less absorption
capacity when we add BSA in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the same term for pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So BSA association reduced the extent and
absorption rate for glyphosate on both
[SPEAKER_02]: coated manganese oxides.
[SPEAKER_02]: At higher pH, I said less capacity,
adsorbing capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means so we're gonna have more into
the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: For transformation, I needed to extend the
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to measure by products.
[SPEAKER_02]: My surface needed to be bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I designed a new system, a new
experimental design.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually I'm mimicking the transfer in
for water.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are soil particles and also soil
particles coated with manganese oxide or
[SPEAKER_02]: iron oxide plus organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made BSA manganese oxide chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Protein is loaded onto the manganese oxide
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this glass, slide glass, the glass
slide goes into the microfluidic reactor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we introduce glyphosate in.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a function of time, we collect
effluents and we analyze for byproducts
[SPEAKER_02]: using LC-MS or other photometric
algorithms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a closer view to the burden site
and hasmite chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here on top, this is a cross section of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows how thick it feels to film the
manganese oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for hasmite, for burden site is around
two micrometer and for hasmite is 4.5
[SPEAKER_02]: micrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have different amount of manganese
oxide at the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is very important is the
surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of surface area or total
catalytic surface area, we have almost
[SPEAKER_02]: similar surface area now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're gonna have a fair condition in
terms of surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these two are TGM images of those
crystal particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we are looking at work through curves
from that microfluidic reactors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have burden site and then in the
next slide, we're gonna look at hasmite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sort the result based on pH here.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the left hand side, we have pH 4.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the right hand side, we have pH 7.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom of the panel, we have burden
site with BSA and on top, burden site
[SPEAKER_02]: alone, no BSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: With increasing at greater pH,
transformation became less.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have less byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you compare either pH 4.6 or pH 7.2,
we have glyphosate, sorry, we have protein
[SPEAKER_02]: at the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it diminishes the degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have less transformation for
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of pathways, I calculated how
much of transformation related to AMPA and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much is related to glycine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I measured since I have data for AMPA and
glycine.
[SPEAKER_02]: At pH 4.6, it looks we are going equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have both pathways and they are almost
equal rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increasing pH, it changes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now glycine pathway gets more dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's primarily, we can say it goes
this way, around 70% and 30% that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two numbers here because of the
with BSA and without BSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: With BSA protein at the surface,
we see more AMPA as a pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's 4D, without BSA, it became a 46.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here at pH 7.2, if it was 28, now it
became 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: So BSA association in CREA kind of changed
the pathway toward AMPA, but it still
[SPEAKER_02]: glycizes more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly same trend, not exactly same,
similar trend observed at the surface of
[SPEAKER_02]: azomalite without BSA at close pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, but the ratio between AMPA pathway
and glycine pathway is not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks husband and wife mediate more
glycine pathway, 80% at 4.6 and 86% at
[SPEAKER_02]: 7.2, and there's no difference with having
or not having BSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have exactly the same ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I didn't mention that is
about if there's any chance for to go
[SPEAKER_02]: order transformation for Biprodex,
the way you can say that measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: ammonium, and I didn't detect that
ammonium at the surface of azomalite,
[SPEAKER_02]: but burnersize shows a couple of percent,
like a two to five percent ammonium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it's still burnersize more
catalytically active to digadate
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more step to get ammonium,
phosphate, carbon dioxide and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here I'm summarizing the protein
association impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks active site, I could fight it
by burnersize, by BSA protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it limits the absorption and
subsequently limits transformation rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that we found from STDNMR
study, there is organic-organic
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it changes the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have organic-organic interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So glyphosate has less chance to interact
with the surface and to be degradated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it protects glyphosate from fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that's interesting,
this is studied by many people and they
[SPEAKER_02]: found protein can immobilize and reduce
manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we have reduced surface and that's
another way to have less transformation
[SPEAKER_02]: because catalytic capability drops when we
have reduced surface instead of having
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidized surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the thing I'm proposing for
surface passivation of manganese oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I measured pH and also dissolve
manganese, soluble manganese in effluents
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn how it changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we have glyphosate
transformation, we have an electron
[SPEAKER_02]: transfer from glyphosate to surface and
surface became reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means manganese oxide became
transformed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have not the same surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: The surface changes when we have more
transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the transformation causes higher pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we're gonna have high pH in
solution that diminishes the
[SPEAKER_02]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more soluble manganese in
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means reduced surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it decreases transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, we have glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate can complex with manganese,
reduced manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make a dissociation for surface that
we call ligand promoted dissociation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ligand promoted dissociation decreased
catalytic capability for manganese oxide
[SPEAKER_02]: and another way to passivate surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a negative feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: In long term, if you run this experiment,
the addition of glyphosate gonna become
[SPEAKER_02]: less, less and less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to summarize entire four
acts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I learned and I want to give you
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we have low surface, like a minerals
in soil, say like this, when you add more
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter into the soil and before
more organic association, the surface
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be more hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And less readable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of adsorption and
transformation for glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna have less retention and also
slower adsorption and slower desorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this means more transport into the
ground water or runoff into the streams.
[SPEAKER_02]: For transformation, when you have higher
loading at the surface, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: less transformation because adsorption is
the first step for transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the kind of crucial step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less adsorption, less transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we found the transformation became
less slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we have transformation,
AMPA pronounced more this time compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface without any organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's my conclusion somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be problematic high organic
matter in the soil's environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way, in terms of contaminant
transport and contaminant fate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is the contaminant first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a subsequent kind of
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another bonus thing I want to share is
about organic-organic interaction order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between glyphosate and those high
molecular weight and low molecular weight
[SPEAKER_02]: DOMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on NMR studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So high molecular weight protein is much
stronger to make a non-covalent or
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrogen bonding to glyphosate compared to
peroxide grime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there is no interaction between
low molecular weight molecule like peptide
[SPEAKER_02]: and glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This order suggests that we need to pay
particular attention to the type of DOM in
[SPEAKER_02]: evaluating the behavior of contaminants
and their environmental interfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be water, it could be soil
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I want to acknowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Anita.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past eight years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you supported me and you led me to learn
more about soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to developing skills,
any skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You led me to try anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also my lab mates.
[SPEAKER_02]: My previous lab mates, Michael,
Taylor, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my current lab mates, Amy,
Luna, and Alyssa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is a teamwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not possible to do something like
this alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also not supporting environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: My special committee, they have good
advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I minored environmental processes
and environmental assessment in an
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental engineering school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had time to learn about those things
with Doug, Damian, and Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you for helping me
with measuring TOC, manganese,
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphate, glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not glyphosate, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Autophosphate, because they have IC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bionchromatography.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use CCMR facilities and different
facilities at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: LCMS at BTI.
[SPEAKER_02]: And measuring surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zetasize, zetapotential in an institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've worked with Robert Page to make
that microfluid reactor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those researchers and also some of
those scientists, they are really
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting and inspiring for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Linda Nicholson for supporting me to do
NMR studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mary McBride, you can say his
research, and his attitude is inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm doing here, he started,
I don't know, maybe 30 years ago to study
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just adding a little piece to what he
found in the past 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the people from different places
that did help me to do modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or some that are not shown here,
that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Eugene Elton helped me to do peak
modeling for manganese fractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also my friend, Nassour Lassaberni
helped me to do 1D transport in hydrous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end, my family, my lovely wife,
Riley, and adorable kids, Avin and Lena.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a positive environment and safe
environment for me to do this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also my friends, Saeed, Teddy,
Sonam, I think hopefully you know Sonam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard is my business friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my founder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running a startup company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my founder and his co-founder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Michael Schmidt, Michael Schmidt
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, I'm gonna take
those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Moen Sakurai was diminishing the
ability of the glyphosate to be formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea there is that it's going to
then perhaps reduce the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation by the needle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Moen Sakurai, the first second act is
about adsorption on iron oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on iron oxide, there is no
transformation for glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we see is a pure impact on
adsorption only.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it diminishes adsorption of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I needed to work with another model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's a fair question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had a batch study before
starting the transformation study.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked different organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lignin, polysaccharides, polygalactic
acid, protein, and other stuff that people
[SPEAKER_02]: can detect in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed them with manganese oxide and
started to see the transformation of
[SPEAKER_02]: organics itself before adding glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found proteins more stable at surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means less problematic for me if I
wanna detect the byproducts or I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: have more stable surface to see a
transformation for glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the reason I changed from
polysaccharide to protein on manganese
[SPEAKER_02]: oxides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my follow-up question there is,
in terms of what the behavior is in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like to get chemical
transformation, you need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of enzymatic or microbial
degradation, that's gonna be maximized in
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so potentially you have one form of
transformation is when you're on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, but then processes that are
inhibiting that form of transformation
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually enhance microbial
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the behavior of the system,
what would be best for degrading
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want it to stick to the surface or
do you want it to not stick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a fair and valid fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not at surface, more available for
bacteria, more available for enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can be detected both those are biotically
instead of abiotically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good to follow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now system needs to be have a
microbe, how it's gonna be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic association and microbe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's could be something to, yeah,
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so for the interest of time,
I think, thank you very much, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
