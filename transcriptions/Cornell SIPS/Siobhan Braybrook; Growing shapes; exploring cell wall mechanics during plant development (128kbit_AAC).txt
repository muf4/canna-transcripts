[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to focus on one
particular problem that we're working on
[SPEAKER_00]: that has nothing to do with seaweeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plants, which is useful, I think,
for this audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's talking about anisotropic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll see in particular is that
we're focusing on the hypocotyl as a
[SPEAKER_00]: system to study this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, there's lots of places
within a plant where anisotropy will
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extending these principles beyond that
will be something that we're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if I can figure out how to
use the pointer in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our general question in the lab is
trying to ask how shapes get grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: walled organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say plants and algae because I don't
really look at yeast or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at multicellular walled
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it presents a really interesting
physical challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a wall that's surrounding each
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, for the most part, connecting
cells to each other and connecting tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so physically speaking, when you want
to have coordinated growth that gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: a shape or a pattern, you need to have
coordination of that physical process of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, as you'll see,
I consider that as something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated by the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of some of the
systems that we look at and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms we'll use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned, we're really going to
focus on maybe just doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can dance around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on the hypocotyl
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you want to understand how shapes
are grown, oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're talking about a cell shape
or the shape of a tissue or a whole organ,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, you need to be able to
quantify shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do quite a bit of differential
geometry to look at how shapes change in
[SPEAKER_00]: time and how you can quantitatively
describe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to talk about how you
actually think that change in shape comes
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we look at some physical
principles and also some material science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell wall is material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to look at how the
cell wall biochemistry relates to those
[SPEAKER_00]: material changes and how the cell biology
underlies that change in the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, of course, I'm a
developmental biologist at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really interested in how the
signals from the genetic program get
[SPEAKER_00]: translated into this physical change in
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, what I'm going to focus on when
I start learning how to use the computer
[SPEAKER_00]: is mostly these two here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of cell wall changes are
happening during anisotropic growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think maybe some of the regulatory
mechanisms for that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be a little bit of material
science at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my diagram of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joss, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an incredibly stylized,
really simplified description of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: think a cell wall looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pointing out that, of course,
as some people in the audience will know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really know what the cell wall
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know there are cellulose fibers in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that's embedded somehow
within a pectinaceous matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pectin is the chemical I'm going to
talk most about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also the cross-links
hemicelluloses that can happen in between
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to learn a little bit
more about the architecture of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an incredibly difficult
structural thing to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the things that I'm going
to say about the mechanics of the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, we're taking a lot of assumptions
into the structure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, we'll learn more about the
structure and link that to the mechanics
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a big grain of salt, we think
that the cell wall has these strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid fibers whose orientation can affect
the material properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have the matrix within which
they're embedded, which is what I'll focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our questions about the mechanical
structure of the chemical cell wall is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does the wall change during growth and
shape formation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What component of the wall or components
might be important for cell growth or
[SPEAKER_00]: shape growth, and how they actually
mediate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually also how we can test the
properties of the wall in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as Adrienne mentioned, I've been
involved a lot in using atomic force
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy as a way to test the material
properties of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go into that a little bit for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, what I'm going to do is focus on
the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at a role for pectin
methylation in hypocotyl anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to look at how maybe
modulating anisotropy could have some
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting functional consequences for a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just saying, oh,
that's a cool microscopy picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: why it might actually be useful to change
your anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the very end, if we have time,
I'll do a little bit of what we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at to actually link the biochemistry of
pectin to the material properties of gels
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we can translate that back into a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably a little bit supluferous
for this audience, but the hypocotyl is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located between the root meristem and
the shoot meristem in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: dicotyledonous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to happen is you need
this extreme anisotropic elongation of
[SPEAKER_00]: this organ to get the apex out of the soil
so you can start getting photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity happening in producing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this happens from the point of
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting this massive anisotropic
elongation of this organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the study system we're going
to work with today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it's important for the
early success of plants as crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that happens in their life
is germination, but after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to get out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the ways that we watch this
happening is by simulating a continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: reach for the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow seedlings in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Arabidopsis hypocotyls growing
in the dark and visualized using infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we can do is essentially make
it so they never think they get out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're just going to continue this
elongation until they run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we can do from that is we can
monitor length over time in really precise
[SPEAKER_00]: ways so we can get quantitative
descriptions of this elongation as it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start doing some fun things at the
end, which I'm not going to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like these wiggles as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as anisotropic growth goes,
that elongation more in one direction than
[SPEAKER_00]: another, we have both a direction for
anisotropy but also a magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direction of the hypocotyl is pretty
much always up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that it goes up and then it
starts getting fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a continual direction for the
anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the magnitude actually changes in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to show you in the next
slide is that you start off relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: slow, but then it gets faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that magnitude has to do with
differential regulation of the elongation
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and the width growth of cells,
which I'll also show you some data for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take our movies and we quantify
the length of the hypocotyl over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've probably seen this before,
because this is a well-known phenomenon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with what some people call a
sigmoidal growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of slow increase in length at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a transition around 24
hours after germination to this more rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're sort of tunneling
down into.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things is what's controlling
this transition to the rapid elongation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also underlying that is what's making
sure that most of the growth is going into
[SPEAKER_00]: length and not length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're trying to do
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we looked at the
cellular level as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know what cells were doing
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been done once before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was with scanning electron
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really just looked at cell length
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about it, cell length and
width, that ratio is what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you only ever measure length,
you may be losing some information by not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening in this colorful slide
is mostly the elongation of the hypocotyl
[SPEAKER_00]: happens by cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of division,
at least in the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows us to track or
pseudo-track cells by position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one to 17 cells per file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these are growing in the dark,
as soon as you take them out to image
[SPEAKER_00]: them, they stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pseudo time series by sampling at
each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then what we can do is we can say,
well, this is cell one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can calculate individual growth
curves and individual growth rates by
[SPEAKER_00]: position along that file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that you'll see is,
if you just look at the top of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's that transition to fast
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you may know already,
which is known in the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that all the cells don't start
elongating at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you get this what we call an
acropedal wave of elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cells at the base start elongating
before the cells up near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens in a wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it really nicely here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still small cells in length
here, whereas these are elongating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wave of elongation actually
travels up the length of the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have what looks like a pretty
simple behavior, slow growth, fast growth
[SPEAKER_00]: for the whole organ, but it's underlaid by
this interesting wave of elongation that
[SPEAKER_00]: moves from the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us to look at elongating
and non-elongating cells or fast and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: elongating cells at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's over here is the first real
measurements of width that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that the change in
width doesn't show that acropedal wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cells are expanding in width very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a full order of magnitude
different scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're expanding in width really
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not having that position
dependent control of where that growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: width is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get that sharp transition to
a fast growth either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really is indicating that the
growth in width and the growth in length
[SPEAKER_00]: are somehow being independently regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is the cellular level mechanism
by which that organ level behavior is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we wanted to ask was how that
transition to rapid growth was achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that really means is what's
happening at the base where those cells
[SPEAKER_00]: are elongated versus the top where they
haven't started quickly elongating yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also how that direction going
more up than in width is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's obvious roles here for
cellulose orientation, which everyone will
[SPEAKER_00]: know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to hope to add to that a
little bit today with a pectin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get that transition in rapid
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back to this data,
we're really interested in that sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: transition where things start getting
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because the cells at the base are
starting to elongate much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us to ask this question
about the cell wall chemistry between the
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and slowly elongating cells at one
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of some work that we've
done previously in philataxis looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: pectin chemistry, we knew that there was
some link between pectin and where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see that transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to ask whether or not we
could see similar changes in pectin
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry here along the hypocotyl due to
that expansion gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce
homogallacteronam to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the most biochemical the
slide gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people in this room whose
biochemistry is better than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, in arabidopsis,
the major cell wall pectin is
[SPEAKER_00]: homogallacteronam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really simple chain of
galacturonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes out into the cell wall,
it's esterified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these little orange balls are meant to
be those methyl ester groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will happen once you're sort of
in the cell wall is that you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: selectively deesterified by Pac-Man or
pectin methylesterase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then takes off some of these methyl
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what can happen there is that you
can then cross-link with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this really canonical calcium
gelation that will happen in pectin gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's analogous to what happens in
alginate, although the chemistry is
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get this calcium cross-linking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get rigidification of a gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've got in this table is sort of
what we predict the mechanical character
[SPEAKER_00]: of gels made of these different types of
pectin should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you can't calcium cross-link,
you should be generally more soft as a
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you can calcium cross-link,
you should be more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like making jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're setting the jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some antibodies that actually
let us look at the presence of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different epitopes within the cell wall,
which is what we're going to look at next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can make some hypotheses about what
we think might be happening with respect
[SPEAKER_00]: to growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the pectin is more methylated,
it should be more soft, maybe even more
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth should be easier in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell wall material should deform more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus when you have calcium
cross-linking, things are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: tougher, and it might be harder for the
cell wall to actually extend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason that this one in the
center says it's possibly rigid is because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are more complicated dynamics that
can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have demethylated pectin degraded
by polygalacteronase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're chopping your pectin up,
that's definitely going to be a softer gel
[SPEAKER_00]: than if it's just sitting there without
calcium cross-linking, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually chopping up the pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you have PME activity
doesn't mean you're always going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on presence of
polygalacteronases and also presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's take a look at what these
antibodies look like in that elongating
[SPEAKER_00]: hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to mention that we also have some
proteins that we can use called
[SPEAKER_00]: pectomethylesterase inhibitors that
basically stop this enzyme from
[SPEAKER_00]: deesterifying the pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we predict that they should keep the
pectin in a more fluid state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you overexpressed PMEs,
you might end up with pectin in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come back to that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so these are transverse sections of
hypocotyls at 24 hours post germination
[SPEAKER_00]: when we know the basal cells are actively
quickly elongating and these top cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly elongating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so LM20, this is the methylated
pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully what you can see here is that
there's more signal down at the base than
[SPEAKER_00]: there is at the top, although the
quantifications with these things can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I caution you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up in the slow growing cells,
we definitely have more labeling with the
[SPEAKER_00]: two rigid or possibly rigid antibodies for
HG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means, if you look down at
the base, is that you should have more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fluid pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up at the top, you should have more of
the rigid pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is that the cells at the
base are able to elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or part of the reason they're able to
elongate is because you're keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: pectin in a more fluid state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting delivered and it's not
getting converted into the more rigid able
[SPEAKER_00]: pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if that's true, can we actually
test that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the atomic force
microscopy comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I'll start this movie while I
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an image of an AFM experiment
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have is a very small tip
here, which is actually going to do tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: indentations along the surface of the
hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're limited to looking at the
epidermis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can poke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what you're doing is
asking, if I apply a force, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the surface of this table, if I apply
the same force to the table, how much does
[SPEAKER_00]: it indent the table versus how much that
force would indent my arm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by looking at the force and
deformation that you get at different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas along the hypocotyl or between two
different materials like me and the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn something about their
material properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do this quickly, you're going
to be looking at the elasticity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do that at the base of the
hypocotyl at four hours, so when
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's going really slowly,
this is the transition to rapid growth at
[SPEAKER_00]: the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when things are really kicking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can see is that this number we get
called the indentation modulus is going
[SPEAKER_00]: down in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an indentation modulus just relates
the force to the deformation that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the higher it is, the more force
you need to apply to get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower it is, the more force you
need to apply to get the same deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower it is, the less force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it implies that the material is getting
more elastic over time, which correlates
[SPEAKER_00]: really well with this increasing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens if we alter pectin
chemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on our predictions of what's soft
and what's allowing growth to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we mess with the homogallacteronan
structure, we mess with its mechanics,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we'll also change growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to go back to those two
enzymes, the PME and the PMEI,
[SPEAKER_00]: the inhibitor, to try and change the kind
of pectin that's in the cell wall and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens to growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a little reminder for you,
so PME is catalyzing the removal of methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should allow pectin, if there's
not a lot of polygalacteronase present,
[SPEAKER_00]: to calcium cross-link and become more
rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have inducible PMEI,
that should block PME's activity and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: you more in this fluid state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done this with
alcohol-inducible PME and PMEI lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are only one PME and one PMEI,
and there's about 60 to 70 of each family
[SPEAKER_00]: in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of these genes out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this particular case, we're just
taking one PME and one PMEI and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens if we inducibly overexpress
them to the growth of the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see here in gray is that
normal non-transgenic but treated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: inducer, which in this case is ethanol,
we get the slow growth and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when you overexpress the
PME is that you kind of just always have
[SPEAKER_00]: slow growth and you never get that rapid
transition, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done the biochemistry to look at
this, because you're only having
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion of all the pectin into that
calcium cross-linked form, or pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's really rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite is true when you have the
PMEI, which keeps all the pectin that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out in that fluid state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're growing much more quickly
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of have a more flat, fast growth
throughout the growth of the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the predicted changes we would
expect on an organ level, but also a cell
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of the way the induction works,
we don't see the phenotype right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it sort of at 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is cell length.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same at the time of
induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 24 hours later, you can see that the
wave of elongation is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cell index from the base to
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PMEI cells are a lot longer at the
base versus the PME cells, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty short all the way along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having that change in the organ
and the change in the cells predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will note that we still don't know why
changing pectin elasticity actually has
[SPEAKER_00]: that effect on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the actual physical thing that's
happening in the cell wall that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: because your gel is rigid, you can grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what happens is that PME
blocks this rapid growth phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and PMEI is promoting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would want to see is that we
can see the change in mechanics that we
[SPEAKER_00]: also expect to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so luckily, that also works out with
the AFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm showing you the AFM data in a
map, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each point along this is a single
indentation experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get some spatial information as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have PME expression,
things are generally more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that indentation modulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher this is, the more rigid the
cell walls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have PMEI, and things are a
lot softer, more elastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll note that these experiments are done
in plasmalitic conditions because the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall is quite thin compared to the turgor
pressure inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing these indentation
experiments, depending on how you do them,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes you need to reduce the turgor
pressure so you're not just measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure when you're poking on a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll show you a graph now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more quantitative,
but you can see that the indentation
[SPEAKER_00]: modulus of the non-transgenic is almost
halfway between when you induce PME and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you induce PMEI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're having that mechanical effect
and the effect on growth we'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this all sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I want to ask this question about
how the direction in anisotropy is
[SPEAKER_00]: achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you might have noticed if I go
back one is one of the things you get is
[SPEAKER_00]: some spatial information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might notice that these transverse
walls appear to be more rigid in the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-transgenic than these elongating
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really easy way to explain that is
because these walls are just thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you push on something that's
thinner, it will feel softer, regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: of if the material is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know we've actually done some
measurements on cell wall thickness here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the walls are maintaining
the same type of thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's a bit more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually due to this chemical
difference in the pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those walls appear to be more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slow walls that might control width
expansion are more rigid than the
[SPEAKER_00]: elongating axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's investigate that a little bit
more when we ask how that direction in
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropy is achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at 24 hours, which is close
to what you saw before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at 48 with the induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And already we can see these walls are
more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fast elongating axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even at four hours post-termination,
when everything's growing really slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can still see that there's a difference
already in these transverse versus axial
[SPEAKER_00]: walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's set up pretty
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coincident with the fact that
that growth is always anisotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always elongating more in length
than you are in width.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it gets faster past 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done some quantification of
this as well, which is maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at four hours, we can see that there is
a difference between the transverse and
[SPEAKER_00]: axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transverse walls are more stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see everything gets a bit softer by 24
hours, which is what I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can still see that this
maintenance of the ratio between slow and
[SPEAKER_00]: fast growing walls is maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you may also have noticed that
pectin could be involved in this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the PME and PMEI over
expresses, which we'll look at again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've actually abolished that difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're looking at longitudinal
sections of hypocotyls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at hypocotyl cells near
the base at four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to look at 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, even at four hours,
we could see this difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: elasticity of the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I have marked here with red
asterisks are endosperm sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is epidermal files marked in
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to orient yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can hopefully see is that in
the epidermal file, these two more rigid
[SPEAKER_00]: pectin markers have higher signal on the
transverse walls than they tend to have on
[SPEAKER_00]: the axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite is true for the softer
pectin marker, LM20, where you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: signal on the axial walls and less on the
transverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are really tricky to do
quantitatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it jives pretty well with the
mechanical measurements that we can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at this at 24 hours as
well and see once these cells are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to elongate, we're again seeing a little
bit more of the rigid markers on these
[SPEAKER_00]: transverse walls here, more of the soft
pectin on the elongating walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it gets a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some rigid pectin on that
elongating wall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as simple as saying,
well, if you have this pectin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have this pectin, you won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really difficult right now to
work out that quantitative relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty difficult, especially with
these techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have differences in elasticity
between slow and fast growing walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same difference is mirrored between
the slow and fast growing regions of that
[SPEAKER_00]: acropedal wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can correlate really nicely the
chemistry of the pectin with the
[SPEAKER_00]: elasticity of the walls and growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go back to those PME and PMEI
over-expressors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that the ratio between the
transverse and axial walls has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the non-transgenic treated with ethanol
shows the rate difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the PME, everything is rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PMEI, everything is soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that before I showed you
the length of the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm actually showing you the
length versus the width.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the PMEI cells are way
more anisotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratio between the transverse and
axial walls has actually disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratio of length to width is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PME cells are less anisotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're affecting the anisotropy as well
as the elongation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question that came up in the
literature based on this observation is
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not elastic asymmetry is
actually enough on its own to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropic growth in the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just pretend that cellulose
anisotropy doesn't exist, if you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: stiffer Ross walls than you do axial
walls, is that enough to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropic growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a little bit of
computational modeling with Henrik
[SPEAKER_00]: Jansson's group at the Sainsbury Lab in
Cambridge to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all the assumptions that go
into your model change, perhaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your outcomes will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this with a finite element
method model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can prescribe material properties to
the different cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say, you should be more elastic or
less elastic than these other direction
[SPEAKER_00]: walls and ask then if we simulate growth,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's using a modified Lockhart model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured about a twofold difference
between the transverse and axial walls and
[SPEAKER_00]: elasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add that in, the thing just
balloons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that twofold difference in elasticity
is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we're not getting the true
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you pump it up to a 100-fold
difference, it is enough to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking at for the colors
here are how anisotropic the strain or
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the direction of the
anisotropy is shown here with the white
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no nothing, just everybody's all
the same, you end up growing more in
[SPEAKER_00]: width.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do this 100-fold difference in
elasticity between these walls and these
[SPEAKER_00]: walls, then you can get some elasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did next is we simulated some
anisotropy from cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the hypocaudal, it's not
straightforward in the way that it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Green's original work in Nutella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those instances, you have cellulose
fibers wrapping around the girth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is meant to control the
anisotropy.
So what we did next is we simulated some
anisotropy from cellulose.
And in the hypocaudal, it's not
straightforward in the way that is in Paul
Green's original work in Nutella.
But the second thing that we did was we
simulated some anisotropy from cellulose
fibers.
And in the hypocaudal, it's not
straightforward in the way that is in Paul
Green's original work in Nutella.
So here you have cellulose fibers supposed
to be not only fibrous but that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: rather smaller, and so it's meant to
restrict expansion and width.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can allow those fibers to slip
apart, you can facilitate growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this canonical way of
controlling anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some organs, that tends to be true,
and some species, that tends to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, we're looking at the
epidermis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a rabidopsis, the epidermis doesn't
show really strong alignment of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know now is that the cortex shows
pretty strong alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done in these simulations is
not say that the epidermis itself has to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that material cellulose anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just providing it either from the
interface of these cells or, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you'll see next is from inside layers
of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter where that information comes
from, what happens is that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropic growth when you have cellulose
anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you add on this two-fold difference
in wall elasticity, you actually get more
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stronger anisotropy and it's faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sort of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with the two-fold elastic
asymmetry added.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after growth, you can see this
cylinder is a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the degree of anisotropy is a little
bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even more profound if you
simulate internal anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these numbers are kind of just
made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you see that additional thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we think is that this pectine
asymmetry in the epidermis, it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing controlling anisotropy,
but it's helping anisotropy to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping that growth to happen a
little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's making sure that those walls are
elongating a little bit faster than these
[SPEAKER_00]: transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a really good example of
a really important developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, we want to know what
regulates that anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have an answer for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at some cytoskeletal
dynamics and delivery and endocytosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: exocytosis balance, but also some of these
other modifying enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they get delivered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they activated?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we might also be interested in whether
or not the regulation of anisotropy can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you want to get out of the
ground faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems to make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to the second point,
which is looking at modulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: anisotropy and growth plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little guy has to elongate out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense you might want to do that
quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can photosynthesize
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You establish yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you beat some neighbors out of your
shade competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get out faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You establish yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of environmental
variability that they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of soil do they have to go
through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the compaction of the soil change
whether you'd want to grow thin and fast
[SPEAKER_00]: or fat and slow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much carbon and other nutrients are
available to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you want to respond to that in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these complicating
factors that go into saying, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe being faster isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we noticed in the lab is that
if you grow a rabidopsis, this is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a rabidopsis on plates with
sucrose, their anisotropy is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it looks like in this video is
that these are shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slower and they're shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, you would think,
well, maybe that's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we calculated their volume and
their volumetric growth, what we saw is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're growing the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just patricianing that time,
my English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're giving less growth in length
and a little bit more in width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the volume maintains, but their
patricianing, I need to stop saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: word, is different in length and width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have sucrose, you're less
anisotropic.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you that this is not based
on ethylene, which is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll know that the triple response
involves you getting really short and
[SPEAKER_00]: really fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do this in the ACS ethylene
synthesis octuple mutant, you still get
[SPEAKER_00]: this response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not dependent on there being
ethylene present, which is a good control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also happens no matter what kind of
sugar you throw on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the anisotropy index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be the ratio of length to
width.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see normally they're way
longer than they are wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put them on sucrose, that drops
because they're getting fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens if you have sucrose,
glucose, dextrose, sucrose, galactose,
[SPEAKER_00]: trihalose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't appear to be specific to any
one carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other interesting thing is that if
you chop off the cotyledons, which are an
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous source of carbon, you mimic the
low sucrose condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you add little grains of sand back
on top to be a weight, that doesn't rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as if it's because they're
lighter, they grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it really is something to do with
the available relief carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can rescue that cotyledon removal
non-sucrose mimic by actually adding
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose back in lanolin to the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like it's that carbon source
that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we don't know is how this is
being sensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is something there that's
changing this anisotropic ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see this at a cellular level as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 0% sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that increase in length of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just looking at one cell in the
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, you're seeing less growth in
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also width, remember, you don't really
see much of a wave in width in the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're seeing a little bit of a wave
now here when you have the sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, the width growth rate
is getting regulated, perhaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: by that same acropedal wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an interesting shift there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there cell wall changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they're related to pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these can be really difficult to
quantitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is immuno for the LM20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's the softer pectin,
what we expect to be more fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that in the 3%
sucrose case, we're starting to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: signal at these transverse walls than we
ever had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like an empty column in the
0%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're getting some on these
transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratio between the two is getting
closer to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting more soft pectin on that
wall that's now elongating a bit more and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you that shift to width growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get more methylated homoglycerin
into the transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the converse is also true with the
demethylated pectin, although it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantitatively, we can see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the quantification's, again,
a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a shift away from those
transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting less rigid pectin there,
more soft pectin, which might relate to
[SPEAKER_00]: why you're getting that width growth that
you don't normally get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see an interesting effect when
we look with the AFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to change the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: That literally makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can call it figure seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do the AFM, again, these are the
basal cells that are elongating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'll see is that these look more
rigid than the 0% sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see they're a bit fatter than
these, which makes sense given the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements I've shown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also looks like we're getting rid
of that ratio, that difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: transverse and axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's just some quantification of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 0% case where you see that
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's less of a difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, everybody's more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the ratio of the transverse to
axial, which normally favors stiffer axial
[SPEAKER_00]: transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we've kind of gotten rid of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so this is kind of weird,
though, because now I'm showing you that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell walls are stiffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know they're still growing
volumetrically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my walls are stiffer, how do I still
end up growing the same amount even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it's proportioned a little bit
differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was puzzling to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went in and asked, well,
is the pressure any different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're estimating pressure here
based on Plasmalis' point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a perfect method, but it's
what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that in 3%
sucrose, the pressure is actually higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in cells at the base when they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the walls may be stiffer, but they
balance that out somehow by regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: their pressure so that the pressure to
wall stiffness ratio is still facilitating
[SPEAKER_00]: the same amount of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something, again, there's an
interesting feedback there that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure how it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that kind of dynamic actually
out of a classical Lockhart model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing some modeling to look at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's unclear what the actual mechanism
might be in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're interested in auxin
because it's plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that changes in pectin can be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking a little bit at auxin
transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of pin 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are auxin efflux carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can change the direction of
auxin flow depending on the polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the 0% sucrose case,
what we get is something that's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: not very polar at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of around the whole cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe here you can see it's a little
bit stronger signal on the transverse
[SPEAKER_00]: walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a bit of quantification
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more signal on transverse
walls than you do the axial walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're elongating walls with sucrose,
which means you end up with something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have more pin 3 on these
membranes, which will drive more flow
[SPEAKER_00]: across those walls to get more auxin flow
across those transverse walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that's facilitating their
growth, perhaps through acid growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is impaired in a pin 3 mutant,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there pH changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We might expect that if there's more auxin
flow across that transverse wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe we're going to see a drop in
pH, if you believe acid growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been using this apofusion
fluorescent protein system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is you have RFP,
which is pH insensitive, and GFP,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pH sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the ratio between the two,
because they're both produced by the same
[SPEAKER_00]: construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go to the same apoplastic space
in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, what is the ratio between
green and red?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should tell you something about
the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of the system, because this will
get lower when you have more acidic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our rough estimates, again,
this is sort of preliminary, is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH ratio between the transverse and axial
walls sort of is dropping in the 1.5%
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sort of look at that as meaning
that we're getting lower pH on those
[SPEAKER_00]: walls, where more auxin is predicted to be
flowing across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think there's some acid growth
change that's giving this difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: width versus length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is impaired in proton pump
mutants, but also if you add vancomycin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an inhibitor of these proton
pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the summary of this part goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that there's this change in polar
transport of auxin that changes the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that's doing something probably
to PMEs and PMEIs on those transverse
[SPEAKER_00]: walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some hints that xyloglucan
structure is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing a little bit on these walls
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be activating other enzymes
like expansins, which we know are
[SPEAKER_00]: canonically activated by changes in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the net result is we think these
transverse walls in the sucrose condition
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing a little bit faster than they
normally would, which gives you this
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly slower growing hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting a little bit fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you remember, I was kind of
interested in whether it mattered that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were a little bit slower and a little bit
fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody care?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've designed some tests to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're just starting to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at success of
emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could imagine just being
faster, again, is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you get out and you start
photosynthesizing, and you are the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have different substrates,
that might not be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not the best substrates,
but it's what we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using coarse sand and fine sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different particle sizes that
you have to navigate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thickness of the layer on top of
this seed on the plate is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we orient the seeds so they're already
ready to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to do any weird turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the sort of thing that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have coarse sand, the skinny,
fast one actually does a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have fine sand, the slow one
does a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea would be that it's not always
advantageous to be fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always advantageous to be slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow, if you can sense it,
sensing your environment and the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: availability allows you to change this
anisotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may be a little bit more
successful than your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's obviously a pretty complicated
matrix of interactions that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very quickly going to tell you a
little bit about pectin gel mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been kind of going through
and telling you, oh, well, pectin gel is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's stiffer, that changes growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to know a little bit more
about that as a material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you translate from this to the
actual wall structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we've been doing this is by
really pulling stuff way out of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: system and just making some synthetic
materials and testing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I'll show you some pure pectin
gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've developed another test with the
AFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will probably be familiar with
creep tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are classical tests that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you took a section of hypocotyl,
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you clamp it at one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you throw a weight on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just measure the deformation over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of these really fast elastic
responses that I've been talking about all
[SPEAKER_00]: along, what we wanted to do is actually
look at the way that the material flowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because maybe that's a little bit closer
to growth than an elastic band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good viscoelastic material to think
about, which is essentially what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: testing here, is a memory foam mattress,
which I got to sleep on last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get in it, you sink a little
bit over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some time dependence in your
deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get off, at least when I get
off, it takes a while to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this time delay that might be a
little bit more realistically related to
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the classical creep experiment
involves a weight on a whole organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've simply miniaturized that using
the AFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we push and hold a force and ask how
the material relaxes away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's stress relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can push and hold the deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, you're asking about that
time deformation that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take the data that we get and
we put it through a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: really basic material models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we call a standard linear solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have elasticity from these springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the viscous flow from these
dashpots, like a plunger and a syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get parameters for these
different things out of your models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do this in pectin gels,
what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here are pectin gels that
have different amounts of methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 33% methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that is available to calcium
cross-link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that instantaneous
stiffness, which is analogous to the
[SPEAKER_00]: indentation modulus earlier, is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the less methylation you have,
the more calcium cross-links you can make,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stiffer you come.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we would predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also what's been predicted from food
science reality for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we have done is taken gels that
have different percentages of methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here, half of it is
methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's a lot softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something in between, it's not a
linear relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken it another step further and
we've remade an average 41% demethylation
[SPEAKER_00]: by mixing 33 and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that it's not quite the
same as when the average is actually 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could imagine in a cell wall,
it's not just that every single
[SPEAKER_00]: hemoglobacteron in chain has exactly 50%
methylation, but you might have some that
[SPEAKER_00]: have 70 and some that have 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that those synergistic
combination of those things change the
[SPEAKER_00]: material properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the viscoelasticity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can pull out of this is
something called relaxation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I'm going to show you is
not the relaxation time, but I will tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that what happens is that the gels are
less stiff the more methylation you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also less viscous,
so they're less thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it makes sense that growth,
you might want your material to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: elastic, but also have a bit more flow in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way that we look at this,
the easiest way to look at this from the
[SPEAKER_00]: models is actually to look at the ratio of
elasticity and viscosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because the elasticity changes,
in order for that ratio to remain
[SPEAKER_00]: constant, you have to have the viscosity
changing in the opposite manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we end up knowing that as your
pectin methylation goes down, so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: more available for crosslinks,
you get stiffer and you flow less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we see that in a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go back to this case where we have
more rigid transverse walls and more
[SPEAKER_00]: elastic axial walls, and we do these
viscoelastic creep tests there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that we do see a
difference in elasticity from our model,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pectin chemistry doesn't just affect
elasticity, it's also affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the material to flow,
which may be more related to growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to show that that is
actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the last thing we don't have very
much data on yet is we're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: build more complex materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do this, we use cellulose from
this bacteria, glucinocidobacter zilinus,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes cellulose outside its body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that cellulose and add in other
cell wall components, so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture isn't going to be the same
exactly as a cell wall, but hopefully we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get some information from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just test these big hunks of
material for their material properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can control them a bit better than
we can, say, in a mutant in a rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a very brief example of some of
the things that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have cellulose, cellulose plus
pectin, cellulose and xylaglucan,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get differences in the weight,
so the hydration, which makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: pectin is a little bit wetter,
can hold more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get changes in the depths of the
material, so actually xylaglucan looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's really linking things more
tightly, so proportionally of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cellulose in all these gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that you're getting a thinner
material because of the xylaglucan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have some difference in Young's
modulus as well, but we're just starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to explore this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're hoping is by precisely
controlling the components in the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might get a better idea of what's
actually happening in a plant cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last slide, going very long,
is that we're starting to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: AFM-based mechanical measures on sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember, everything I've showed
you is from the epidermis, but all those
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue layers are connected to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might want to know something
about internal cells and their mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm showing you right now is
the Miscampus stem cryo-sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't gone through any fixation at
all or embedding, except in OCT media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, we're just looking at
vascular bundles because those are
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously going to be really mechanically
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're hoping to be able to look at
primary cell walls as well that don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: these really rigid polymers, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you can see here, the phloem is
softer than the sieve elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are softer than the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see some interesting
differences between sieve elements and
[SPEAKER_00]: companion cells here within the phloem as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can relate this to some
interesting galactan epitopes as well
[SPEAKER_00]: through work with Paul Knox, and that'll
be coming out in plant fizz pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just shows that if you keep pushing
the method, hopefully we can start asking
[SPEAKER_00]: even more questions and not just relying
only on the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you'll do that when you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, most of this, pretty much all of this
work that I've talked about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: was done at the lab in Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Adrienne moved, we've moved,
as Adrienne mentioned, we're now at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're continuing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people who did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two post-docs for us, Buda here and Tom
Turowd, and two PhD students, JJ Ten and
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So material scientists and mathematician,
wild biochemists, and cell biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interdisciplinary effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about the atomic force
measurements and whether we're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult to do that with the
way the machines work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually have to do it with a
constant force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do the creep tests,
we are choosing forces that give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: same deformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did you choose the force?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the plants, what we tend to do,
and again, this is really hand-wavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to say, well, we want an
indentation depth that's no more than 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the depth of, say, the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to make sure we're still
in an elastic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're still in an
elastic regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really hand-wavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the rules that have been
used to model and determine these
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters from these experiments are with
solid materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant cell walls are cellular solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some complicated geometry
that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, we try and get either 5% of
the depth of the wall or 5% of the depth
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cell, depending on the type of
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things we're doing now is
sticking an AFM, an appealed epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: layer on top of an inverted confocal,
and actually looking at what the
[SPEAKER_00]: deformation of the cell looks like under
AFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as beautiful and
straightforward as a Hertzian model would
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you change the force and then do
everything at a different constant force,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're checking a little more the
longitudinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher the force, the more the
longitudinal performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the gels, we've done this a little
bit more carefully because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can look at, if you increase
your indentation depth or force,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at the linearity of the
response and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gels look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit worried about doing those
kinds of experiments right now in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because what we think is happening is
at one point, you'll deform a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be deforming the whole wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be deforming those walls and
the cross walls, and maybe the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not as straightforward as you
would expect based on simple material
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics, because you have that cellular
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe we can talk about it a bit after
too.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the hypocotyl know to go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So please correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it has to do with statoliths in
the endoderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the endodermis in the hypocotyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's gravity-sensing
starch-containing granules that change
[SPEAKER_00]: probably auxin transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep it growing up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that follows up on what Brandy's
question was getting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, I noticed that you had hotspots
where the three anticlinal walls come
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've got more solid material in
that location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a Poisson effect,
kind of a mechanical constraint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question there is, how do you
compensate for that extent?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other, not question, but
observation is that you show that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: have more fine sand, the sucrose which
causes an expansion, they're more
[SPEAKER_03]: successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that makes sense because if you
look at the circumferential expansion,
[SPEAKER_03]: it propagates a fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better at pushing through those
grains, which are more densely packed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fine grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go back to the first point,
which is, and especially this has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're doing sections as well,
an AFMM section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get these sort of nice tri-junction
middle lamellae areas where what everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: does right now, and whether or not that's
a good thing to do, is they assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have an incompressible material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these equations, you're using a
Poisson ratio of 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make a lot of assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, and definitely, so the wall,
because that geometry becomes important as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, as you said, because you have a
thicker amount of material, it may appear
[SPEAKER_00]: stiffer because it has less room to move
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't started doing that yet,
but there's a lot of simulations you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do, simulated indentations in finite
element models, which could be a way for
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just make a section and indent on
it in silico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just one more question that I was
interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assumed, and correct me if I'm wrong,
that when you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: pectins, you're talking about the pectins
within the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, what is happening in the
middle lamellae and the galacto-euronic
[SPEAKER_03]: acids that are binding the cells together,
particularly where you have those three
[SPEAKER_03]: anticlinal walls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can repeat the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's asking, so I'm making some
conclusions about pectin in the cell wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not making distinctions between
where in the cell wall we're looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the middle lamellae which is
responsible for the adhesion of cells
[SPEAKER_00]: together is that different than,
say, the proximal primary cell wall to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, which may be more growth regulatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our measurements right now haven't been
fine enough to really tell us the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between middle lamellae and
proximal, like right next to the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: My postdoc for us is really interested in
looking at cell adhesion and its
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he started looking at some actin
mutants that we can see have mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: different clinical differences,
but I'm hoping that this section
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, really fine tips, really fine
scans, might actually let us see
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in middle lamellae versus
primary cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably the best way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the galactan paper that's coming out in
Plant Fizz, we can see that there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a single wall, in a sieve element,
there's a gradient of binding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: antibody for galactan, and there's a
gradient of mechanics across the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to be able to see that
kind of resolution, but we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have the answers yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is whether we've seen any
change in plasma dismata number,
[SPEAKER_00]: size, maybe even opening with changes in
pectum methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't looked, so that is a bad answer
for you, but it is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: One might expect that the more rigid the
gel gets, maybe the less easy it is for
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma dismata to dilate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people looking at
the callous deposition, and we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some measurements for them on what
callous does to the material properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because callous accumulation, maybe you
know better than I do, callous
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation around plasma dismata can
really restrict also their dilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a question that sometimes we get
asked, and I don't have a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: answer for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the only way to look would
be to ask whether some plastic movement is
[SPEAKER_00]: different when you have the PME induction
versus the PMEI, but we haven't done it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
