[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be back again after almost a
year away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This morning, I'll be sharing some of the
highlights of the work that I've done as a
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD student over the last six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be covering three different projects
that are fairly unrelated, the first two
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little more depth than the last one
just very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I'll be talking about the
progress that we've done to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumbers with resistance to downy mildew,
which is the most widespread and
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating disease on cucumbers in the US
and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll be sharing some of the work
we've done to map the major powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, locust and squash,
which is one of the most widely used genes
[SPEAKER_00]: in squash breeding, but which to date
didn't have any markers available for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I'll briefly talk about a
collaborative effort we've been doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA to develop some genomic resources
for an important USDA pea core collection
[SPEAKER_00]: that's used by pea breeders not only in
North America, but around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I'll talk about the work
we've done in cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got involved in this project from
day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project was started in response
to an urgent need from the cucumber
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to solve a new disease crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say new, not because downy mildew is
new in cucumbers, because it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: around since the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for many decades, growers had never
really had to worry about downy mildew at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in large part thanks to the
efforts of breeders here at Cornell and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin and Clemson and some other
places at really developing robust disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance packages in cucumber,
including to downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that all came crashing down right
around 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from this headline in the
American Vegetable Grower Magazine,
[SPEAKER_00]: an old enemy re-emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, growers were seeing what to many
of them was almost a new disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many were not really sure what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it came in a very quick and dramatic
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you can see some of the symptoms
of downy mildew on cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downy mildew, you'll often see downy
mildew first characterized by very angular
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorotic lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a foliar disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see it on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those chlorotic areas eventually
coalesce and turn necrotic until you have
[SPEAKER_00]: total plant death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time that you first see a
chlorotic lesion on one leaf of a plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: the time it's completely dead and crispy
can be as little as three weeks without
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens really, really, really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2006 alone, it just caused
devastating production losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual states were reporting losses in
tens of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty big deal considering
the total production value in the US is
[SPEAKER_00]: around $350 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another reason this was such a bad
disease was that downy mildew is aerially
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersed by asexual zoospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oomycete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can travel for hundreds of miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a three-week span that your plant is
dying, the pathogen can reproduce from an
[SPEAKER_00]: initial spore landing to producing
millions of spores in 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can travel in nearby plants,
nearby farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the wind is right, hundreds or even
thousands of miles away in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a pathogen that overwinners
in cold places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will overwinter in southern Florida
where they don't have a frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it marches up the coast as spring
temperatures get warmer, which also
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to coincide when people are
planting their cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 90% of cucumber production is in
eastern states in kind of this area where
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea, all of these
green and blue spots are areas that at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time or another throughout the season
reported downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just the areas where it's
reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much you can fill in that whole map
in the eastern US of where the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for 90% of production in eastern
states, pickling cucumbers, Michigan is a
[SPEAKER_00]: big place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for slicers, Florida, Georgia,
and North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these places get downy mildew extremely
early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the North Atlantic area in the Great
Lakes, region where we are, we also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-two punch not only from disease coming
up from the south, but also from
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and hothouses that have
cucumber production all year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really no escaping this
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cucumbers, you will have downy
mildew on your cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not surprisingly, in 2008 there was a
survey from basically everybody involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cucumber industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions was, what can
public research institutions do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, downy mildew
research was ranked the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to develop resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to develop forecasting protocols,
anything related to downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in response to that, we started a
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we had to figure out was,
is there any sort of acceptable resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: out there right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the year before I joined,
so I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take credit for this, but Michael
and company started this effort with
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at USDA accessions, looking at
heirlooms, going back into the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bulbs, pulling out old lines that at
one time were reported to have downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance, and just growing really
as many things as we could with as many
[SPEAKER_00]: tips and as much data as we could dig up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that there were no
cultivars that had what would even
[SPEAKER_00]: approach acceptable levels of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did find a few old varieties,
heirlooms, and some of the lines that had
[SPEAKER_00]: been developed at Cornell in the past that
had more resistance than none.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might hold on a week, two weeks,
three weeks longer than the most
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that was the point where we
were going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to start crossing some of
those together and see if we could develop
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with superior resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as early as 2010, we had great
promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an F2 population of a cross
between two of those moderately resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most things out in the field were
dead, but every once in a while we came
[SPEAKER_00]: across a plant that looked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this season, we weren't to a point
yet where we had great resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything died by the end of the season,
but you can clearly see there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we grew out the parents,
individuals did much better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, which indicated to us that we
were actually combining genes from these
[SPEAKER_00]: various sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our general breeding strategy from that
point forward was basically to plant large
[SPEAKER_00]: populations into heavy pathogen pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this area, the downy mildew pathogen,
I should say, comes in late July,
[SPEAKER_00]: early August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we wanted to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to plant young plants in the
field so that when we were doing disease
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings, we didn't have to worry about any
complicating effects from natural plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant was turning necrotic,
dying, we knew it was from downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested fruit regularly so that we
didn't have any fruit load effects
[SPEAKER_00]: compounding resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We piled them by the plant so that we
could get a rough plant by plant yield
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would flag early selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had harsh selection intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the program,
the pathogen really did all the work for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't many things alive at the end
of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increased the frequency of
resistance alleles in our population,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to the point where everything was
surviving to the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we continued to select the best of the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did all phenotypic selection and
found that the downy mildew resistance was
[SPEAKER_00]: highly heritable and that our phenotypic
values were very predictive of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding value and the performance of the
lines in future years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was simply no time for pollinations
in the field before frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would take cuttings from the field
and bring them into the greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance the generations, which was very
easily done with cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just slice off a growing tip,
stick it in some media, make sure it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: warm and moist, and you can have 90%
rooting or even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first we did a pedigree selection
approach, as is very common in cucumber
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs, but then added a
recurrent selection approach with some
[SPEAKER_00]: intermating in the greenhouse,
which we needed to capture and retain all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the resistance alleles that we were
bringing in together because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: just too many to capture with moderate
size populations in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 2012, we had some lines that we were
ready to trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up top is DMR NY 264, which was our top
breeding line, and below it are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 264 stayed green all the way till
frost, produced fruit all the way till
[SPEAKER_00]: frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that it was doing better
than its parents, which would eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: die in the course of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this compared with one of our
susceptible checks, Piccolino,
[SPEAKER_00]: which died almost right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very typical of a lot of
cultivars that growers were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just whisper the words downy mildew
and they wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is 264 again with two cultivars that
were identified in the late 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some folks in North Carolina did some
trials to figure out, was there any
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: They included over 80 cultivars that
growers were commonly using at the time or
[SPEAKER_00]: were historically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two made it to the top of the
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the most resistant single-year
multi-state cultivar, and this was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most resistant multi-year multi-state
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, they're not very good
to really highlight that there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: options for growers at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say in the trial,
these were not reported to be very good
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just the best of the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: They acknowledged that, yeah, these aren't
very good, but they might survive a week
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did another study looking at all the
USDA accessions, and there was one that
[SPEAKER_00]: stood out, this PI197088, that we also
included in our trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it held up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had very similar levels of resistance
to some of our top lines, but resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: is about the only thing you can say for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild accession that was collected
in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, nobody really eats it or
would want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this very netted, hollow,
bitter fruit that is on a plant that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sticky sap and is highly male and
is late to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a lot of really negative
agronomic and horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that we didn't have to
deal with by not using it right out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing we were really interested in
is do we have high enough level of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to reduce or even avoid the use
of fungicides, because this was a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: deal for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a case example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan grows 30,000 acres of cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers collectively were spending $6.4
million a year on fungicide on cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that was for fungicides for downy
mildew on cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was costing growers up to $600 an
acre, which was completely eliminating the
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really had no choice on the
fungicides they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because downy mildew had overcome so many
fungicides, they were forced to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest and greatest, most expensive and
because it reproduces so quickly and is so
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent, they were spraying on a weekly
basis and spraying even before the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen came into the area, because once
you see it, it's game over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with fungicides, they were
gaining, or they are, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides are still important,
they gain some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often it is enough time to get a
harvest, but growers really want something
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant that they can add to their
fungicide programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we did a split plot
trial where we had four cultagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two cultivars, a slicer and a
pickler that are very common in
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had two of our breeding lines,
including 264, which was our top line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the plots, we had a no treatment
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't spray fungicide at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one, we used what is a
standard grower application of fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sprayed weekly, alternated between
two of the most effective fungicides at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, not surprisingly,
was this is a measure of area under
[SPEAKER_00]: disease progress curve, a measure of total
amount of disease that the plants have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher numbers are worse, you want a
lower number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any sort of treatment,
Dasher 2 and Eureka died pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They accumulated a lot of disease very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still saw some effect of using
fungicide with our lines, but this top
[SPEAKER_00]: line was statistically not different
between the fungicide and no fungicide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, which indicated to us that
growers could use this line in areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate pressure, could use this line
without fungicide or with reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a really significant finding
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we released this line, and it was
immediately picked up by a small seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company in the south where it really
gained traction because of the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pressure there and the lack of any
time at all to grow cucumbers before the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease moves into the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still had some flaws that we needed
to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to improve earliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were about 10 to 15, 264 is about 10 to
15 days later than commercial cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: which with cucumbers, when you're talking
about a crop that usually starts producing
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit in about 55 days, that's pretty
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to improve yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the male flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a little bit skewed ratio that we
wanted to change and improve the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 264 really was a slicer in a pickler's
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a small four to six inch fruit,
but had the skin of a slicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started crossing, went back to
crossing 264 with some elite lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the same approach that I
described earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of last year, we had some new lines
that we again trialed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is courtesy of Lauren,
who I worked with last year to set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she took all this data after I had
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our most promising line, 401,
did extremely well in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of it that we took.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a publication, we now have an eight to
10 inch fruit, as opposed to five to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a similar disease resistance in
this first column as 264, and much better
[SPEAKER_00]: than everything else we compared it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should point out that this SV line,
Darlington and Centella, are cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been released by seed companies
with purported downy mildew tolerance or
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to compare our material with
what was considered the best on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was really no comparison for the
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit under disease pressure was much
higher than everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it was bigger fruit,
not only more, but bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And days to harvest was right where we
wanted it to be, right in line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other commercial cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the plants growing
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our two lines here, the Markmore 97,
which kind of represents this B group
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and then straight A, which is
another very susceptible variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: was completely dead at the time all these
pictures were taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we released 401 and look forward to it
being trialed by seed companies as a line
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sold by itself or in a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one question I get a lot is how
durable do you think the resistance is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard question to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some anxiety about any new line
that is produced because this is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty pathogen in terms of its ability to
mutate and overcome plant host resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop resistance to fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a couple articles that have
been released since this new strain came
[SPEAKER_00]: on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing new avenues for pseudopornospora
cubensis, the pathogen, to mutate,
[SPEAKER_00]: change, and cause infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mostly the pathogen is spread via
asexual zoospores, but a new mating type
[SPEAKER_00]: has been found in the US, which could open
the door for sexual reproduction and
[SPEAKER_00]: recombination that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different populations of the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of genetic variability out
there, which if it starts recombining
[SPEAKER_00]: could be very problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now found evidence of seed
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is extremely important because
before we could predict where it was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be based on wind currents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it just depends on where seed is
moving potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's been some new hosts
discovered that might actually allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen to overwinter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a problem that we still have to
work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the great things about the
lines that we've developed is that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really a combination of resistance genes
from different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's more than can be easily
determined by segregation ratios in family
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know how many it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's my hope that it's enough that if
we keep working on this, we can stay ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next steps obviously are to
continue trialing these lines in numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, development of more commercial
cultivars with Cornell material in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to incorporate resistance into
other market types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pickling sector is actually larger
than the slicing cucumber sector in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also desperate for some downy
mildew resistant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's one thing that Lauren is
working on that you might hear about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue to improve resistance
maybe by identifying new sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, such as 197.088.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have different resistance genes
that could be combined with the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes to really produce almost
immunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on how many genes are
involved, the development of markers in
[SPEAKER_00]: either a marker system selection or even a
genomic selection approach could help us
[SPEAKER_00]: more easily move these genes into new
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to switch gears a little bit
and talk about the work we've done to map
[SPEAKER_00]: the powdery mildew resistance gene,
PM0 in cucurbita.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cucurbita is the genus of squash and
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, a look at the disease, powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So powdery mildew is a disease that can
occur on a lot of very taxonomically
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease is caused by a number of
different pathogens all from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're dealing with a fungal disease
instead of an oomycete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pretty common symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll range depending on the pathogen and
the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes you'll see these white
fuzzy spots on leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is a foliar pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fuzzy spots are the signs of the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the colonies of canidiophores,
which are the reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, these colonies will coalesce
so that you have a fuzzy mat on the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf surface and potentially the lower
leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the course of infection,
you can often get chlorotic areas at the
[SPEAKER_00]: point or nearby the colonies, which is a
sign of the pathogen using the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the most prevalent disease on
squash and pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the downy mildew pathogen,
it's dispersed aerially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty much everywhere that squash
and pumpkins are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike downy mildew, it typically results
in slow plant death, but can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce fruit quantity, quality,
and storability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the number one disease that
squash and pumpkin growers are asking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So powdery mildew can occur on all of the
cultivated species that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to introduce them
because you'll hear me talking about these
[SPEAKER_00]: different species a little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the species that is common in
the US is cucurbit of peepo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes your jack-o'-lantern
pumpkins, your spaghetti squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: acorn squash, zucchini, summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's cucurbit of moshata,
which includes your butternuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes your cheese type pumpkins,
and also processing type pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Dickinson variety among
others that are typically used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: canned pumpkin pie filling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's cucurbit of maxima,
which includes the buttercup types and
[SPEAKER_00]: your giant award-winning pumpkins modeled
by Chris and Kyle right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going for a number that beats that
this year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, most squash and pumpkins
are produced in eastern states.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 80% of the production is east of the
Mississippi River and a production value
[SPEAKER_00]: of about $330.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine, this is such an
important disease in squash and pumpkins
[SPEAKER_00]: that breeders and geneticists have been
looking for a long time for sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's no known native
resistance in cucurbit of peepo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the early 1970s, some researchers
grew out the whole USDA collection of all
[SPEAKER_00]: three of these species and found nothing
that even approached acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found some moderate resistance in
both cucurbit of moshata and maxima,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't really robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't what would even approach what
was desired by the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is known to be powdery
mildew resistance in several wild cucurbit
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the cucurbit species
shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a crossing polygon showing what
things are sparingly compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A line doesn't mean it's readily
compatible, but it means that if you work
[SPEAKER_00]: hard enough at it and long enough,
you can often get a few seeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these species, cucurbit of
ochochobiensis here, is resistant and was
[SPEAKER_00]: collected in Mexico a long time ago and
sent to Cornell with the hope that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be crossed with moshata and peepo to
bring resistance in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was ultimately very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a lot of effort, resistance was
transferred from this wild gourd-like
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to cucurbit of moshata and then
eventually into cucurbit of peepo through
[SPEAKER_00]: a moshata bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needed a little help there,
but they made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't complete resistance that was
transferred because we've never seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew on this plant in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cucurbit of moshata and peepo,
we don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that a single
gene was transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know that this has many genes that
contribute, but a very important gene was
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred, PM0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gene confers enough resistance
that growers often need reduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers use reduced fungicide
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a moderate year of pathogen
pressure, don't need any at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's adequate to get them to the end of
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the single gene was confirmed back in
the 1970s using segregating populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there at Cornell, this gene was
transferred into a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was transferred into both subspecies of
cucurbit of peepo into pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these varieties are all names of
varieties developed at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: into zucchini, including Romulus here,
which has been the source of resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of the things we've done
historically in the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was transferred into the other
subspecies of cucurbit of peepo into
[SPEAKER_00]: straight neck squash and acorn and
delicata.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was moved into different butternuts in
cucurbit of moshata, a large butternut and
[SPEAKER_00]: a smaller butternut bugle, which is,
you can find in a number of seed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one interesting cultivar that lost
resistance, it was transferred into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbit of peepo, cocuzelli, which is
kind of like a zucchini, but later we
[SPEAKER_00]: found lost the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be important in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from here, these were disseminated to
seed companies that use these as sources
[SPEAKER_00]: of the PM0 gene, use these or their
progenitors as we shared, as the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: program shared along the way, and continue
to be extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much every variety that is powdery
mildew resistant today has its roots in
[SPEAKER_00]: these efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has the PM0 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly widely used gene,
but a problem to date is that there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: markers for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons for that is a lot
of the squash and pumpkin breeding efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: are done by small to medium sized
companies that just don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources for mapping and market
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually we have, many of you might
know that we host the Vegetable Breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute field days every year,
where seed company representatives will
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and see the resources that the
Cornell breeding programs have developed
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of pitch their ideas on what they
want to see in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite things to ask them
every year was, if you could pick one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for a public research institution to
develop that would have utility for your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And without fail, every year for squash,
the two answers were markers for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance and markers for virus
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a huge need that we wanted to
solve right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we map this gene quickly without
developing new populations, without
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting additional seasons, and using the
germplasm that we already have available?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have what we termed a shared trait
integration panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were things that were very diverse in
very different species, subspecies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and market classes, but they all had one
thing in common, and that was a single
[SPEAKER_00]: gene from a wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do was we sequenced
Cucurbita ocochobiansis subspecies
[SPEAKER_00]: martinisii, the original source of the PM0
gene, using genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also got together a bunch of
heirloom varieties in Cucurbita people and
[SPEAKER_00]: one in Cucurbita moshata, things that were
around before the introgression event took
[SPEAKER_00]: place, things that had no chance of having
any of the wild species in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we genotyped these also with GBS,
and then we filtered all of the markers so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we only kept the set that had one
allele for martinisii and one allele for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the heirlooms together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sequenced quite a large number
of heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we anchored all of these markers using
an F2 population that was being grown at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time the study was done at Rupseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we partnered with them on this project,
and they shared some of their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an inner-specific population,
so it was really great for developing lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we genotyped the Cornell
shared introgression panel that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to earlier, all of these inbred
lines, inbred cultivars, that were diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: but shared something in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these bars represents a
chromosome from 1 to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at whether they had the
heirloom allele or whether they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: martinisii or ochochobiensis allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gray is heirloom, and blue is
martinisii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the chunk of cucuritum
martinisii just lights right up,
[SPEAKER_00]: right on linkage group 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty confident that we had
found something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we zoomed in on the region,
so this is a zoomed-in pictograph,
[SPEAKER_00]: on linkage group 10, once again we have
the wild species up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that there was some recombination
around the area, not surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember me talking about the line
that had resistance that lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had part of the martinisii
introgression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't have the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these up here had resistance,
so we were able to use that to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively small 500 kilobase region that
we were pretty confident had the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be somewhere in here,
because these had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it couldn't be here, because this one
didn't have the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we had this interval, we followed
up with a pretty small GWAS study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's only so many cultivars that
are out there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since the first cultivars
started appearing in the late 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found about 81 cucuritupipo
cultivars, many with the PM0 resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: both subspecies and all morphotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have the Texana subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the pipo subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had pumpkins, zucchini,
acorns, delicata, anything that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: find, any market type that had the
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: gene and where we had heirlooms that
lacked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them all out in the field in
replicated plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used petiole ratings as our
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we've learned over many
years is that petiole ratings are the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest way to determine if something is
carrying the PM0 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves can vary a little bit, but almost
invariably, something that is homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: for the resistance allele will not have
any colonies on its petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is homozygous for the
susceptibility allele will be just
[SPEAKER_00]: covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually something of heterozygous will
have colonies at its base and taper off,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tips will be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we added two other classes just
to be able to represent some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate phenotypes that we saw in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: On linkage group 10, right over the
interval, we had our peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you not familiar with
these types of plots, this is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: Manhattan plot where the linkage groups
are on the bottom and the negative log of
[SPEAKER_00]: the P value, which represents the
significance of the allele relating to the
[SPEAKER_00]: trait or the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had very significant hit right
at the interval where we assumed the locus
[SPEAKER_00]: was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one more confirmation, we teamed up
with Rupp again, who did a simple binary
[SPEAKER_00]: rating on their F2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the same F2 that we used to
anchor our SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took four markers, these two inside
the interval and these two flanking the
[SPEAKER_00]: interval to see if they used a different
accession of Okeechobeensis if the PM0
[SPEAKER_00]: gene was in that one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is very much what we
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an additive or incompletely
dominant gene action here where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the group of plants that were
homozygous for the susceptibility alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: had higher disease ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that were homozygous for the
resistance allele had statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant lower ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we moved outside of that interval,
the difference in PM scores was reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some fine mapping and narrowed
that 500 kb region to about a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 80 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a number of interesting
candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've highlighted four of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a predicted peroxidase,
which is known to contribute to powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance in barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the salicylic acid binding
protein, which contributes to powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance in arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I think is particularly
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an NBS LRR that is a powdery
mildew resistance protein in arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then zinc finger, there's a zinc
finger protein here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are involved in a lot of
biotrophic pathogen resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be any number of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is as far as we are at to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It presents a lot of interesting questions
moving forward for someone to follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely don't rule out the
possibility that's a number of these genes
[SPEAKER_00]: acting in tandem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be multiple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the case of the R gene, it's a very
big R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's actually a raft of R genes
connected to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the last thing we did, and this
credit goes to Kyle, was to take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our markers and take some of the SNPs and
develop markers into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We released the sequence information so
that those can be adapted to any platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that the breeders want and ran some caps
here where we had perfect segregation
[SPEAKER_00]: between the phenotype and the marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next steps, evaluate candidates to
identify the causal gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll be a very interesting
exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue to improve powdery
mildew resistance in commercial cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't directly related to what I was
talking about, but it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the PM0 gene doesn't confer
immunity into the tolerant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been more reports in recent
years that the resistance isn't holding up
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as it had in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not at all surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a single gene
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, that's going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be on top of finding other
sources of resistance, using recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: selection approaches to combine these
small effect alleles that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: natively in cucurbitipipo or especially
cucurbitimoshata.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also revisit some of these wild
species to pick up the genes that were
[SPEAKER_00]: left behind in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot more tools and
technologies now to do that than they had
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really briefly, I'm going to talk about
a collaborative effort with the USDA on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some genetic characterization of
what we term the USDA Pisome Diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: Collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this collection really has its roots
in a core collection developed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 1990s that was assembled to maximize
geographical and morphological diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: within the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accessions were collected all around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map shows the 238 accessions of
the UPDC, as we call it, that were
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's almost 200 accessions
that were developed by breeding programs
[SPEAKER_00]: or donated by institutions but have
unknown collection origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing in particular to note is
that this collection includes breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: material from the USDA and Washington
State breeding programs and field peas and
[SPEAKER_00]: snap peas developed by Jim Myers and his
predecessors at Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should say that this collection is
used widely by pea breeders to find new
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the collection has been grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The core collection and its derivatives,
including the UPDC, have been grown out in
[SPEAKER_00]: various permutations many times by
breeders looking for new traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of phenotypes that
have been recorded and are publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big thing that was missing was any
sort of high density molecular data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was needed to be able to map
those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the traits that are important in
pea are single gene traits that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively simple to map with enough
markers and enough individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype data is already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing we wanted to do was be
able to get a genetic snapshot of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection looked like.
Oftentimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypes could look similar,
but they could be very genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would help us to tease out where
diversity is for breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things we did was look
at the structure of the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have a principal components
diagram showing each one of these dots
[SPEAKER_00]: represents an accession that was
genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the Oregon State snap peas,
snap and snow peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the Washington State field peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these other colors were used
based on previous studies that included
[SPEAKER_00]: these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study, or this color here,
yellow, represents the cultivated type
[SPEAKER_00]: pea, Pysum sativum subspecies sativum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, in blue, are the two recognized
subspecies of Pysum sativum, Elatius and
[SPEAKER_00]: Abyssinicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is perhaps the most interesting
is this area of green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these peas here come from Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, all of these do, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were just the ones that were
included in previous studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not recognized as a separate
subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have noticed that peas from
Central Asia seem to be different than
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one has really looked too much into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we were interested in
doing with the genetic data is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we could uncover anything about
this very different group of peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be said that these peas are
often found in mountainous regions in
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think of the mountainous areas
in Iran and Afghanistan, India and Nepal,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to be more cold tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be low growing, basal
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of phenotypic
differences, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we had, and which
hasn't really been addressed is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it possible that these accessions had
some ancient or maybe more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: introgression from Pysum fulvum,
which is the only other sister species of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pysum sativum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to the USDA collection and
genotyped with GBS some Pysum fulvums to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if they clustered nearby these Central
Asian peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are included at red at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons we thought they
might was because there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there still is work that needs to be
done to figure out where do these peas
[SPEAKER_00]: come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these peas have a lot of genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at how much diversity they have
to offer to breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the left, we have each group,
Pysum fulvum, the subspecies elatius,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivated types, the sativum,
and the Central Asian peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at how many snips they have
that are unique to each of those groups
[SPEAKER_00]: versus these groups here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found, and we corrected for
different population sizes within each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these groups, we found that the Central
Asian peas had over 6,000 snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is out of around 6,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 58,000 snips total that were
different than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we compared that to the breeding
program peas, Washington state and Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: state, we found that they actually had
more unique alleles than even the Pysum
[SPEAKER_00]: fulvum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one very important key here is that
these Central Asian peas have not really
[SPEAKER_00]: been used in breeding efforts,
as far as I know, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are fully compatible with
cultivated sativums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Pysum fulvum is a different
species, and there's a lot of crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers that exist there to bring in that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, we've developed the
first slicing cucumber with high
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to a new strain of downy
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have resistance genes in very diverse,
moderately resistant material that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: can be combined to provide high levels of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: With resistance, we can reduce or
eliminate the need for fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that this shared trait
integration panel mapping approach is very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, and we think it can be used a
lot in vegetable crops where this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: model of bringing in a single gene from
wild species is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of disease resistance
genes that have been introduced from a
[SPEAKER_00]: single wild species, and we think this
approach could really illuminate those in
[SPEAKER_00]: short order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have markers for PM0, which is the
most widely used gene in squash and
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkin breeding, and which a lot of seed
companies have already started
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing into their breeding
pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a high density SNP dataset that's
now available for genetic characterization
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully trait mapping in a very
diverse collection of pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're particularly interested in the
application of this data to use this group
[SPEAKER_00]: of peas from Central Asia for bringing in
additional diversity to breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of people to acknowledge
for all of these different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say special thanks to my
graduate committee, Michael and Mike Gore
[SPEAKER_00]: and Susan and Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tremendously supportive
throughout the time I've been here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been able to bounce a lot of
ideas off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to all the current and
former members of the Missouri Lab Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were figuring things out,
we really helped each other with various
[SPEAKER_00]: skills and expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a list of co-authors who have
been very instrumental in all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cucumber, squash, and pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cornell farm and greenhouse research
teams can't get enough thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they do to keep things going
throughout the year and the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Kreidinger at the Vegetable Breeding
Institute has been very helpful all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, has answered a lot of questions over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first got started in genotyping,
Sharon Mitchell and Charlotte Charia spent
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of time helping us get going in
those directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some collaborators at other
institutions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yishun and John Murphy and Rupseeds that
donated seeds or resources along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks in large part to all of
the funding that allowed us to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
