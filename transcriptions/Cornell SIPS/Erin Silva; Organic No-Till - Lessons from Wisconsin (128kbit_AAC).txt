[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Matt said, I'm a professor at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with organic agriculture
for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started my career down in
Mexico State University and really struck
[SPEAKER_01]: me the role of organic in terms of
building regenerative ag systems and
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing many of the challenges we face
not only as a nation but globally in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of having a healthy nutritious food
supply, supporting farmers, supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: small family farmers, supporting community
farmers, and supporting soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic is all about soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about building our soil,
improving our soil resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is the first regenerative
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we look at maintaining and
forwarding organic practices, it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: grounded in regenerative ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working in organic no-till
since that first time in New Mexico
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how we can create systems that
can help preserve our soil, build our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been over 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a lot in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting to continue to do the
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Matt said, a lot of the research that
we have been doing is in partnership with
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell University here in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you that don't know
Wisconsin, tends to be considered a
[SPEAKER_01]: Wyoming state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many of you are familiar
with Wisconsin versus the Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of similarities to the
agriculture in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hillier landscapes, a lot of
organic farmers and farming places,
[SPEAKER_01]: valleys, a very diverse agriculture,
smaller farms, and we have organic dairy,
[SPEAKER_01]: some organic vegetables, organic grape
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And New York and Wisconsin always tend to
be competing for that second place or
[SPEAKER_01]: first place position in terms of number of
organic farms, the number of dollars from
[SPEAKER_01]: organic grain and dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always jockeying for that leadership
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about California if we
don't count.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Wisconsin and New York are really
super close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a difference in how you would
be presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really relevant to New York
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Matt and his team are certainly in
contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can talk about how the market goes
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest difference in
Wisconsin is we're not farming rocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our soil is the only way we know how
many rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the size of our resources
we have, and even in our notes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give credit to this present
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually made by our research
scientist, Ben Rocko.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super grateful to Ben for all the work
he's done with data analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give him a huge amount of
credit for pulling this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with organic no-till soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to stress as well,
a lot of my work is in organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has a really strong place as we
look forward not only to organic grains,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have other organic seeds in
livestock production as well as organic
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly am not promoting organic
no-till as the silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many, many long-term studies
that have compared organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, organic truly is the
first regenerative agriculture even with
[SPEAKER_01]: judicious tillage that integration across
diversity and cover crops, organic farms
[SPEAKER_01]: still are building soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to demonize tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a place for tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think organic tillage is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can have very, very good
organic farms that are stewarding the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: with tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all tillage is part of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic no-till should be considered
as part of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at designing rotations
and how we build these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ecological tools together to create a
system that we can lower inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be building nitrogen on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be lowering our need for different
insecticides or other assets even with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about building the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about organic no-till as part of
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I first started working in organic
no-till soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been about 20 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the opportunity to work with
Jeff Moyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned a lot from the Rodale
Institute and what they have been doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of pioneering this technique over
the past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a lot of success in the
organic soybean system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say we haven't dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anything in organic can be
dialed in for the ecological nature of the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a system that's workable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have more and more examples of
farms that are making this work as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: their soybean approach on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at market opportunities in
terms of organic grains, we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: importing the majority of organic
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we just talked about
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic farms aren't really about organic
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a sector of the organic grain
market that there is opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is opportunity for more domestic
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at these different tools to
make organic soybean production more
[SPEAKER_01]: feasible, is also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the system with organic no-till
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first step is rye establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we typically are using a winter annual
cereal grain as the tool for weed
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter annual rye tends to be the most
consistent performer in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter annual cereal grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It overwinters well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tends to, I think, impose a bit more
ideal cap in the system that can also help
[SPEAKER_01]: with weed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key aspects of this system is
this planting date for winter rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we see how this system has failed
on farms, where farmers are seeing issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes it is tied to this first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at that first step rye,
the system is going to have a high risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first step of planting that rye on
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In San Antonio, New York, I wouldn't push
it past mid-September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really requires to be successful
at redesigning the system more broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes in Wisconsin, organic grain
farmers are planting soybeans after corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could get a rye planting date of
mid-September if you're coming in after
[SPEAKER_01]: corn silage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, to get that really planting
date, you need to think about redesigning
[SPEAKER_01]: the system, including winter annual rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are cereal grains, other winter
annual cereal grains, and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: something that can be harvested so that
people can target.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mid-September planting date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two other keys in terms of what to look
for to make this system successful at this
[SPEAKER_01]: early step is to go into a field that has
the right weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a cleanup method in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a way that we can clean up
weed fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also is not the best method for
suppressing perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thistle, quack rafts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So targeting which fields you're going to
try for organic no-till and choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: fields that don't have excessively high
weed pressure and that aren't struggling
[SPEAKER_01]: with perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of this first step that is
key is the seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not using a seeding rate for a
typical rye cover crop coming in after
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, which is maybe a bushel,
bushel and a half per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to bump this up to get the ground
cover and biomass needed to suppress
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually around the three bushel an acre
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So investing in that higher seeding rate
is going to pay off in terms of weeds as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three key aspects of this early step
that's going to set you up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rye of winter starts to grow again in
June and May, and we want to terminate
[SPEAKER_01]: after the stage manatee season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see where the flowers are
coming off of the rye heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run your hand across the rye heads
and see the yellow pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you're rolling,
there's clouds of pollen that will come
[SPEAKER_01]: off the track when driving over the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard stories of it actually
clogging the track there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stage we're targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into early, you're not going to be
able to get the mechanical termination of
[SPEAKER_01]: rye that's going to predict that rye map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into late, you're going to
potentially have issues with viable rye
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, which especially is an issue if
you're growing other cereal grains within
[SPEAKER_01]: the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you have great grains that
are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard of feed-grade grains having
issues with some of that viable rye seed
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen contamination in that cereal
ready-based cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, the stage in visas or the
seed note of the rye flower heads,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to occur on Memorial Day,
June 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're targeting for the
candle termination of the rye at the
[SPEAKER_01]: planting date of soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not in a common photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a photo of our research field at
Arlington, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So South Central, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rye map does an excellent job
suppressing weeds, so we don't have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through a due cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rye takes care of the bean management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can roll the rye, plant it,
and then let it go for the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then harvest in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: This system does push back maturity,
so it does require to be ready to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: in late October, early November.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to reach the price stage of
soybean journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different sorts of roller farmers we've
tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried the Rodeo model, which many of
you may have seen and associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a model that is manufactured by a
more local machine manufacturer in South
[SPEAKER_01]: Central, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lots of different options in terms of
roller farmers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen a huge difference in terms
of performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's been options then that
weren't ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why organic no-till?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something as we're seeing more
extreme weather, seeing more heavy rain
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important as a mitigation tool for
soil loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the upper Midwest, in the Corn Belt,
on average we lost a third of our topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that topsoil is very, very difficult
to regain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly can build soil organic matter
within organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to regain this degree of topsoil will
take decades if not centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an important resource that we need
to be very aware in terms of how our
[SPEAKER_01]: management is affecting the maintenance of
that resource and how it comes effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some pictures that we've seen
in terms of topsoil loss versus recent
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy rain events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see with that soil cover how that
surface erosion of the soil versus if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have that dry mat, how that protects and
mitigates impacts of those heavy rains,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps that soil in place, and also helps
maintain soil moisture throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season by essentially acting as a
barrier to evaporation and cooling the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other examples within our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the open ground, the seed where
there's visible signs of erosion versus in
[SPEAKER_01]: organic no-till where you have that soil
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the seed treatment side by
side and how that soil is actually washing
[SPEAKER_01]: and being stopped by the organic no-till
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does also help in the labor
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the organic farms I've worked
with that utilize this technique,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's often not all their organic soybean
acres but some of their organic soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: acres because it helps spread out the
labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in seasons like this past
season in Wisconsin where just we were
[SPEAKER_01]: hammered with rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to find those windows where you can get
out and cultivate was near impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having a certain degree of acres
that you don't have to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_01]: it allows you to more effectively manage
those acres that you do need to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a typical tillage-based system in
Wisconsin, we typically have two to three,
[SPEAKER_01]: three plant tillage passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then up to three to five, we manage
the passes after planting with our wine
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, time eating, rotary sowing,
and our row cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ever crop mulch system, this organic
no-till system, basically cuts out all
[SPEAKER_01]: that before pre-plant tillage as well as
those plant tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of trips off across the field,
and this is where a lot of the economics
[SPEAKER_01]: payoff is less labor, less wear and tear
on your equipment, less passes over the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, so less fuel costs, and ultimately
think about mitigating friction by
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminating that degree of passes over the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also manage it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you'll look at the cost of the
system and how the economics pay off by
[SPEAKER_01]: having the labor and fuel costs reduce by
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely shows up in a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where, again, there's risk in a
system that I think when we look at how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually executed on farms,
to have it more diversified in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the approach and maybe not having all of
your acres of organic no-till is smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we see more unpredictable weather
patterns happening year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is over the past decade that we've
been doing organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing it longer, just showing
the last few years of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the yields, no-till per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green bars are no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue bars are tilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we're typically averaging
between 40 and 65, which is one acre in
[SPEAKER_01]: those two systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at this black line,
that is precipitation, the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall in inches that is perceived
during the growing season, you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: that when we have less rainfall,
where this bar is lower, that's when you
[SPEAKER_01]: see more of a difference between those two
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in years when we have sufficient
precipitation, like in 2024, we can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually exceed the yields of traditional
conventional organic soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have that weed management tool
in place, we're not struggling with
[SPEAKER_01]: getting out home-made during the wetter
weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a system where we can better
manage weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see when these black bars at
its high points, there's very little yield
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where the system breaks down and where
the risk is in those extremely dry years,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a rye essentially acts like a
straw and sucks up a lot of that soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, and planting into a dry
situation within the whole rye,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soybeans definitely struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having some acres in traditional
organic soybeans that are cultivated and
[SPEAKER_01]: some in organic no-till, you can kind of
buffer against some of this uncertainty in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of weather patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So profitability, looking at profitability
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some kind of battling envelope
numbers that have been put together
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing the organic no-till system to
some of the costs in terms of different
[SPEAKER_01]: field operations, as well as different
inputs in terms of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming that even in organic seed
operation, we're typically going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in some rye cover crop,
but at that lower seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of the fact that we can
field-cast at a lower variable cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in terms of seed costs and
some of the passes over the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can see that although there's tiny
margins, that if we can close that gap,
[SPEAKER_01]: that organic no-till can outperform
organic tillage-based systems with respect
[SPEAKER_01]: to the economics of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at where does that pay off?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get the yield within about five
bushels an acre, we typically see the
[SPEAKER_01]: economics of the system pay off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I've ended in this
summer, which was super exciting,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to see how the practices that we've
been researching at our research station
[SPEAKER_01]: actually translate onto farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often times when you're at a research
station and you're criticized and working
[SPEAKER_01]: in a little bit of a bubble, we might not
be seeing the realities of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in our organic farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that went out to organic farms that
were using organic no-till to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what farmers were doing with
organic no-till, what challenges that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers were facing with the
implementation of the system, and to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's any trends that we're seeing
across the farm sites that are using this
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did this across a local state area
in the outer Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at dry management, soybean
management, and the equipment that farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: were using, and collected a range of data
looking at sodium nutrients, biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat biomass, and soil standard yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he found, so farmers that were
using TPA went to about 14 farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So proceeding from, like I mentioned,
crop rotation is one of the trickier
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of the system of dial-in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to think of it as a system,
and what you're going to be planting
[SPEAKER_01]: before the soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he was finding was that most of the
farms were using some sort of cereal grain
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were harvesting as a hash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them were coming in following
winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley was another one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: In response, when we can get some really
high yielding corn crop, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for silage that we can get off
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: One farm was using corn silage as a
proceeding crop, and only one was using
[SPEAKER_01]: corn for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having these cereal grains as a
proceeding crop allowed for the farms that
[SPEAKER_01]: were using the system to get and hit that
early planting date for the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vast majority with this rotation
were hitting that early September planting
[SPEAKER_01]: date.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should probably remember pushing it
out further, but also they were also able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that high rise seeding rate to make
the system work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The varieties they were using,
Enki Gartner and Aroustiff, are both some
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier maturing varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So varieties that are a little bit more
adapted to the system, so they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: that earlier termination date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them were also applying the
newer before rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is also an important part
of the success, is having adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility for that rye crop crop to get
the biomass needed for wheat depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vast majority were treating that
rye as a crop and adding some fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them were planting before
cribbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this doesn't mean planting weeks
earlier before cribbing, but instead,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially going over the field twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going through the standing rye to plant
the soybeans, which helps facilitate the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed to soil contact because you're not
having to get a planter to do that thick
[SPEAKER_01]: rye mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then coming in and primping right
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple that were primping
first and trying to plant them at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority were primping first and
then primping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean planting date kind of rained in
that late latter part of May to the early
[SPEAKER_01]: part of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that were doing it mid-May probably
were using the technique where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting around the root stage of rye and
then letting the soybeans germinate and
[SPEAKER_01]: then primping over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean seeding rates, and this is
reflective of some really great research
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of Cornell, is that in this
system, going to the heavier soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: seeding rates is also important for the
success of the resilience of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been going up to about 204,000
seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them, most of them, were on their
new droves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them were on narrow row
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about half of them or more were doing
some in-seed and weed management to help
[SPEAKER_01]: manage some of the seeds in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the performance,
many of them were targeting, the vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority were targeting or being able to
achieve the rye biomass that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the system work, which is about 8,000
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having those earlier planting days,
that fertility, and that heavier rye
[SPEAKER_01]: seeding rate, those who were working in
their fager and they were getting the rye
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass seeding expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the farms were struggling with
weed suppression, as evidenced by this
[SPEAKER_01]: higher number, but most of them were
getting weeds that weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a range of different soybean stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of them were struggling a bit with
getting that good seed soil contact and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the soybean stem needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the soybean yields, 46 bushels an
acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can say another 3D soybean yield in
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farmers were having success in this
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers that were surveying,
the farmers that were visiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: were having success in terms of getting
the biomass, getting the weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting the soybean yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really exciting to see that a
system that we've been working so hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: research at Wisconsin and for now,
we're seeing in terms of success in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the photograph of the differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we can see a high biomass rye
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just what a difference having that
heavy rye biomass when you can't see any
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus inhaling the biomass and just how
many weeds are breaking through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So visual demonstration of how important
setting up a system for that high weight
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at the inconsistency of
the stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having this excellent swaying stand,
paying attention to planting, planter
[SPEAKER_01]: setup, paying attention to being able to
get that seeded ground versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistency of plant stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rye biomass, and this is something we
see in our research as well, was the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important predictor for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dialing in the system, choosing your
fields, getting the rye early,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that rye seed rate correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important aspect of having
this work on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increases in rye biomass tended to
decrease weed biomass, the rye biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased, soybean yield increased,
and the soybean yield was strongly
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated to weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this we see in the TILT system as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't get our weed management dialed
in, that's when our yields are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed biomass is dominated by a few
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are species that we struggle
with, the upper Midwest, giant grass weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: giant foxtail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a really persistent issue in
recent years for a lot of land-growing
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, the low and middle foxtail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planter setup, really key in this system
to make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean emergence is a challenge with
increasing rye biomass, so we need that
[SPEAKER_01]: rye biomass to get the weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does make planting a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we might see if we crib
first and don't have a plan set up and
[SPEAKER_01]: there are seeds that are resting on their
rye biomass, and those seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: not germinate and contribute to those poor
stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some setup considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do this, want to have
the ability to cut and navigate through
[SPEAKER_01]: the rye residue to open the furrow and
reduce that hair pinning where that rye is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially just pushed into the planting
row, has sufficient down pressure to push
[SPEAKER_01]: through the mulch layer and place the seed
in the appropriate depth, and we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the ability to close that seed
furrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done a lot of research with ag
engineer Brian Lott to see how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome these issues and look at
different down pressures, different
[SPEAKER_01]: seeding rates, still a little bit on the
low side, but a range of seeding rates as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as the different cultures and growing
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what we've seen, how that
translates in the field, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: to remind you that there's different
letters following the values.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that they're statistically
significantly different so that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: have confidence that, yes, these
treatments are having a effect on what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we saw was that, yeah, we're looking
at what to do with the soybean planting
[SPEAKER_01]: base to make this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bumping up your seeding rates will
translate into higher yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down pressure, we did see a numerical
difference, but not a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the down pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as a colder versus no colder
in this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the higher seeding rate is improving
plant stand and grain yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher down pressure and holding seems to
improve the plant stand, but it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: translate into yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some relationship between soybean emerges
and grain yields are research stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research stations in Arlington,
the research station in Arlington,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get really high biomass,
and that is, it's definitely a challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of getting the soybean
established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soybean convergence translated into
grain yields in these locations,
[SPEAKER_01]: right biomass is exceeding 10,000 pounds
per acre and lower soybean emergence,
[SPEAKER_01]: strong relationship with grain yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this indicates potentially that the
yield gap could be overcome by soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this polter-style matter is just some
of the research we were doing with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Locke looking at holding the waviness,
how that weighs seed placement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can plant stand to look at several
different polters, straight versus ripple
[SPEAKER_01]: versus 13-wave versus 8-wave versus no
colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found was that the results
differed for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the environmental conditions
that is going to affect the degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: difference you see with these different
polters.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2023 versus 2024, you can see 2023 was
an extremely dry year versus last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had more steady rain fall particularly
earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did find overall though was that
with the planters that are in this system,
[SPEAKER_01]: using straight edge polters was beneficial
in terms of being able to get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: single soil contact in the plant standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that care fitting was significantly
reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So setting up your planter release system
using straight edge polters is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found that the straight edge
polters were beneficial in terms of having
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced leaf pressure within that planting
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So straight edge polters have several
benefits over a single system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how this translates into brain yield,
we did not see any difference in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain yields, but in terms of,
again, the leaf suppression of the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn now for the rest of
my talk and talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research with reduced tilt corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, and again, we saw this translated
into the, with the on-farm study we did,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic no-tilk soybeans is definitely a
system that can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're planning how to plant the rye,
how do you design a rotation, getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: planter set up, dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic no-tilk soybeans are a viable and
profitable system for organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic reduced tilt corn is something
that I would say is not quite ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: prime time at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of exciting research,
a lot of exciting promise, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing more stories of farmers that are
seeing some degree of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone would want to try organic
no-tilk corn, I would recommend doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: on a very, very small scale, just see how
it works on your farm, two to 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is absolutely not something that
would do over a significant number of
[SPEAKER_01]: acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried a couple different approaches to
organic no-tilk corn, roller crimping and
[SPEAKER_01]: a living mulch system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So roller crimping or mirroring what we're
doing with the soybeans, using a winter
[SPEAKER_01]: annual cover crop planted in the fall and
terminating that mechanically in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living mulch systems, looking into using a
legume, whether it be bread clover or
[SPEAKER_01]: other clovers or alfalfa, and using
different ways of suppressing that living
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch, that legume that's been planted
previous years for the corn maize,
[SPEAKER_01]: and essentially managing that mulch to
limit competition with corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the roller crimp system,
we're typically using rye and gash,
[SPEAKER_01]: both winter annuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefits, these systems tend to be
more weed suppressive, so we get more of
[SPEAKER_01]: that weed control aspect of the system
that we're looking for, but the cover crop
[SPEAKER_01]: terminates, so we have a pattern,
we terminate this, and it will stay as a
[SPEAKER_01]: killed mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no competition with nutrients
in the water while the soybeans are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bech, if we can overwinter bech
consistently and get the vital amounts we
[SPEAKER_01]: need, bech can supply a significant amount
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen to the system, which is a
limiting factor in terms of corn
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity within these no-soil systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: High yield potential so far as evidenced
in our research trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit more consistent in terms of
the performance of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Risks, they do require later planting data
for the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rye can be a reservoir for, or a host for
armyworms, so there's more insect pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: within these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardiness of bech seed, so that seed can
have persistence across multiple seasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it does not germinate the first year of
planting, and if there's escapes in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bech seed, that can be persistent
in some sort of phase of the propagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and whereas the bech can produce a lot of
nitrogen, it's not necessarily available
[SPEAKER_01]: when the corn needs it, so that can be a
challenge as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The living mulch system, planting dates
are not as dependent, so potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not waiting for that stage of crop
maturity for the chemical germination,
[SPEAKER_01]: so flowering for both amnesia for rye as
well as flowering early plants at their
[SPEAKER_01]: bech, we can theoretically come in as
early as early May and plant into the
[SPEAKER_01]: living mulch systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Armyworms less of a concern, armyworms not
as attracted to legumes as it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: grasses, less hard seediness, have better
persistence and persistence in some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of crop phases, and then opportunity,
utilize our cover crops and forage,
[SPEAKER_01]: so when our dairy systems could be a very
attractive option as we raise or develop
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative forages, or even come in after
now fell to stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Risks, there's a lot more competition in
these systems because the cover crops are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually growing, not as much contribution
because that nitrogen is being fixed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the legume, it's being used by the legume
itself, more variability in yield in our
[SPEAKER_01]: weed control of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the yields that we've seen,
so we've been trying these from last years
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in the field, so we have a good
five or six years under our belt in these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the legumes we've used,
red clover and alfalfa, and yellow blossom
[SPEAKER_01]: weed clover, so this is where there's
promise, but there's still work to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done, so if you see the yields on that
y-axis, we can have yields as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in some years, in some systems,
we can see yields reaching 150 and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even closer to 180 in some of these
systems, so in certain spots in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there is evidence that there's
potential to these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can understand how to dial it in,
what we need in terms of reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: competition in management, I still hold
that there is a way to utilize these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems to reduce virgin corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roller and prick systems, kind of see
that similar variability in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryeberry veg next, we can see yields of
corn, they emerge about 60, both on acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 150, and even a little bit higher if
we're using just straight hairy veg as the
[SPEAKER_01]: roll from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, is this ready for on-farm adoption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure, but really looking forward,
continuing this research in partnership
[SPEAKER_01]: with farmers and cover crop breeders,
to see how can we make that yield of 150,
[SPEAKER_01]: 180, so some of our experiments,
I know I'm getting very, very close to
[SPEAKER_01]: time, looking at management tools and
management intensities of the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: so baseline, using pre-plant manure
applications, planting red clover in
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-August, we are doing different ways of
kind of strip-tilling, or modified
[SPEAKER_01]: strip-tilling, so trying to minimize
competition within the planting row form,
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting good stand establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things in the system that I
think we can also look at more closely is
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think genetic adaptation and genetic
activity systems are going to be key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just have that point out that
with that 150 foot of acre yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using very, very short season
varieties in form, so maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising that our yield potential is
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: For in-season management, looking at
fertility applications, at-planting,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure it's actually nitrogen,
and then some management of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, different tools we're using,
undercutters to make those rows,
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways of pressing through
flame-beading, roller-crimping,
[SPEAKER_01]: and finalizing cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just looking at some yield tree
systems, undercutting, and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: strip-tilling, or clearing a planting row
with the core, I think that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: key.
[SPEAKER_01]: These yields are in big amounts per
hectare, but you can see with the
[SPEAKER_01]: undercutting, we do see a significantly
higher yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flame-beading, we did see a trend towards
higher yields with the flame-beading as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that meets this project,
and we're looking at interrow-crimping,
[SPEAKER_01]: high-residue cultivation, seeing a less of
an impact on those tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did see trends towards
lower-planting and higher-residue
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, so risk of impacting the stay
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some newer research that I'll wrap
up with this, using a forage harvester to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage alfalfa, and using some other
strip-tilling tools as well as interrow
[SPEAKER_01]: mower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, crop management here, risk over seeded
in August, we do some forage harvests
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing that as a crop, as well as
mulch, strip-tilling in late May,
[SPEAKER_01]: planting that short-season corn,
doing some interrow mowing to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigating competition, and a couple
different stages of each form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we're finding here is that using
some of these competition mitigation
[SPEAKER_01]: tools, we are seeing some benefit to the
interrow mowing, looking at what the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential nitrogen competition is,
or nitrogen uptake of the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it does look like we can mitigate some
of that competition to be valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: both within the red clover and alfalfa
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at corn yields, so this is where,
particularly looking at the interrow mower
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way to help improve some of the corn
yields by mitigating that competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yields here, not great, but we are
seeing some impacts on management,
[SPEAKER_01]: and definitely some promising results in
terms of getting yield that wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I just want to thank the organizers of
the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for coming to our event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point out our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great website with a lot of
tools, lots of past videos, lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different resources, case studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a link to a listserv that we
have that facilitates Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, a huge thank you to Ben
Brockmiller for putting together this
[SPEAKER_01]: slide set, and to just the Sylvan Wine Lab
team members in general for all their work
[SPEAKER_01]: with developing this research in the last
several decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the back there?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the time for crimping when you
plant into the standing rye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so planting, it's the, so with the
standing rye system, there's two ways that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is essentially planting into the
standing rye, adding thesis, and crimping
[SPEAKER_01]: right over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's done on the same day or within 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just planting into the standing rye
to get better seed to soil contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of our research that we did with
trying to boost the early-ness of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soybean planting day, what we're typically
targeting in that system is getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: soybeans planted and then to about the
first true leaf stage, so about the V1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we don't want to plant in there too
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're usually coming in around May
15th, which is usually around the boot
[SPEAKER_01]: stage of rye, and we don't crimp right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll go into the standing rye,
plant that boot stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rye will continue to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soybeans will come up in that standing
rye, and then we'll roll over the soybeans
[SPEAKER_01]: at that early stage of maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we push it too much earlier into May,
the soybeans, they're kind of starved for
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight under that rye canopy,
and they can get really leggy and damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we do it about two weeks before in
a thesis, we do see some stand loss,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have had years where that is
advantageous in terms of the final yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers have had a big success.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a big success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily see enough benefit of
that earlier planting day and crimping
[SPEAKER_01]: over the soybeans to justify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lower risk system to just
plant it and crimp it in a thesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just out of curiosity, what is your plan
right under soybeans that you ran for
[SPEAKER_04]: these tests here, and what's the science
of the soybean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the science of the soybean,
I am not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going at a lower seeding rate that I
think is ideal, particularly with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the research that's been done at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in these trials, we're usually,
I think, at about 225.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think bumping it up, and Matt can
give his opinion, to 240 is probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: sounder recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 225 is already much better than what's
recommended in conventional production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've seen that higher rates do
pay, but 225 to 240 is kind of where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the maximum or the greatest
economic return then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're usually at a 1.6, 1.8 maturity
group, but I'm not sure what the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I think variety trial in
these systems and understanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts of seed size and canopy and other
factors is something we haven't touched
[SPEAKER_01]: upon yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there any assessment, John,
on the cosmetic nature of the soybeans?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they suitable for their island market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not heard, and Klaus might have
more experience there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not heard issues with, well,
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Tia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while to connect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen an issue with staining,
but good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while to click there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you've had seen, you guys have seen
issues with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
