[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping with us here, this is the third
week of our Sports Turf webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, we'll start with Dr. Rossi.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll give us a little bit of an overview
of what this current situation is,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing season-wise, knowing we might get
some perspective on the COVID situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain restrictions, minimum maintenance,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're joined by Dr. Rokasua out of
the University of Nebraska, probably one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the most published and accomplished
researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to find out here, so I'm sure
that'll be a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have some great discussions on
cultivation and certainly many different
[SPEAKER_02]: topics at the end of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank, I'll turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, Rok, I didn't put him up
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put him up to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked to your prolific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at his CV.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done a CV in probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thank you very much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can tell, we're going to have a
very lively conversation when we get to
[SPEAKER_03]: Rok in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl, can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: All good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, welcome to another week of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our third week of doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you watching it on recording,
welcome as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian Wink it did a wonderful job in a
recent tweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of Brian's.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a podcast together talking
about that initial concept him and Munshaw
[SPEAKER_03]: were working on called Blue Muta,
posted something on his Twitter account
[SPEAKER_03]: that really says it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say in the Northeastern United
States, this is exactly what it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: like for the last several years,
never mind just April.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then to only maybe get a good stretch of
weather and to have to feel close for the
[SPEAKER_03]: current situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to distract you for the next 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be pretty close to trying to get
this done so you can get onto the other
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are important in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a message from your land-grant
institution here in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know my colleague at the land-grant
institution at the great state of Nebraska
[SPEAKER_03]: has the same mindset that right now we
need to support each other and the best
[SPEAKER_03]: universities and learning centers can do
is to try to collaborate with each other
[SPEAKER_03]: because solutions will come about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rok knows me well enough to know I think I
know a lot, but I know enough to know I
[SPEAKER_03]: know barely anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's great to have the
collaborators join us and we've had a long
[SPEAKER_03]: list of really good scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again to Rok for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our weekly newsletter in addition
to us yacking here on the computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been writing this up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been journaling the growing seasons
for the last 21 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to get a copy of this,
we're covering topics more in depth in
[SPEAKER_03]: writing and then echoing it in the
webinar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting a double dose of our
mindset and the way we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: approaching it here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to say Pam Sherrod and the
sports turf program at Ohio State to me in
[SPEAKER_03]: many ways is the gold standard of a
program that comprehensively addresses
[SPEAKER_03]: sports field management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put Goatley's program certainly and Iowa
State's program and Rok knows these
[SPEAKER_03]: programs very well over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pam did a wonderful job of putting
together this 10 maintenance practices to
[SPEAKER_03]: focus on during this particular issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the first thing is she
mentions and I commend this to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl will put the link up to these
resources that we cite during the webinar
[SPEAKER_03]: and the things that Rok and I talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first and foremost, you know,
in many ways golf course superintendents
[SPEAKER_03]: are having to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grounds managers are having to deal with
it and sports field managers having to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Restricting the use of your turf grass
areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep it for you to use, but right now
for whatever reason, you can't use it for
[SPEAKER_03]: the activity is restricted, the liability
insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, a lot of the work of sports
field managers falls first and foremost on
[SPEAKER_03]: managing your facility, keeping people
safe, your workforce safe, and of course
[SPEAKER_03]: the users of the facility safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what's really interesting in New York
State, we have, you know, thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: universities and school districts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the New York State School
Facilities and Facilities Management
[SPEAKER_03]: Institute that recently did a survey for
those of you that are joining from school
[SPEAKER_03]: districts wondering about sports fields or
municipalities or larger facilities run by
[SPEAKER_03]: the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a survey which says which
statement best describes your current
[SPEAKER_03]: operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got 80 responses, which I thought
was actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably 10%, 15% of the staff,
the school district staff anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some, the majority of them have
limited maintenance and performing just
[SPEAKER_03]: building checks and just emergency stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few of them have no maintenance staff on
site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really know how much of this
relates to sports fields, but it's some
[SPEAKER_03]: data locally on removing some of the
confusion about what other facilities are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing with regard to their sports fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely the majority of activities that a
lot of our fields would be used for
[SPEAKER_03]: intentionally is not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those things are not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, every place I look, I see that people
are having to break up these sorts of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are happening to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it adds to the confusion about
how you approach managing your fields at
[SPEAKER_03]: this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here at Cornell, we got a hard
decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a hard situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a hard line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no sports and no one's going to be
using this place until mid July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our athletic, our sports turf manager,
Josh Fontaine, put together a minimum
[SPEAKER_03]: action plan for COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sending it to the athletic
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making everybody aware of the kinds
of things that we're doing, including the
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on labor hours, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that everyone is having
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're really fortunate because between
Carl and Josh, we've been, and Chris
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitko, our other sports field management
expert, we've developed sort of how long
[SPEAKER_03]: does it take to do things for the way our
fields are set up and the way we manage
[SPEAKER_03]: these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know on our acreages,
our natural grass acreages that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: caring for the labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd encourage you operational to start
thinking about these sorts of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on how long this goes,
the pressure we get to rehire people to
[SPEAKER_03]: return to normal or the pressure we get to
stay closed, communicating the impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: what's possible and what you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock and I are going to talk about soil
management in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not doing any soil management if
there's one guy on 15 acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, what do you need to do certain
things?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Pam and the folks at the,
I'm sorry, the Ohio State University,
[SPEAKER_03]: forgive me for not bringing that up to
begin with, talks about mowing,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got regional differences
there, fungicide applications,
[SPEAKER_03]: only if disease is active.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have anything active in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got barely any mowing going on North of
a certain line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look at in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, don't be putting on
quick release sources if you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: traffic, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to slow growth to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is going to be dependent on how
much passive traffic you're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are as busy as they've
ever been because people are just walking
[SPEAKER_03]: around all over the place and you have to
determine how much access people have to
[SPEAKER_03]: your sports fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's look at some weather among my
favorite things to do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what it was last week when we
met.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that the 50 degree mark
was barely into South Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it looks like we're in the mid to
low 50s into the Hudson Valley onto Long
[SPEAKER_03]: Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just getting started.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good barometer to keep your eye
on at our forecast website for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northeast about where the soil
temperatures are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this was last week, what was expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in general, while it was a little bit
above normal, the majority of the Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the Northeast hasn't accumulated
many growing degree days at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't expect to accumulate many
this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get a few into the Metropolitan
New York area.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since March 1st in Northern climates,
you know, North of the Pennsylvania New
[SPEAKER_03]: York border, we haven't accumulated any
base 50 growing degree days since the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of March.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the growing degree day
forecast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what does this all mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be very little progress
of the growing season in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_03]: this coming week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck, in upstate, we're going to get some
snow in many parts of upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we look at this one measure of the
potential of a cool season grass plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, and you look at an average
temperature of 50 degrees, which we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: even getting to yet, that mark gives us
less than 25% of active growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not really getting much active
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any mowing we're doing in a lot of our
Northern areas could be related to just
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning up recreational mowing,
keeping people busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're doing that, we certainly are
promoting and we talked about last week in
[SPEAKER_03]: this venue, raising the height of cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not going to go into the mowing
situation again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We uncovered it last week pretty
extensively in our webinar with Bill,
[SPEAKER_03]: another great Nebraska faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one of the things that's going on
throughout, you know, sports fields
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere is, you know, spring baseball
would normally be happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the Ohio State University gave
a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the conditioner off, loose material,
store it, roll and firm the dirt,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just into the infill and pull stray weeds
and raking may be needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, a lot of this can be minimal if you
did a good job of putting the skin to get
[SPEAKER_03]: to bed well, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you left it sort of in shambles last
fall, now it's going to be tougher to get
[SPEAKER_03]: it to minimal maintenance now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's nice and clean now,
it ought to be pretty straightforward to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some simple things you can do
to manage that that's unique to the sports
[SPEAKER_03]: fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, STMA has done a good job in really
relating a lot of great information from
[SPEAKER_03]: practical users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I stress this with every audience that
I talk to.
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular high school turf grass
professor, turf grass science professor,
[SPEAKER_03]: did an excellent job about howling,
talking to people about this issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: about moving traffic around, about
coaching them and training them about the
[SPEAKER_03]: way they like to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this kind of information is
enormously valuable at this time when a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of communication is important,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's using the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the realistic things we could be
doing out here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just finish up here because this
is the important stuff, Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the stuff I know that,
number one, we've got a sports field
[SPEAKER_03]: website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, this is the cultivation
practices that Minna wrote up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've done a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one on our sports field
website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start our conversation here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's first off say, this is something
that we write on our website and a little
[SPEAKER_03]: graphic about how it works in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, I think these benefits are
short-lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna talk a little bit about,
I wanna stop sharing my screen and talk a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about, there we go,
and talk a little bit about what you think
[SPEAKER_03]: about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of guys are asking, hey,
nobody's using the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I cultivate?
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do we start with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's an opportunity if we
can find any benefit in this mess we're
[SPEAKER_01]: currently in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have some people locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're at about the same growth
stage you guys are, surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, we're barely starting to mow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grass is barely starting to green up,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little bit further on growing
degree days and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, since all the fields where
community sports are played, the ball
[SPEAKER_01]: fields or whatever, those are pretty well
shut down, but they're allowed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have managers much like you would
ask me, well, should we do something?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some fields that rarely get
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that as a door opening for some
thatch management and some cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also understanding that they don't have
the crew, but nor do they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: necessity to bang this out in 24 hours or
less and get ready to play on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna say those fields that have
been neglected for thatch management and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation management, this is an open
door to get on those fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you went into the winter with a
field in pretty good shape and you
[SPEAKER_01]: normally would practice some sort of
cultivation, that might be the field I
[SPEAKER_01]: consider not getting on immediately and
working on the ones that allow you the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity, the heavy play fields,
the youth fields, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're all mostly native soil with
some sand base in your neck of the woods,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's take each one at a time here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say there is a field that's a native
soil field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a guy or two, and I got one of
those wheelie gigs with the just drum
[SPEAKER_03]: things that go in, yo big, and I'm ready
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the right tool now in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on the record about hollow tide
cultivation and sand base systems and golf
[SPEAKER_03]: courses, but we're talking about a little
bit of a different animal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the tool you might start with
and how would you approach it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm gonna say that the little whirly
gig thing that you described has minimal
[SPEAKER_01]: use for actual compaction alleviation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great overseeding tool,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It roughs up the soil a little bit on the
surface, Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it really
doesn't do much for subsurface compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe the people that manage the field
say, oh, look, they're out there working,
[SPEAKER_01]: but seriously, you're not doing much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially now you under
exaggerated a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them do actually go to like maybe
two inches, but they are so superficial at
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's all you can do and you're
overseeding and you're looking at that
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than true cultivation for
compaction alleviation, yeah, but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time they're really not that valuable,
except in those instances I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not a big fan of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think those drum types,
they don't have that hydraulic power on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the push power.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really prefer the more golf
course centric, you know, vertically
[SPEAKER_01]: operated hollow tine in an instance with a
native soil field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can pull soil up and actually go
to a certain depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even deep tining, in our region,
at least the deep timers are still out and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a field that has not seen
management and you've got a budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, once again, these are all
qualifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want to go in and aggressively
truly deep cultivate rather than the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface disruption thing you do with those
pull behind non-driven type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the thing for us here in the
Northeast now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got a forecast this morning that
says we're in for anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say from three quarters of an inch
at the low end to as much as two plus
[SPEAKER_03]: inches of rain over the next four to five
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's think through the way we approach
cultivation from a soil moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kinds of soil moisture conditions
on these neglected fields are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: the kinds of conditions I want to do these
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, certainly not wet.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but the drier they are within
reason of keeping the plant alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: the drier they are, the more apt you're
going to get to some.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, if you're using a coring
tine, you know, you'll get some depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
you get some shattering even with a slicer
[SPEAKER_01]: tine or a spoon tine or a lot of the
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you want them on the drier
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about what you just
described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you run it over a field that's dry and
then you get this rain and you've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, silty clay loams or clay loams
or whatever you have in your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking they lean towards the heavier
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they expand and then you've sort
of lost what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're better off looking for a time
when you're going to have a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: drying or dry soil and then get on them
with these devices that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from the soil being a little bit
dry and literally shattering it as they go
[SPEAKER_01]: in and out and moving across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then let's talk about, go back to a
tool now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I really liked shattering to me in a
lot of these native soils, I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually one of the fundamental things
that, you know, will give you this
[SPEAKER_03]: widespread macropore flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hit it in the sweet spot,
if you had to pick one thing, would you
[SPEAKER_03]: take a vertigo drain with a kick over a
hollow tine pulling a core?
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would on native soil fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that I'm much like you,
you know, record it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think we're in a hundred percent
agreement on this recorded today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's where you get the
most benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get continuum of the pores from the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot of things going on that you
don't get with a single hollow tine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know that, and that kick's
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of these devices are designed to
give you kick and you can adjust it on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them, but even a spoon tine at a
different speed will give you a different
[SPEAKER_01]: kick than one that, you know, at another
speed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get as much kick as you got
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want the soil to be a little on
the dry side, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about this new concoction,
the Air 2G?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Sorokin's been playing around with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you paid attention at all to that
being a non-invasive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly it's slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and so in some cases it might be good
for targeted cultivation and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get the targeted cultivation in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do it all field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's some places where it needs
it most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Air 2G, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, I think just as you just
described it, you know, you almost filled
[SPEAKER_01]: in the blanks there, Frank, because I
think that, that you do see some benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: the speed of it, which is going to be less
of an issue now when we're not seeing play
[SPEAKER_01]: on the fields, the speed of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that prescription area
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have an, you know,
we didn't generally do the whole field in
[SPEAKER_01]: one method, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got these little areas that you
could do different things on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the technology and,
and, you know, or the contractor can come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and, and do targeted prescription
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there, there could be some
value in the Air 2G.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen the data up close and
personal, so I'm not ready to widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: say, yeah, that's the device you want to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Serapkin is looking at it,
looking at it fairly close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's another one that you mentioned
some earlier people, premier people in
[SPEAKER_01]: sports turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously he's another one of the rock
stars and what he's doing is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually he takes the time and understands
it and fully exploits or researches it
[SPEAKER_01]: before he starts making recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't think he's come out
and said, yeah, this is the new tool for
[SPEAKER_01]: the millennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this is the new tool that we're
looking at, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he's seeing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's go back for a second to,
you know, bringing up soil for soil sake
[SPEAKER_03]: or polytine cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How worried should I be in general as a
weed site, as a fellow weed scientist?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: How worried will I be about, you know,
now my soil's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may, this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to plan to do it in this window
in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm still not open, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do we worry later we go with this
to create potential weed problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank, because this is what, if you,
if you're on one of your higher maintained
[SPEAKER_01]: fields and you've been routinely applying
pre-emergent and doing broad leaf weed
[SPEAKER_01]: control, I don't see bringing soil to the
surface as much of a problem because over
[SPEAKER_01]: time you've reduced the soil seed bank,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, this is true in
golf, it's true in sports turf,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I worry about a field that's on the
margin that doesn't get the aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-emergent application or post-emergent
control for annual grasses or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, laying underneath that
surface as a fellow weed scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is just a seed bank that's ready to
pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't care whether it's annual
bluegrass or crabgrass or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get goose grass up in your neck of the
woods?
[SPEAKER_03]: We are alarmingly getting more and more
further and further north, says Matt
[SPEAKER_03]: Elmore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's alarming because that's
not a weed you want because it requires a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole different toolbox of herbicides to
actually get effective control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in sports fields in our area,
goose grass is far more problematic than
[SPEAKER_01]: crabgrass because goose grass loves those
compacted soils, right, in front of goal
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes, you know, in the run through on
first base.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see goose, if I want to isolate it,
I'll go there first, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kind of things that I
would worry about on a marginal field
[SPEAKER_01]: where you haven't been maintaining it at
the level that you might in your
[SPEAKER_01]: championship field or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to bring up a ton of weed
seed when you do that and then also open
[SPEAKER_01]: it up for any weed seed that blows in to
fall into this convenient hole that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't collapse in on itself as quickly
as a spoon time or a slicer time or even a
[SPEAKER_01]: solid time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so let's talk about a non-invasive
way then before we start taking a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The airway, we've had been a fan and then
not a fan and then a fan in some places of
[SPEAKER_03]: the airway that stands behind a tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just these knives that go in and
makes a slit maybe four to six inches
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe get a little bit of
shattering but the beauty of it is in my
[SPEAKER_03]: mind, the attraction initially is you can
do it really rapidly and it seems to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a slit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we had some problem on our finer
fields where it actually does a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: tearing and seems to cause some sort of
browning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wonder on these fields that maybe
don't get a lot of attention now that we
[SPEAKER_03]: could spend some attention on practice
fields and otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know there's not a lot of research
in this area but I'm just thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: the time going in and being really fast to
do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the airway or devices like that,
the slicer time, obviously if you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: it in three to four to five inches,
that's better than one to two because then
[SPEAKER_01]: we create other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Minner actually did some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at one of the Iowa State field days
when he was still physically on campus and
[SPEAKER_01]: he went two directions and everyone wants
to go perpendicular.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you go at an angle and you're sent
that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: His data show that you go as an angle and
you pick up more surface area as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: more aggressively get better aeration or
whatever in the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, go at a 30 to the first
pass, not at a 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when he said that on fields that were
typical recreational fields or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: he saw that open it up and then he says,
if you're going to slice up a field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should always throw out seed and I've
always believed that there's a reason for
[SPEAKER_01]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even if you only get 20%
germination, you got 20% germination and
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed that wasn't there and especially
on these fields that are less so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the use of a slicer time,
whether it's an airway or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get across a field in less time
than it takes to do a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically operated hollow tying or device
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get on it and get on it
frequently too for that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if you're at a skeleton crew,
you know, I see a few things, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: guys are still keeping painting their
corner lines so they don't have to redo
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going out on the fields and
putting in the corner markers so that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can string lines from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of things guys,
even with a small crew can do to save some
[SPEAKER_03]: time, do these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the question of, well,
you know, I'm a little bit further south.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little bit more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this university field and this
high-end municipal field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I core and consider sand top
dressing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this sand from last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you like about slinging sand on
this, on native soil fields?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've cored them and we're
starting to think, hey, maybe this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: good time to get them a sand cap on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like that approach, throwing some
sand at this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like sand capping if you're committed to
doing it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're committed to doing it once,
then that's a horrible combination,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put a cap on it and that cap
has to be developed over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, we didn't,
you know, we always revert back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: golf course trade, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they started with pushup greens,
then they started top dressing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not until they get an appreciable
layer of sand on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this is something you just want to
do like in a short term and not commit to
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it's a horrible idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Carl, we got any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe one thing I had a question on is
a lot of people will typically go out,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll do their core cultivation or
whatever cultivation practice,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they'll go maybe throw some seed
and then fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, thinking about the fertilizer
part of that now, is that something you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to need after you do this,
this cultivation practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can you say, hey, maybe I've got a
bunch of time and not have to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that question only because right
now you really don't want things growing
[SPEAKER_01]: as aggressively as you normally would,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to say there's adequate soil
nutrition to get seed going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then hopefully this is
going to break sometime in the not too
[SPEAKER_01]: distant future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you said, I think you said
something like late June or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're a little bit behind you
and in our region, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking at probably August before
we're going to be through our worst,
[SPEAKER_01]: worst phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't peaked yet in central United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to peak in about three
weeks with COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be a little bit later,
but still that said, I am not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilize if I don't think it's absolutely
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the field says to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're just inviting growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a limited crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to increase your mowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you probably talked about
raising mowing heights and maybe the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth regulators, you know,
applying fertilizer and growth regulators
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of contrary to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would say, yeah, don't,
you'd normally put down a starter and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd normally push it fairly hard because
you want that seed to get up and going,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's because we want to get people
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You no longer have that problem.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would not, unless something tells
you, you have to more times than not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to put additional fertility
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But love the idea of slinging seed,
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you got bare ground, throw the
damn seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the best chance ever with nobody
playing around on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you cutting higher to me, if you've
had chronic areas, this is where the
[SPEAKER_03]: targeted precision thing comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind is this, you know, gold mouths
or, or, or where coaches and players stand
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, wherever those pinch points
are, um, focusing in on those areas with a
[SPEAKER_03]: guy or two, you know, you can get a couple
of gold mouths done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, you know, a day, if you want to
cut it out and redo it, or just sling some
[SPEAKER_03]: seed as you're passing by, no harm,
no foul there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a, I'm a big fan and seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know it adds to your budget,
but it's not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I mean, seriously,
when you look at the other things you do
[SPEAKER_01]: on a day to day basis, it's not really
that expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, I would put, even during
regular play, you know, under normal
[SPEAKER_01]: times, I would be throwing seed out and I,
you know, people say, well, you mean
[SPEAKER_01]: ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about, you know, so if you
only get 10% germination, that's 10% more
[SPEAKER_01]: than you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, yeah, I'm all for throwing
seed out at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting, you know, once again,
cruising around with Minner one time in
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowa and we were taking compaction
measurements across these fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worst place is where the players
stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nothing grows there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have put carpet there to
alleviate that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was, and so I would be throwing
seed out there constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, every time you do anything and
open it up even in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: or bear oil bearers, like you said,
in front of Goldmouse or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever, wherever, you know, between the
hash mark, where you know those problem
[SPEAKER_01]: spot exists, let's get a really dense turf
going there because you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mowing higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get a really nice root
system on it because you're mowing higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the things that throw in the agronomy
of it that we ignore because we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to maintain a slick plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw seed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, you brought up one more
thing, Carl, before we go, we're here at
[SPEAKER_03]: the, almost at the witching hour and,
and the idea of cutting back mowing rock
[SPEAKER_03]: to root deeper ties in with one of the
reasons we poke holes to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can do that shattering and combine
it with mowing higher and less frequently,
[SPEAKER_03]: those roots will explore the shattering
that you do as deep as you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know, what do we, what do we
tell our introductory students,
[SPEAKER_01]: where do roots grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, no, they grow in the air
spaces in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds rudimentary,
but it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have air space, you don't get
rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those heavily targeted prescription
areas, throw some seed out, get some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivation in native soils,
a little bit drier is better and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to pull a core at this point
in time.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Carl, I see questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got a good question from Neil at
RIT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's asking, I've got an interest in
the natural soil field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say I'm committed to,
to putting the sand cap on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much sand should go down?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how many times per year,
I guess, you know, how quickly can you do
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you do that all at once right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you're going to have to
consider over two or three years?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start with this rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're in agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cap's got to be about three to four
inches, maybe with a slit drain or
[SPEAKER_03]: something underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the superintendents out in
Seattle were able to put down an inch and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half in a single year when they were
trying to fight worms years and years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing some smothering and,
you know, I mean, that's a lot of sand in
[SPEAKER_01]: one, you know, in one, in one year even,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we, we know you're putting on
about, about an inch with about 22 cubic
[SPEAKER_01]: yards on, you know, our cubic feet,
feet, sorry, for a thousand per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to put on an inch,
that's what it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to put on two inches,
it would take twice that I'm not sure any
[SPEAKER_01]: term, even under no play conditions,
I'm not sure you can aggressively put that
[SPEAKER_01]: much sand on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would have to commit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have three to four inches on
the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's going to change the
contour and you're going to have to move
[SPEAKER_01]: it accordingly, especially in crown
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, on a crown football field,
for example, some of the soccer fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously that's less of an issue,
but still you do want some slope on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface to get water off surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If far, you know, that's important,
you know, native soil fields begin to
[SPEAKER_03]: function by having a crown.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, many people don't really think about
this anymore because we've had sand based
[SPEAKER_03]: systems for so long that you don't see the
heavy crowns like you used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is important if you're going to do
some capping that, you know, you do it in
[SPEAKER_03]: relation to the subsoil, like you would do
a putting surface and really for it to
[SPEAKER_03]: function, you got to have some,
some drains along the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have some catch drains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise the place where rock and I just
said, you get the most traffic by the
[SPEAKER_03]: coaches is where you put in all the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just going to, it's just going
to pond there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, the sand will flow,
but you know that on that interface in
[SPEAKER_01]: between, it's going to saturate top before
it goes below, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sheets off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get on the site, you know,
eventually you'll get so much on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface and you know, they, there will be
some intermixing of roots and stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get stability on the surface,
but that doesn't happen, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: without several years of aggressive top
dressing, probably multiple, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: core removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do it more aggressively,
drier soils, you could probably solid time
[SPEAKER_01]: it and get there just, just as quick cause
I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using this all the time, even on
native fields when they're dried,
[SPEAKER_01]: not when we have the moisture issues we
talk about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Carl, how are we doing
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're right at, right at half an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, fastest 30 minutes in turf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're calling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're happy to join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right back here, right back here next
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Have a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great week.
Have a great week.
