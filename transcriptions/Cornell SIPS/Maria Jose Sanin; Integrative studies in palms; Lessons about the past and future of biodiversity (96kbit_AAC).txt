[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very fortunate to be here this time
of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my pleasure to talk about palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I titled this talk Integrative Studies in
Palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just do field research in palms,
but it is my group of focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope after this talk you'll feel
motivated to at least explore some aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of this fascinating group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use palms to navigate the time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say my base is in population
phylogenomics and population ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I work with geologists in projects
about geogenomics, historical demography,
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeography, and with chemical ecologists
and entomologists on the reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology of palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to make all of this information
available for conservation plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: endangered species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce the palm family,
at least the relevant aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: family, and then talk about three of the
topics I've addressed and even some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: current work I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it is finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talk a little bit about the future and
leave some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this family, it's a well-known,
pretty famous family, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of you, I'm sure, know it's a
mainly tropical family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species are subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But diversity isn't evenly distributed
through the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two diversity centers,
Northwestern South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here and then Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes 2,600 species and 188 genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has evolved over 100 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, palms are adapted to warm
environments, so high menennial
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, low temperature seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coldest month has to be above
5,000 Celsius because they can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: cope with frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very interesting aspect about palms
is that they can be very abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Amazonian forest, where this study
was done, taking data from all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plots in Amazonia, they list the 20 most
abundant frequent tree, palms are not
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, but tree-like trees, in the
Amazonian basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seven of the 20 are palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most abundant tree, like stem,
is Euterpe precatoria, which is the Acai
[SPEAKER_00]: palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're structurally very important for
tropical ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we found that in many cases,
these extreme abundance that leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: mono-dominance is related to disturbance,
to human disturbance in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has led to the hypothesis of Amazonia
as planted forest, where these forests are
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched with species by human management
of these forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was certainly the case for
Cerroxilon, where we worked in these
[SPEAKER_00]: central cordillera in the Andes and in
other spots along the tropical Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're very abundant,
very frequent, there's still discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new species being described.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of last year's gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a very ordinary palm when
you look at it, very ordinary understory
[SPEAKER_00]: palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of native people, local people
living around these forests, that led to
[SPEAKER_00]: the discovery that, well, actually the
fruits are foraged on by wild boars,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flowers are underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who pollinates these palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just highlights the importance of
working with people around biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know a lot more about the
natural history of species around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps because they're so abundant,
and structurally important, peoples from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tropics use them in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to build their homes, this is the
inside of a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the floors, the walls,
made of the Riartia del Toidi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roofs, the entire homes, fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevated gardens from Moetinia Calbrieri,
a beautiful palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stairs to climb up to those gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even what's used inside homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a part of a broom being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even what's eaten inside of those
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the peach palm, a wonderful
source of many nutrients for many
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in the American tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is of no surprise that palms are
named in just every culture, in just every
[SPEAKER_00]: language.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are non-Spanish names for the peach
palm in the Colombia and Amazonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see you'll find some
similarities between these words because
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these languages are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they're so important and so
used, so fundamental for human
[SPEAKER_00]: livelihoods, they're named.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a tropical home.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And palms are everywhere in the tropical
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're losing forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without forests, we lose this backup
resource for rural communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this incredible opportunity to
learn from palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is even more concerning given
their conservation state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study, 80% of the world's palms
were studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 56% of them were found were in some
endangerment category, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: method used to classify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red triangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bars, they're showing
different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have a high percentage of the
threatened species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fall in many categories,
whether it's evolutionary distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: species, functionally distinct species
that are not replaceable, or they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: by humans for culture, food, utensils,
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of their category,
you always find some large percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the species endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is worse for the regions having
over 10 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the species-rich areas in the world
have higher endangerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the areas where people rely on
them most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research addresses the general
overarching question of how do species and
[SPEAKER_00]: populations persist in time and what they
can teach us about their changing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be like the overarching
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with a focus on palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk a little bit about my
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been intrigued by
elevational gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've worked in the tropics,
you can perceive the high turnover from
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're absolutely interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very variable between different
slopes and different mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly more so because elevation
gradients offer climatic gradients that go
[SPEAKER_00]: along with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because palms are so well adapted to
warmer conditions, it's very striking that
[SPEAKER_00]: some groups are adapted to cool
environments from the highlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular genus Hyphanes,
it includes 35 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they live from 0 meters above sea
level in mangroves to 3,200 meters above
[SPEAKER_00]: sea level close to the tree line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to understand how this
adaptation to cool habitats evolves in
[SPEAKER_00]: their phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we built different phylogenies with
different data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Sanger sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also put together this phylogeny
based on hybrid capture using 4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear coating and non-coating regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the summarized species tree,
astral tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've colored the clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows you is that all
clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each clade is a color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is all clades have
evolved to live or to cover the elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single clade repeatedly has a
species that lives in warmer conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid elevations, and high elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens repeatedly for every
clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, when you look at temperature
related variables, here indicated by
[SPEAKER_00]: principal components, or precipitation
related variables, you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation related variables have
higher phylogenetic signal, whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature related variables do not
because they flip and flop around
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the model that explains how
these are evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the different clades basically have
species covering the entire gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adaptation to different temperatures
can evolve in all of these clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this all happens by conserved low
precipitation seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these palms can evolve if there's still
low precipitation seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicates a little bit about what
would be a big threat to their future
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't really cope with higher
seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas they seem to do well in many
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complexes like this, I find, as Irsuta
that we've been studying and that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing to sample to cover the
elevation gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have populations at the tree line and
populations by the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to understand what the
differences in populations at different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments can tell us about adaptation
to different climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group I've studied for years,
Chelsea mentioned it, is the roxylon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wax palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very fascinating because they live
in extreme environments for palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in high elevation forests,
cool forests that are constantly covered
[SPEAKER_00]: by mist and clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is extreme for palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also dioecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have female and male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're only slightly dimorphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see this is the female flowers
and the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar, but the male flowers
are just slightly drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can reach to 3,500 meters above
sea level, which is 1,500 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very high in the mountains for palms at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to understand how are these
populations making it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they persisting in such an extreme
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more so because we sometimes find
congenerics coexisting within the same
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you even find centipede in these
extreme groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we followed a forest that had three
different species from cerroxylon living
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cerroxylon farvifrons in the middle,
and ventricosum left, and vogelianum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find viable populations of all
three living together at 3,200 meters
[SPEAKER_00]: above sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed their flower visitors and
their phenology for three consecutive
[SPEAKER_00]: years every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that 50 morphospecies,
50 insects, visit all of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found no differences between the three
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the effective pollination services are
mainly carried out by Mistrops rotundula,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this small miniature beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the male inflorescence emits these
alkanes, these aliphatic compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they attract the beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come by swarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed on the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they mate in the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're attracted to the female
inflorescences by the same scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's by deceit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they arrive at the female
inflorescences, and there's nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they pollinate the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this beetle is important in the
pollination of all three species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see how they partitioned
this resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's temporal partition, which is
classical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the three species and three
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the summary of the three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they have different
flowering peaks for male inflorescences,
[SPEAKER_00]: female inflorescences, and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flowering peaks occur outside of the
rainy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see the rainy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these yellow peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has probably to do with volatile
emission being more efficient during the
[SPEAKER_00]: drier seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did find there's some overlap
between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the potential of pollen from
species 1 to end up in the stigmas of
[SPEAKER_00]: species 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're closely related,
we had some questions about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this system is highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reproduction is phenomenal in the sense
that the smaller species can produce 3,500
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits per season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the larger species, ventricosum,
10,500 fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these fruits feed two kinds of
tucanets, green jays, parrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this even happens in areas that have
been deforested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've also worked in this other site,
the Tochesito Valley, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbed, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every season, during masting season
and non-masting seasons, there's efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think these three species,
at least, are a fundamental habitat for
[SPEAKER_00]: the beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some questions after having done
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three species are taxonomically very
easy to identify, even from far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Vogelianum, and this is
ventricosum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with very little training,
you can tell them apart, even from the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're taxonomically good species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the same in every single
population where you visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you collect ventricosum in Ecuador
or in Colombia, they're exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Parvifrons, in Bolivia or Colombia,
they're clear species taxonomically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are they really genetically isolated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have these overlapping
flowering peaks, and they share the main
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is gene sharing, is it
adaptive?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sampled populations all throughout
their range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these populations are patchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some scattered individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to at least sample all of the
population patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled all but one species that was
more recently described, with emphasis on
[SPEAKER_00]: the highland species complex, which is a
monophyletic complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sometimes live in symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this same genomic data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the highland species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Vogelianum in green and
Parvifrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it's highly overlapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this Indiwense
ventricosum seriferum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of replace each other
latitudinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all live at the same elevation,
between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the underlying cartoon
phylogeny for this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that we have pure
individuals for Parvifrons and pure
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals for Indiwense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then seriferum and ventricosum in dark
blue here, they fall everywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hybrid index is admixture-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this led to the idea that we have
really three species and then two
[SPEAKER_00]: introgressed forms that we've been calling
in taxonomy ventricosum and seriferum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actually just admixt forms of
the other three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring genetic data for all three
species, Vogelianum, Indiwense,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Parvifrons, shown by these triangular
graphs, you find some pure populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you find, indeed, ventricosum and
seriferum right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically sharing genes with
all three species, which we could
[SPEAKER_00]: understand through what we knew from their
reproductive ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because admixture-based methods aren't
enough to detect hybridization or
[SPEAKER_00]: introgressive hybridization, we also use
the statistics, or ABBA-BABA statistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the proportion of derived versus
ancestral allele sites for ABBA and BABA
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find, and then the F4 ratio,
which is an excess in allele sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an excess of D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these larger circles are basically
showing you where there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that's particularly so when we
have Parvifrons and seriferum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was our initial observation from the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you map those populations to
their geographical locations, we find that
[SPEAKER_00]: the pure populations are at the center of
their distribution, whereas the most
[SPEAKER_00]: admixt populations are at the periphery of
their entire distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the entire distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And towards the margins is where you find
the more introgressed populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see if these introgressed
regions coincide or matched with sites
[SPEAKER_00]: under selection by these evolutionary
models, by lieu and collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that's rarely the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So introgressed regions are normally not
under positive selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we understood this is,
well, we have three species that can share
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are differences in their
population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two species with large
populations and then one species with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The species with the smaller population
size will amplify the introgressed regions
[SPEAKER_00]: because of drift and demographic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called the genomic neutralist
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just highlights the essential role
of inefficient reproductive barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sharing genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't have efficient
reproductive barriers in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is amplified through demographic
processes because you have smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: populations in the periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you move out of the center of their
distribution, populations become smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: and smaller and individuals become
sparser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus, these introgressed regions can
become more amplified in the receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was interesting because it also
shows that for some of these species,
[SPEAKER_00]: a way of maintaining diversity levels is
through gene sharing, specifically so in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where populations are smaller and
individuals are more sparser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it highlights also the importance of
having congenerics in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about protecting one wax
palm, but all of the wax palms that live
[SPEAKER_00]: together in that forest because they can
potentially share genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk about geogenomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is integrative work I do with
geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy doing integrative work and
working with geologists because I learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always amazed by the level of
complexity of their work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing fieldwork with them just shows
you a whole different things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really good to work with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with them, we've been working on the
notion that the Andes, although they seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like a continuous 7,000 kilometer mountain
chain now, they haven't always been
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have two different models for
Andean evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just a continuous chain that
gradually uplift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a second model where you
have isolated mountains that form and then
[SPEAKER_00]: later connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two scenarios offer different
evolutionary scenarios for biota,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a continuous mountain chain,
then you can have dispersal occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have uplift and then
connection, then dispersal of species
[SPEAKER_00]: should be episodic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should happen at a given time frame
when the mountains connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bird data, there's a lot of bird data
on the distributions of birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bird coordinates, bird occurrences have
been used to create this bioregions along
[SPEAKER_00]: the Andes, or birds at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a lot of turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in the Andes, one thing you
will perceive is that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what this map is showing from
bird occurrence data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within short distances, you have turnover
of species and even phylogenetic breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to study these phylogenetic
breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to study that with
geologists using a group that is widely
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed and across the different
breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use geonomoundata, which includes
different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of like a complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex because it's very
morphologically variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the very small adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see here, but the
inflorescence is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a meter tall adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have taller adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pinnae, the leaf segments,
can look many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've described this whole complex as a
hypercryptic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes many genetic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very complicated morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do grow across these breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sampled them in all of the
populations we found through the Andes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, from the Sierra Nevada Santa
Marta here, and into the eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: Cordillera, central and western
Cordillera, and what's called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian massif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found there's four genetic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these four genetic groups,
when working on their distribution with
[SPEAKER_00]: geologists, we found that these genetic
breaks coincide with the main faults that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur within these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are faults interesting to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if mountains were segmented,
if mountains were formed by different
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain segments that only later
reconnect, they would have been broken or
[SPEAKER_00]: segmented along these fault lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because topography doesn't grow in the
same way along faults than non-faulted
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have differences in relief
just along these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at those genetic groups,
basically they occupy the same climatic
[SPEAKER_00]: space in terms of temperature and
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it on both of these PCAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also here, all of these genetic groups
basically occupy the same climatic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take morphological traits and
you map all of the genetic groups
[SPEAKER_00]: together, they overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take the sympatrix,
there does seem to be some morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if groups are sympatric, they have
displaced morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're allopatric, then they overlap
in terms of morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see if these sites under
these FSD outliers for higher divergence,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tajima's outliers, which were showing us
drift and population reductions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sites under positive selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they map to the same sites in the
genome, so these are the chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we find is that they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they barely overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So few sites are under divergence and
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except two genes that play a role in
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, no surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering times are playing an important
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then response to environment,
so chill and light responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the role of faults then,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had been working with
geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think is these faults create
initial vicarians, so initial allopatry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's these divergence between
groups is reinforced by drift and in
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel to morphological displacement and
phenological displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we had this system where we
were thinking about ambient segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The geologists were sampling, and we were
trying to understand if they had been
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous or not and what plants were
showing us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want plants to inform us about
their changing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had the bird maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our genetic groups for geonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wonderful paper came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a paleogeographical reconstruction of
that particular area where we had found
[SPEAKER_00]: group turnover, genetic group turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular area, there's what
was called the Trans-Andean Portal,
[SPEAKER_00]: which connected the Amazonian basin with
the Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might seem like a small thing,
but it's actually huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the greatest rainforest connected to
the Pacific, which means the two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most plant diverse regions connecting
through this low pass area where the Andes
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't high enough to isolate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurred until 6 million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was late Miocene, which would have
affected the distribution of many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used our data set from Cerroxilon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had sampling set from all of the Andes
and across the Trans-Andean Portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built several phylogenies again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used biogeobares for
biogeographical reconstructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we did found, we did find that
wax palms were in the Andes since the
[SPEAKER_00]: Miocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were already there since the late
Miocene, but they were there south of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecuador, so in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only in the Pliocene that they
could disperse into the eastern Cordillera
[SPEAKER_00]: of Colombia, and only between three and
two million years that they could disperse
[SPEAKER_00]: into the central and western Cordillera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was episodic, and it was late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dispersal was not continuous throughout
their history.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the highland clades repeatedly
dispersed to this area at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: except this lowland group, which is not
indicative of highland continuity,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went out with geologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, you can't really see too much
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a map of that area in southern
Colombia where the Trans-Andean Portal
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sampled all of this area with,
so it's like a three-degree longitude and
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sampled with geologists,
and we found these ignimbrites,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are rocks that are ejected by large
volcanic eruptions, caldera-forming
[SPEAKER_00]: volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're thrown, and you can date when
they made surface, through geochronology,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically uranium to lead decay
in a mineral called zircon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, you can know the age of the
rocks when this volcanic eruption
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, all of these rocks were
ejected in a very large perimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very large area, which I'm showing
here by the degrees, between two and three
[SPEAKER_00]: million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exactly at the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only did we find evidence for this
large-scale volcanic eruption,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also found that these volcanoes are
capable of producing lava flows that can
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up low valleys to one kilometer deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a low pass, but then you
have a large-scale magmatic addition which
[SPEAKER_00]: can fill up the low valley, then you can
connect mountain segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is added to bulging and other
processes that occur along with volcanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our paleogeographical model is
basically, you did have highlands before
[SPEAKER_00]: five million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did have mountains, but they weren't
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through volcanism, across these
centers, you would have magmatic additions
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically connected segments and
allowed species to disperse in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular time window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we had worked with faulting and
volcanoes, we teamed up with bird
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers who were working on this
hybrid zone in the same volcanic area,
[SPEAKER_00]: volcanic center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wrote this perspective,
which basically ties geological processes
[SPEAKER_00]: to life evolution processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cortex bulging, valley filling,
lava flows, tephra falls, gas and aerosol
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, to diversification,
extinction, and dispersal across different
[SPEAKER_00]: time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to bring together
processes in the geosciences and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: life sciences, which is what geogenomics
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now switching gears to the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Amazon, but right close to
the Andes, so the Amazonian-Andean
[SPEAKER_00]: foothills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're particularly going now to the
Vaupe's Ark and to the southern expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Vaupe's Ark, which is this
Chiricate Range that I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not 5,000 meters elevation,
which we had for the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smaller mountain range,
but it's enough to have rivers flow north
[SPEAKER_00]: and south of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does affect drainage evolution and
the transport of sediments, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in this corner again of
northwestern South America, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have this perpendicular series of
mountains that are called the Vaupe's Ark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the southern expression of
that ark, which is called the Chiricate
[SPEAKER_00]: Range, is what you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole range uplifted at 8 million
years ago, and some of these rocks that
[SPEAKER_00]: are exposed are older, but the ark is
thought to be 8 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this creates the water divide between
Orinokia and Amazonia, which are two very
[SPEAKER_00]: important biogeographical regions for
South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Orinokia is seasonally dry savannas,
while Amazonia is closed canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're extremely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because of this low relief created by
this ark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our parentheses here is that this
Chiricate Range hosts one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary archaeological sites,
kilometers and kilometers of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: paintings that have been dated at 20,000
years ago to present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these rock paintings, you can even
find animals that are now extinct,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the giant sloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really old rock paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our sampling sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Amazonia, there have been
different factors that have been studied
[SPEAKER_00]: that influence the distribution of its
biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So current climatic variables,
vegetation structure, which doesn't lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to much turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is river and barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect that river basin evolution
has on structuring composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to explore that in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study that in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what was found with these maps for
amphibians is that this is the water
[SPEAKER_00]: divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have here in dark green and in
yellow, that's the water divide between
[SPEAKER_00]: Orinokia and Amazonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the compositions are very
distant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adjacent regions, but with very
different compositions for amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used this group, Astrocarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spiny palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very abundant,
very important in Amazonia, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: for local economies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, the water divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have here is, again, that water
divide along the Vaupe's arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been sampling Astrocarium
genocantum, which is an understory palm
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see here, Chambira, a Tierra
firme canopy palm, and Yawari,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a riparian lives along rivers
palm of the same genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been sampling along the rivers
of this whole region of the water divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done seven rivers so far,
covering the water divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to take a minute to show
you Astrocarium jawari.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always lives along rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really sample it by walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sample it from the boat,
because there's nowhere to stand on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how complex vegetation is
there at that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Astrocarium jawari.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing a little bit of its crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is, even if this relief
system isn't as high as the Andes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does structure populations north and
south of the relief system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all of the three species,
even if they have different habitats,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they have different life histories,
the individuals do group north and south
[SPEAKER_00]: of the divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that relief system,
where it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the southern populations
and northern populations, north and south
[SPEAKER_00]: of the divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: South of the divide, north of the divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the river species, it's more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a softer break between north and
south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this is because of its habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cut is softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it has to do with the fact
that fruits land on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they remain viable for many
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can float on rivers and then
disperse and then the soil is more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient in this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: FSTs are low between north and south for
all of the three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work I'm doing with funding from
PAPESP Brazil and Minciacias Colombia with
[SPEAKER_00]: South American collaborators in Campinas
and in the Universidad Nacional de
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So structure is divergence is not big
between north and south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Tierra Firme species,
you do have more outliers for FST.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they consistently group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the southern groups consistently group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are snapper calibrated trees using
snips and using the coalescence and
[SPEAKER_00]: generation times to estimate ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that divergence
between north and south, so here between
[SPEAKER_00]: north and south, north and south,
is a couple hundred thousand years at
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really doesn't seem to have anything
to do with the formation of this arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more so with how rivers have evolved
later after the arc formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more with river incision dynamics
starting at 130,000 years and not with
[SPEAKER_00]: uplift per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this wonderful paper if you're
interested in how rivers form,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially about this area from Abreta and
collaborators explaining the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: how rivers form after they have formed in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're running demographic models to
understand how much gene flow there has
[SPEAKER_00]: been, if it has been in different time
windows, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had worked with campesino communities
in the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sampling in all of these rivers of
Amazonia led me to work with Amazonian
[SPEAKER_00]: people and become really in awe of how
much they know about biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to show how important they are,
how much they know, and how much they
[SPEAKER_00]: protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved, I had some experience with
campesino Andean communities, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural diversity in Amazonia is a lot
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linguistic diversity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a more remote area in
northwestern Amazonia at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more remote, hard to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started by just working with
occurrence data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we produced these distribution models
for all 260 Colombian palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colombia has 10% of the species
diversity for the world in terms of palms
[SPEAKER_00]: and 260 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stacked those distribution models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see if there are richness
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in pink, you see the most
species-rich places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in red, these are the species are
the polygons for collectively owned lands,
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous collectively owned lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always been this debate,
at least in Colombia and several South
[SPEAKER_00]: American countries, if collectively owned
lands are good for conservation or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: if collectively owned lands are protected
or not, or if they fall under the tragedy
[SPEAKER_00]: of the commons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to show that there's high
diversity in areas where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: collectively owned territories,
but there's also they're also away from
[SPEAKER_00]: threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we find most threatened species,
this is the map of threatened species,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really away from these collectively
owned territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just highlights the importance for
conservation of collectively owned lands
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultural knowledge related to these
territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we teamed up with leaders from
different communities, from the Bora,
[SPEAKER_00]: Murimuinane, Tikuna communities,
to work on Astrocarium, because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: been sampling it, because we were more
familiar with that system, and with
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students Lina from Colombia and
Carmen from ASU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up with this research
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Olmar's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Olmar's relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Astrocarium palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are communities only accessing,
so just harvesting palms, or are they
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to safeguarding and modifying
biodiversity, at least in terms of these
[SPEAKER_00]: palms that are recognized and used by
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the genomic architecture and selection
of managed versus wild species different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting now with Astrocarium
because there are so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: species that are used and managed,
but we have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using Astrocarium because it's a
system we know more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is their historical demography
different, reflecting cultural uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we understand, by studying their
historical demography, can we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: something about use, the history of use of
these species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ties to two important models in
anthropology and archaeology, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a paradigm shift in South America,
and in particular in these communities
[SPEAKER_00]: from Northwestern South America,
which is the well-known shift between
[SPEAKER_00]: hunter gathering and agriculture,
because uses of plants are so different,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way you use landscape and you use
land is so different in the two different
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hunter gatherers are generalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use many, many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only collect parts of native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't affect plant densities as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exert low selective pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work with mostly wild genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in agricultural societies,
people are more specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They replace the standing vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more sedentary, so less mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant densities are determined,
chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high selective pressure of the
used species, and genomes are more
[SPEAKER_00]: managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Amazonian system is somewhere in
between, because many wild species are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, but not within traditional
agriculture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's they're grown or enriched in nearby
forests, and they use some species that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not native from that site,
but many of the native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what has been termed the hunter
gatherer horticulturalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create these gardens that they tend,
but they also grow things within the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like managed forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's connected to what's called the
Chagra systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are still generalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use many, many, many species,
including many palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow and collect parts of native
plants, but they don't entirely replace
[SPEAKER_00]: what's standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep some of the native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They increase the density of some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will increase the densities of
their used species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these homes are moved around,
and they are highly mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know about their selection
pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How managed the genomes are, and if they
are structural effects on the genomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: these species or not, if we can find some
sign of not domestication, but of
[SPEAKER_00]: management at least, and if they behave as
wild species, and why they seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to these anthropogenic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Astrocharum chambida is one of these
species that you can rarely find in deep
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's native.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get away from humans,
you no longer find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's managed, used for fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a source of fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really found within deep forests,
mostly around humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's used this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's used within these managed forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The young leaves from young individuals
are harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibers are extracted, washed and
dried, then dyed, and then woven into
[SPEAKER_00]: bags, hammocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sister species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is chambida, the managed species
for fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sister species is sympatric,
not managed, not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw an excellent opportunity to
compare if there's something different
[SPEAKER_00]: about their genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're sister, they're sympatric,
but one is managed and the other one is
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we haven't been able to flash
freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know this is an essential part of
getting good genome assemblies,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you need long reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been difficult to flash freeze
and export, because you need all these
[SPEAKER_00]: permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we do it without flash freezing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working with these different
institutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're basically doing is we're
extracting high molecular weight DNA from
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues fixed in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're doing chromatin, the high C
sequencing, from tissues fixed in PGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shield, which is this solution only under
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're doing RNA sequencing from
tissues fixed in RNA later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go to the field and we collect,
we collect in all of these solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the herbarium sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from silica dry tissues, we also try
to get packed bio long reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do get something from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what we got is 1 eighth of the
expected yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we assembled, it was like 2
thirds of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genomes are rather large,
3 to 4 gigabase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got 2 thirds of the whole length of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's satisfying you get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you won't get chromosome level,
fully resolved whole genomes if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with silica dry tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you won't be able to annotate them,
because we won't have the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we are with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't still have results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still wanted to show you because
this is where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in the future, I still want to
continue working with problems around
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they can tell us so much about
anthropogenic systems, but also about what
[SPEAKER_00]: humans create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humans create drier systems or systems
that tend to dry more, more open
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, this species does very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In transitional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they can tell us a lot about
the evolution of people and of more
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbed environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're teaming up with Montgomery
Botanical Center and colleagues from ASU
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on the historical demography.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also trying to find, but we haven't
been successful so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are extracting more and more
environmental DNA from archaeological
[SPEAKER_00]: soils to see if we find this form on
archaeological soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to continue with my future goals,
I've been very collections-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the enormous potential of
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colombia, I formed this tissue
collection, which now covers all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian palms and has now 5,300
specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this tissue collection,
I could, along with herbarium,
[SPEAKER_00]: work in herbaria, I could write
monographs, describe species, work on red
[SPEAKER_00]: listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are very valuable assets
because they help prepare society,
[SPEAKER_00]: children, students, and researchers to
become interested in the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really time and space
observatories facing biodiversity crises.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can guide our exploration strategies,
so where, when, how to collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cultural repositories,
too, about plant and human species and
[SPEAKER_00]: species interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see the enormous potential of
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, you have a great collection
here, palm collection, the continent's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest palm herbarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told several people that I've met
that I started my journey with palms by
[SPEAKER_00]: working on some material that had been
sent by Dr. Natalie Ewell to the person
[SPEAKER_00]: who was my supervisor during my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell has always been a reference
collection, and it is a reference
[SPEAKER_00]: collection for all palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palm researchers in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to leave time for
questions, and thank you all for your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have time for a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thanks for giving us so much
to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a marvelous presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm going to ask you about the
beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not only the beautiful montane
system that you showed us, but also the
[SPEAKER_02]: peach palms, it makes me think a lot of
figs, because those trees are feeding so
[SPEAKER_02]: much biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're connecting the forest through
frugivores, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the focus on pollinator health in
this continent and in Europe is very
[SPEAKER_02]: bee-centric.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are thinking about bee management,
bee viruses, all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These beetles that pollinate your palms
are never regarded as important in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of their ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question for you is, unlike figs,
they don't live their entire lives inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the palm tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do these beetles live when they're
not pollinating your palms?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that part of the conservation
question as well, to preserve their
[SPEAKER_02]: habitat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we really liked our
results, because it shows the importance
[SPEAKER_00]: of congenerics, because we found in
several genera, Astrocharium included,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I didn't show results of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Astrocharium, when you have
different species of that genus living
[SPEAKER_00]: together, they keep the pollinator alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They share the main pollinator,
and they keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do need assemblages to keep your
main pollinator alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you can go and plant a
species away from its ecosystem and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollinator alive, because it takes a
village to raise a child, because it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: the congenerics that share that main
pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the case for Astrocharium,
for Terepe, for Cyroxenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: For back trees, it's a different group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Baridinae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another tribe, but it's still
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For palms, it's mostly beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly unknown beetles,
undescribed beetles, and miniature
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have just been disregarded,
and I think they're an asset, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: of forests that we should look more into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way they keep them alive is
there's spezialization, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators are not exclusive to one
species, so that they can share it around
[SPEAKER_00]: across the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be some standing diversity
to keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another reason why monocultures don't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's another reason why these
communities that have lived for thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years in the Amazon know that the best
way to get food is by growing or enriching
[SPEAKER_00]: their palm of interest within biodiverse
systems, because they'll get a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, and not by just extracting the one
species and multiplying it by the hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: and thousands, but by keeping it in a
managed biodiverse system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in the Northeast, when the settlers
came, it's estimated roughly 90% of our
[SPEAKER_03]: land was cleared for farming purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly now, it seems to have
recovered, for the most part, in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And currently, when we see some of these
successional lands, they're a monoculture
[SPEAKER_03]: of goldenrod.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, that plays an important
role in that succession.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to palms' role in natural
succession back to forests from disturbed
[SPEAKER_03]: lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you normally see for these canopy
palms, it's different from the understory
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see with the canopy palms
is when you have a high abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy palms, that usually coincides with
an early successional stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow faster than other trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they form these early forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the forest becomes more and
more mature, and the canopy becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: closed, and there's more shadow,
then palms become less abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will still have the same regional
pool of species, but in lower abundances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative abundances for each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So palms do play an important role in
producing biomass in those first early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the forest becomes more
mature, they become less and less
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant, but still remain in the regional
pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the goldenrod.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very opportunistic,
because they love light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an open corner in the forest is always
an opportunity to grow faster and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alejandra?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned the volcanism during the
Miocene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have the portion of the Peba
Sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think it has a role in the
diversification or the increase in highly
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse populations that you have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Peba system has been more studied
in terms of divergence, because it meant a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier for low elevation plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this volcanism was like,
we're studying it as a point of connection
[SPEAKER_00]: between mountain segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're within the same region,
but the Peba system is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast of where we're at with these
volcanic centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these volcanic centers are on top of
existing low topography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're acting upon mid-elevation land,
so already within the area of influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the Peba system was east of the
Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're similar in the way that
both can both certainly affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both certainly interesting,
because we can date them from different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives and see how the system comes
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the Peba system is specifically
interesting, because it left behind all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these species adapted to marshes and
seasonally flooded areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Mauritia and Manicaria and all of
these species that were left behind by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Peba system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Peba system was a marine incursion,
and it left behind all these swamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the marine incursion retracted
further north, but it left all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: swamp adapted species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny, because you're walking on
Tierra Firme in the Amazon, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding all these species that look like
they're coastal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's another example of how there are
signs of the past everywhere, if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to look for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I think we're going to have
to end the questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any other questions you'd like
to ask, come on up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget, there's a lunch with the
graduate students immediately now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
