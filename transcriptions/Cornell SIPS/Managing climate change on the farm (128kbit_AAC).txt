[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been very lucky on Fishkill Farms
not to have any severe effects from the
[SPEAKER_00]: big storms of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our neighbors have certainly had a lot
of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the river in Ulster County there
was tremendous damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not only from the Irene storm and
the hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also, there have been wind and hail
events throughout the last couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: that have periodically caused havoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the October snow storm knocked over a
lot of trees as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And broke a lot of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there have been quite a few events
that are quite severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing big swings on the
rainfall side as well between drought and
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonged periods of extremely heavy
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as an orchard we're very
vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our whole livelihood is on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a fruit farm, we have a lot of crop
that is dependent on the blossom occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right time, pollination,
not having severe hail events during the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of the fruit crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, there not being too much
wind during the final pre-harvest period
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the crop remains on the trees
until it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there's a tremendous risk
throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to mention diseases and all
the other downsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been lucky with the vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the reason that we produce multiple
successions of the same crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're marketing in the farmers markets
and locally here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And planting, you know, every two weeks
there's a new crop going in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that we're spreading our risk
quite dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some other bed shaping and
soil working techniques that seem to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: us getting into a situation where we can't
get into the land and produce a crop so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gradually planning to deal with
erratic weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing that we've done so far
is to put in an irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see around here the drip lines
that are laid on the ground with the small
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually succeeded last year in putting
in a system that has the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate the entire farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have all the blocks hooked up to
it and the drip tape laid down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also gradually putting in a trellis
system that will help support the small
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to a more dense format for the
orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have diversified water sources for our
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same reason that we have so much
rainfall variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do draw from a small creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several ponds and a couple of
wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to the irrigation using,
this now more affects the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetable operation, but we're using
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: To balance for example with the tomatoes
rather than having our entire tomato crop
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a portion of it in a
greenhouse to balance that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the first time this coming
year we will grow some small fruit in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a high tunnel looks a lot like a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a three season or even two
season but really a three season cover to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate number one temperature variation
and number two water or rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can make sure that the crop for
example with small fruit and cherries is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulate the water, the amount of water
that the crop gets and prevent,
[SPEAKER_00]: in so doing prevent the fungus problems
that one would ordinarily have with those
[SPEAKER_00]: cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a farming point of view I think
the most valuable information we could get
[SPEAKER_00]: from Cornell is on varieties that will be
adapted for the next 20 years of climatic
[SPEAKER_00]: variations that would be best adapted as
we're planting new blocks out every
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: An issue that is perhaps most critical in
the whole issue of adapting to climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and that is management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the choices of what you
plant and how you farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also improving management strategies
and keeping it closer control on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you do on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record keeping, being very precise about
one's activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that certainly our focus is how we
can manage with what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're producing a crop, a variety of crops
for a fabulous market in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of people who need to eat
and we're lucky with our location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're interested in doing is
adapting to whatever comes our way and
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure we can manage through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't feel like as one farm operation
we can necessarily influence the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather manage the effects that we're
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the question of whether climate
change is caused by human influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: human activity or not, we feel like that's
not a concern that we are going to address
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very much more interested in
addressing the effects of the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and what we can do to deal with it.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
