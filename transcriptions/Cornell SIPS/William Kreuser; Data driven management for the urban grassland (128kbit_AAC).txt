[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thanks Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I started at
Madison before I had my little hiatus on
[SPEAKER_00]: this topic for my three and a half years
here in Ithaca working with Frank and then
[SPEAKER_00]: research we've kind of picked back up at
Nebraska and it's something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: been pretty impactful to our turf industry
and so I'm really excited to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: share with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Nebraska, I have a three-way split.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an extension specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty percent of my time is extension and
then I have twenty percent teaching load
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thirty percent research load which I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People usually hate three-way splits but I
really do like doing all three aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: the job and from my extension side,
I really focus on how to become more
[SPEAKER_00]: precise managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, how are we making sure that
we're applying the right fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right amount of water, the right
products when it's needed and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of doing that is to harness data and
analyze data and to make decisions that
[SPEAKER_00]: are based on models and the latest
research so that we're not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting stuck in these calendar-based
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like in turf but also I know from
my time here and in a lot of our crops
[SPEAKER_00]: like apples, right, we have these spray
schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sit there and we spray every week or
two weeks because we can't tolerate any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of disease or any type of pest or in
a turf situation, grass has to look and
[SPEAKER_00]: perform well and so we're constantly
trying to balance our input so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass is looking good but it's not looking
too good and it's also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: free of any kind of disease or weed or
insect pests and so I'm really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk today about how do we use that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be kind of a high picture,
kind of a high view and I want to tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a story of how I've gotten
to this point where I started off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with that backyard putting green
and now I'm, you know, the CEO of a
[SPEAKER_00]: startup tech company and, you know,
it's quite a learning curve over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years to go from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kind of my challenge is in a turf
industry, I think the challenge of people
[SPEAKER_00]: like Frank and other extension specialists
and different crops are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of information out there
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media has been huge for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been able to grow my presence
in the turf industry and grab like 3,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter followers and they're all turf
people and it's a great way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there and when you have
all these people constantly putting
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there, there's a lot of
information that's new, things can get
[SPEAKER_00]: buried and so that can be kind of a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we gain better adoption
of our best major practices in agronomy or
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture when we have, you know,
good science, maybe bad science being
[SPEAKER_00]: spewed through different social media
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the challenges that I see
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge is we have all this data
we can collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we taking that data and those data
and we bring them together so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make quick decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time to spend 10 hours a day
trying to combine all these data and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to analyze them and then make a
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost get paralyzed by that data and
then also, you know, what's the return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment to spending all that time or to
buying the equipment or to paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: computer power to analyze all these data
so that we can then make decisions and so
[SPEAKER_00]: great, I can do GPS spray applications on
my golf course or on any kind of farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting a return either in
playability or from an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or from a time perspective and
so we really have to keep all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things in mind when we're trying to
understand what we can do as extension
[SPEAKER_00]: specialists to try to expand the reach of
our programming and we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies exploding too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 years ago, no golf courses had these
soil moisture probes and now everybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: them and they have an app now that this
probe can integrate with and then we have
[SPEAKER_00]: drones coming in the turf industry and
they can make pretty maps but they really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't still really tell you what to do
with the information that's on these
[SPEAKER_00]: different maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is thermal imaging, there's different
crop indices like NDVI or NDRE and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: have all these different disparate sources
of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my soil moisture map, I got my
thermal imaging map, I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: handwritten data from how fast the putting
greens are from where a cup might be cut
[SPEAKER_00]: on a putting green.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I combine all that information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's all screwed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard for a superintendent or
even a sports field manager to handle all
[SPEAKER_00]: that to then make clear decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a lot of weather models
and so this is from a website that
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan State does a nice job on,
growingtogreetattractor.net and they take
[SPEAKER_00]: different pest models and from this they
can understand, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenology and some of the different
timings and life cycles of different pests
[SPEAKER_00]: and different plants and give some
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is now another source of
information that a turf manager has to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate and actively seek out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're gonna continue to see
these models expand over time in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and I think across a lot of
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pest models have historically
been something that we've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: research on now for 30 or 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Frankie applied some research with
annual bluegrass, this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging weed that's making seed heads
and when would you spray or when would you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to see these seed heads from
occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some newer models for really
challenging diseases like dollar spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disease that can be pretty
problematic in our climate and some new
[SPEAKER_00]: models are predicting when that's going to
emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing some newer models though
away from the pest models for things like
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient use and growth potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I'm here today, we were talking in
Frank's office about golf courses now
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just keeping track of how many
clippings they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seems like something that you'd
think is kind of fundamental for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would know about how much grass is
being mowed because that's going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us how ability, its ability to kind of
handle traffic, how nutrients are being
[SPEAKER_00]: removed during that clipping being
removed, how sugar is being allocated
[SPEAKER_00]: within that plant and we're not really
even doing that and so that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity there and I think people are
starting to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about some of the
research that I started doing as a high
[SPEAKER_00]: school student and that's turned into what
I've been doing now and that's looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to use this as kind of the
backdrop or the context to the story that
[SPEAKER_00]: showed how I've kind of developed into
building this decision support tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant growth regulators are frequently
applied to highly maintained turf but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're also extremely difficult to
understand if they're working and because
[SPEAKER_00]: of that they're very frequently
misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the products that we're using
in turf inhibit gibberellum biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hormone causes our leaves to
elongate so the more gibberellum that's
[SPEAKER_00]: present, the faster the grass is grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure many here that have to mow
lawns probably would love to spray these
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth regulators on your grass
because you don't want to have to mow it
[SPEAKER_00]: as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what the thinking is
behind some of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the common ones, the most
common one is a particular product
[SPEAKER_00]: Knixipak Ethyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very safe plant growth regulator,
very minimal negative attributes
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have some other PGRs,
pathobuchazole and fluoroprimidol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are root absorb PGRs, a little bit
more phytotoxic in turf but still used
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might think well why am I
putting down something that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make my grass grow slower on a golf
course?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mow a green every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mow fairways two or three times a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the real benefit to these products
come from they reduce clipping yields
[SPEAKER_00]: which therefore reduce our nutrient
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also mowing less of that stored
carbohydrate off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see plant health benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an improved stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see enhancements in turf
playability and performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a denser stand of turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see an increase in green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into this research because of
this stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 15, I had that backyard putting
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of shade issues by trying to
suppress some of the phytochrome growth
[SPEAKER_00]: response from growing grass in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting these products down onto the
turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a high school kid I'm like how does
this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make sense out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a superintendent I worked for kind of
explained it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what I had drawn up for
how these products worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have relative clipping yield here on
the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how fast the grass would grow
if we did not apply a plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at day zero I put down my Primo
Max, my Trinx Back Ethyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that the clipping yields start
to grow slower and slower and slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see a 20% reduction in our
clipping yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, but enough to improve that
plant health and reduce that nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after about a week we saw it kind
of wear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the sugar that we'd stored
and all the benefits that we gained in
[SPEAKER_00]: this suppression phase then kind of get
burned later on in this rebound phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a buildup of gibberellin
precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once that PGR is gone, now those
precursors become active forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: gibberellin and the grass grows like crazy
and it burns through carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the plant health benefits we're
trying to see are lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd think okay it's pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you just have to just apply the
PGRs fairly frequently to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping yield suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid the rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might say I need to apply every
about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also say I just watch the grass
and when it starts to regrow maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just reapply the PGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is the absolute
clipping yields are all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we were talking about in
Frank's office before this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like mineralization of nitrogen,
water status, other environmental factors
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the absolute clipping yield to
fluctuate a lot from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the black line here is plots that are
treated or not treated with plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red lines are plots that were
treated with plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's times where we apply the
PGR and we had less clipping yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the PGR wears off and we see a little
bit of a rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we reapply the PGR and we have a
little more suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wears off and it's rebounding
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not maintaining that clipping
yield suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not maintaining all those plant
health benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore we shouldn't even waste our
money with these applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're like me growing grass in the
shade we're not really maximizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: health of that turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 2015 PGA championship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was volunteering there at Whistling
Straits going into that tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cool weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Friday before the tournament
week started they got three quarters of an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch of rain and then it got really warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a mineralization flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big increase in plant available
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see really, really rapid growth
during the week of the tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up using the models I'm going
to talk about in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew the PGRs were working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they weren't using those models,
they would say, hey, that PGR doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I waste my money on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed some kind of a model to help
guide these applications because our eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to really tell us if we're
getting clipping yield suppression or
[SPEAKER_00]: rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore are we getting these plant
health benefits or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at the PLAS research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before I started my research in
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that during the summertime we see
a reduction in the efficacy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, how long did it last?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that it lasted for pretty...
So if I wanted to visualize that curve I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed before, which would be in that blue
line when it's really hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about Ithaca heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average temperature would be 90
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a high of upper 90s lows
and the upper 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing at least seven days of growth
suppression out of these products like
[SPEAKER_00]: Primo Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we go to kind of weather like
we're having right now, or maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: colder than right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might get three weeks growth
suppression with that same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was something we did in early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got published in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now how do I get this into the hands
of our superintendents?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a challenge to me as an extension
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make this easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about a sine wave curve is a
really good way for people's eyes to wave
[SPEAKER_00]: over really, really quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanted to do was try to see if
there's just some kind of a way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can predict these timings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we applied a growing
degree day based approach to trying to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we could understand this skew and the
period of the sine wave based on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: degree day accumulation and get away from
thinking about things in calendar days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research was started in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of a novel way of
thinking about something, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it's not very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out, you spray your plant growth
regulators, and then you just collect
[SPEAKER_00]: clippings over and over and over every day
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're up to about 70,000 clippings
have been collected from this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have different PGRs, different
rates, different grass areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all you do is we just fit the
relative clipping yield to the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: degree data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, we can estimate what
our application intervals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first study was done with this
trinexopat cathode on bankgrass potting
[SPEAKER_00]: greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we followed, we applied as the
label said, every four weeks, that we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: apply the PGR and then we'd have
suppression and then it wear off and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get that rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very counterintuitive,
counterproductive, not helping the health
[SPEAKER_00]: of our plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd reapply suppression, rebound,
suppression, and then the starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur on that third application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously not what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we took all this data, instead of
plotting it as calendar day on the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did it as cumulative growing degree
days after application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is application at day zero and
then growing degree days, which is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: summation of the average air temperature
in degrees Celsius we use with a base of
[SPEAKER_00]: zero degrees Celsius, which is in grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested different bases and the base
zero had the greatest two to R squared
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we had confidence in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found that for about zero to 200
growing degree days after application,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had suppression and then from about
three to 800 growing degrees, we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on our research now,
say we'd apply it 230 or fewer growing
[SPEAKER_00]: degree days, we'd be able to maintain that
clipping yield suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be, if the average
temperature is 20 degrees, that's 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the average temperature is 10 degrees,
you got 20 day intervals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's being flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're applying these herbicides and
these plant protecting products based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the metabolism of the product and not just
based on what the label says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we applied PGRs every 200 growing
degree days, we had nice even clipping
[SPEAKER_00]: yield suppression averaging about 15% less
than the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was at or below the control for the
entire growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we saw an improvement in the
color and the quality and the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an improvement in things like shade
tolerance and heat tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that the application rate
didn't really affect the interval very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk about that today for
the lack of time, but if you go at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, instead of having 15% average
suppression, you might get 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing this now for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it for all these
different plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the table for one putting
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is creeping bench grass putting
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate range, so what the rate effect
would have on the amount of suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the ideal intervals would be in
growing degree days for all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a superintendent start mixing
products on me and they start asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what if I mix this product with that
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much suppression do I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it last?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some really challenging
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to figure it out yourself,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm taking all this data and I
can get it published and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the last step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last step is getting it into the hands
of our end users so that they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: use it to make decisions in how they're
applying their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a non-computer person, but a data
person as most of you guys are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you build Excel sheets like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pretty proud of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of if then statements in
there and looking up files and color code
[SPEAKER_00]: based on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the superintendent would come in,
pick their temperature unit, their active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, the rate they wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our models would kick in on the
backside, tell them what their ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree day interval should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they wanted to make their own,
they could even set their own interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would come in and they could
pick the days they applied the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would tell them what their
cumulative growing degree days were and
[SPEAKER_00]: their approximate levels of clipping yield
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would warn them when they need
to reapply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even did some extra if thens in there so
you can even put in the forecast weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can say, oh, maybe I have to
reapply on this date, even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: currently a week away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked really well for Bencraft
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some challenges there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question someone asked was,
well, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really bad at sprayer math.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you help me out with the sprayer
math?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to another sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have them put in the area that
they want to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sprayer set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many gallons of water are they going
to put over an acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what products do they want to
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start building all this into
Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put it out there on your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people start downloading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is new versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I get new model data and I
need to add something to it, I can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: easily go off to everybody and say,
hey, here's the new version of the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stop using the old one and use
the new one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was always an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem was bugs and more
typically user problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could imagine if you had a cell that's
got like five if then statements in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and someone clicks the wrong cell,
and then they send it to you and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you fix this for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their problem too is they had to manually
enter their weather data over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do some of the kind of the
functional problems with an Excel type of
[SPEAKER_00]: an approach to using these different types
of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Cornell's got some great models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Excel based for things like soil
test interpretations and mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really good, but they can be a
little bit intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for me, I think I should know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still look at it and go like,
okay, how do I do this the right way?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a bigger picture perspective though,
as an extension educator, I'm constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: asked about, how do you document this kind
of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you document your impact instead of
just saying like, well, it was downloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are 400 people actually using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they actually implementing the
recommendations based on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just downloaded it once and then
threw it out because they didn't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another problem that we have
an extension as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we document what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we write a publication about how we
should do something, but then we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really, and they can count how many times
it's downloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know if people are actually
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting a change in practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we needed some way that was more
interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very one sided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They choose to use it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want something that I give out to them,
they can use, but then as they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's coming back to me so that I can
understand how are they using these
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they implementing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways I could evolve my
research to meet some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're giving me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I needed some more communication
through my extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became pretty clear to me,
and this actually came clear to me at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my good friends, Ian Small,
was a plant pathology student working in
[SPEAKER_00]: decision support tool in Bill Fry's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got this idea for one
for turf too, for these plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh, that's cool,
Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I left Cornell and now I'm a
professor and I have a startup package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I want to put some money
into actually trying to build an app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really intimidating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because none of us have background in
really software design and it's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: language and something that we're just not
really comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you're thinking about
is you got to find developers that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Lincoln, we're having this surge
of, they call it the Silicon Prairie now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these companies are coming from
Silicon Valley to cheap Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wealth of student, new
graduates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to find even developers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay a lot of money, like 200 grand
to build an app and it might be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you miss the market or anything,
well then you got to redevelop it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be $200,000 to get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can do what I do and you hire some
cheaper small firm and they take forever
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a couple of years to kind of
get things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding support was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I did is I went to my
department head and said, Iris idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you help me with that initial startup
cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start making money on it,
I'll pay you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't make money on it, then I guess
you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a lot of risk for him, but he still
said it's a good enough idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Design considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is huge when building an app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on your phone right now,
I'm sure you're realizing if the app is
[SPEAKER_00]: not intuitive and easy, you're not going
to use it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And only you know how a grower is going to
use this type of technology because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work with them in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they don't want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: An app guy, my first attempt at this,
they did it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hideous and ugly and
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have to come in and every time we
do variants, I draw up in PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it has to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time, but you save time and money
later on because you're not redoing their
[SPEAKER_00]: initial attempt, which usually is nowhere
near what an end user would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you spend all this money,
you're on the hook, and now you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how am I going to advertise it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to get adoption?
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefit there is having that big
Twitter following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you build something that works,
you get this good word of mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in a tight-knit community like
the turf industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've seen really nice adoption of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not Greenkeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I did for my interview,
though, at Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came in right away and said this is
what I want to build when I get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I drew this up right before my
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it had things like my record
keeper, the weather forecast, and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And online resources that link to our
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to display things like what
products were applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can keep tracking my PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm tracking my PGRs, I can also
track fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can track fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can track water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just kind of became intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I know someone's spraying a lot of
fungicide, for example, now I can start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing where they are and start building
maps to understand, oh, maybe we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of dollar spot outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can also start tracking my PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what my PGRs are.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're going to build out
for the rest of the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to move away from the green street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're ever going to build an app,
make sure it's really like a native app
[SPEAKER_00]: for your phone or just call it
Greenkeeper, which is the way I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that domain was not
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greenkeeper app is where it's at right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can access it through your
internet browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: One nice thing about this is think about
your growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to see it on their
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might see it on a tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be doing a lot of data entry on
their computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing a web-based app, now they have
a lot more flexibility in how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can see it and access their data
at any location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it really looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the app side, we call this front end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Front end makes things look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guys love doing the back end stuff,
figuring out the algorithms, figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hate front end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hire someone to make it look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're finding from our
superintendents is they love it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ugly, but it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see what's been applied to their
greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can watch the products expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see how they've been fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll down, they can look at the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get reminders when things come out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Websites, if you're looking, if you're
looking to ever do any website analytics
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how many people are using your
site, one thing people want is a low
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called their bounce rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bounce rate means you go onto the website
and then you want someone to stick there
[SPEAKER_00]: and click around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want them to log onto your site
and say, I don't need anything here and
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I want a decent bounce rate
because I want my superintendents to log
[SPEAKER_00]: in every day, look at the homepage and go,
I'm pretty good today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go on and do something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a good thing to have
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to know what the goal of the
app is and what your clients need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our PGR display is real easy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app already keeps track of 570
variants of those growing ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to know all of the ins
and outs of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It automatically grabs weather data every
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be $600 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We switched it over to a different
provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's 50 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's automatically getting
the weather data and the 10 day forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these PGRs, for example,
this one trim it, package butchers all,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was spraying for was a PGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day I sprayed, the day is likely to
expire based on the forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it really has expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of growing degree days that
we're at versus what our goal
[SPEAKER_00]: reapplication interval was and then how
much suppression or rebound that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this treatment is starting to go from
suppression into rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this Primo Max on the T's is still
not yet expired and it's going to expire,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, several weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quick, superintendent looks at it
and go, oh, I'm going to spray next
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw the Primo in the tank then they
go on with their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quick and it's easy and all the data
is in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also expanded it to do things like
the sprayer mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they struggle with math.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just come in now and they pick,
I'm treating my greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells them how many tanks, how many
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come in, they pick the
products they want to use, the rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pests, the interval they'd like to use
if it's not based on growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives them a nice list of how much
product is needed to make some full tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make partial tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps track of all this inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really so simple for a
superintendent to then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have that and they push the finalized mix,
they get a PDF, they can print off,
[SPEAKER_00]: they give it off to a spray tech or an
intern and they mix it up and there's less
[SPEAKER_00]: chance for a math error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right there, we can have a big
impact by trying to minimize some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: math errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The onus comes on to me though for that
math to be right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to do a lot of, we call it QA,
quality assurance to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you do different models so you
make sure your math is working the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of the big features of
Greenkeeper initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the last two years,
we've gone from zero to 3,800 courses,
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,900 users, multiple users can be shared
at one course and we've tracked 89,000
[SPEAKER_00]: different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm talking about extension
impacts now, that's my impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show who's using it, how it's being
used, how often they're logging in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more importantly right here,
products being tracked, I can see how are
[SPEAKER_00]: they using this PGR on fairways?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they using this PGR on greens?
[SPEAKER_00]: What rates are they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What intervals do they like?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden now, I can document my
impact to my extension Dean to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: my research is being applied directly to
growers and they're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something you get when you
develop an app like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Google Analytics is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, you know, we're doing about
1.7 thousand logins a month from our
[SPEAKER_00]: different users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a bunch of users that try
it out, but these are kind of our monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: active users, 1.7 or 1,700 users,
which is really, really great amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption through the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our users are highly engaged, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give us amazing testimonials like
Bill Keane here, you know, with
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenkeeper I've made five fewer PGR apps
to my greens and two fewer to my fairways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real savings and products later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way you can really document your
impact if you're an extension specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem trade-off there is they
give you a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel invested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna tell you what they want,
what they like, what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all kind of being added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great because then you do what
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell their buddies about how they,
you know, that they had the idea for this
[SPEAKER_00]: and we did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's continuing to make this decision
support tool grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about developing a
tool like this, the most important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember to make it successful is that
need to offer your end users more value
[SPEAKER_00]: and time and money than they put into the
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of apps out there where they
want you to enter all this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything, but they don't
really give anything back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This app has given you so much information
back with past models and fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking, fertilizer recommendations,
these PGR models that can be complex for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right there and it's
automatically updating for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's worth their time to then give
you all their sprayer information to
[SPEAKER_00]: assess your impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like this new dollar spot
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, make it real simple so that we have
all their areas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a stress disease threshold there,
risk threshold, so they can look at some
[SPEAKER_00]: really complex model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It automatically tells them not the
number, just are they protected or at
[SPEAKER_00]: risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Real simple, real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consults with what fungicides have been
sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a fungicide had been sprayed on these
BAC9Ts and the threshold was above 20%,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just say protected because you're
still protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the growers need to know, oh,
that fungicide protects against this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, it's automatically right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another like pet peeve of mine is soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do modeling and trying to understand
what the soil phosphorus, potassium levels
[SPEAKER_00]: are for maintaining our turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you look at soil test reports
from labs and they're going to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, your molybdenum is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your molybdenum is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no research to support that
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we said, okay, well, we can do
soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do tissue testing in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just pick where you're sampled from
and know what's about your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give a little barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send it off to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, we get the important
things, soil pH, buffer pH, organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, malix 3, malix phosphorus,
malix potassium, the things that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we give university
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing like a salt test on
sand and you think your sodium is high,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just says interpretation is not
applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have defoculation of clay,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other labs would try to scare you and tell
you, you got to pull these products down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can just pump university
recommendations right into a tool and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do like 20 bucks for a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Independent soils consultants can charge
you $100 for a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can just kind of cut some of
that right out of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some growing pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the university came to us and said,
Bill, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to form an LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had the support and the
protection of the big university behind
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's pretty low risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here has ever done a SWOT analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, threats, universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, we don't have SWOT analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, when you're, you have protection
behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a private industry, you better
know those, you know, your, your
[SPEAKER_00]: weaknesses and your threats really
clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little bit scared about that,
but they said, first of all, you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: money and university is not a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're collecting credit cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: State law in Nebraska says we cannot store
credit card information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have all the university
constraints about user agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you use the logo and all this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to form an LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Cornell alumni, my master's
advisor, Doug Soldat and I formed our turf
[SPEAKER_00]: grade LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we pay a small royalty to our
revenue to Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem comes up then is now we
have all these ideas of how to be funded,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free app.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want stuff for free online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for some reason, people think they
don't have to pay for stuff online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different, there's different
models out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us to kind of make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, looking for partnerships,
looking at ways to grow the Greenkeeper
[SPEAKER_00]: app and so develop rapidly because there's
other apps out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not developing, then we're
going to have some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, just the challenges of
trying to run a small growing startup on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of having a three way appointment as a
professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the challenges that
I've been trying to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The university is very supportive of this
because they are getting some royalty
[SPEAKER_00]: money out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just some of the issues that I'm
having.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about developing an
app and it's successful, these are some
[SPEAKER_00]: real things that come along a couple of
years later that are going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smack you in the face and you have to be
kind of aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I kind of wrap up though, I wanted to
show, you know, where is the app going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much, it's going to be much broader
than the things I've showed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not doing much PGR
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what now we're doing, we're getting
into GPS frayers, variable rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors, you know, the big thing in egg
crops, the sensors on drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't need that in turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we take a drone over our grass
every day, every three days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got an active sensor connected to
a battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have really nice crop
monitoring, crop scouting technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: just sitting on the back of a mower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that, we can look at water
status and disease and nitrogen status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is some of the data that we've
been collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a different fairway over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the stress starts picking
up in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to start looking at that and
modeling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the research that we're doing
now is getting pumped right back into our
[SPEAKER_00]: green keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to balance, you know,
our research to make sure we're sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: the needs that we need for precision turf
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the things I think
we're really excited about going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to use a sensor on a
mower, you can always use it on a Segway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our GIS guys who's,
you know, he's also a pilot, but he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: his Holland Scientific ACS430 crop sensor
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just driving a putting green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, you know, he can learn a
lot about, you know, how that putting
[SPEAKER_00]: green grass is performing, how nitrogen is
performing at the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, you know,
I want green keeper to look something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a Google Earth overlay
of the different fairways here at this Jim
[SPEAKER_00]: Eger golf course is a golf course that I
kind of took over from the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our students now take care of us is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your students are taking care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting real world experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can use as a research test
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're looking at, you know,
making GPS, variable rate and applications
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to even out some of these
differences in the chlorophyll content of
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's a pretty cool
opportunity to have that in Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to go long because Katie
and I both remember sitting at then
[SPEAKER_00]: seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go way over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap up here because I
know you guys probably want to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about decision support
tools and extension, I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to engage your growers and to expand
your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting it two sided, not just,
you know, providing information and just
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping and praying that they're actually
using what you're telling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of opportunities out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turf, but a lot of especially are
highly maintained specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of applications being
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of data could be being collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's applications in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples, grapes, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is doing hop stuff now in Nebraska
and just keeping track of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, downy mildew pressure
applications, fertility, drip lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: ET, a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could build these types of interfaces
for lots of different crops out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for us to integrate our
science in a way that's intuitive and
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to our growers and something that
they want to engage in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you can go from zero users
to, you know, 3,800 golf courses in two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perspective, there's about 12,500 pretty
nicely maintained golf courses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to have about a quarter of
those, you know, maintained golf courses
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of takes up the 3,000 mom and
pops that, you know, are barely solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a pretty massive amount of
integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just by using our data and
putting it in a way that's intuitive and
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for having me
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to entertain any questions
now or, you know, after 1-10 somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about, you know, keeping the
competitive edge and that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: competition out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you comment on what you see as
competition in the turf industry right
now?
[SPEAKER_05]: For these, for this type of information
and applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, I wondered if you have many
or any non-golf course users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the first, actually the second
question first, that's we have the sports
[SPEAKER_00]: turf people are using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have athletic fields built in
as an area type within Greenkeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the ground ingredient models for
sports turf is also in Greenkeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess from a competition perspective,
there's different apps out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch like on-link and
playbooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are keeping track of
apps, but it's different from us versus
[SPEAKER_00]: them is we're giving them the user's
information back by having those models in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those 570 models, I haven't
published because I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they just can't put it into
their apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest threat right now for
us is a lot of apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of like drone technologies
and sensor technologies for soil moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing partnerships happen
really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's going to be the one
thing we look at is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: making us constantly assessing how those
partnerships are forming and looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a business perspective now that it's
an LLC and not just a university app.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any more from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your screen up there says protected
from dollar spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when the golf course does
get dollar spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back to that, they could
actually pick their threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you'd say then is,
okay, maybe you have a weaker cultivar of
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to go to lower action
thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the way we kind of make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, too, when they put in their
interval for how long those fungicides
[SPEAKER_00]: last, if they know it's really high
pressure, don't put a 28-day interval if
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's going to last 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: My counterpart in Wisconsin, too,
is trying to take some of this growing
[SPEAKER_00]: degree day type environmental degradation
modeling research and applying it to
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides and other types of control
products, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can try to put this together with
other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger challenge there is PGRs are
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the PGR is gone, it starts to
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungicides gone from the plant tissue,
it still may be having an impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's going to be a lot more
dynamic there when you're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant residual and the pest response to
that critical dose of that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more challenging than
the PGR, which is a pretty easy way.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two quick questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is, do you have evaluation built into
the app?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second is, is there any way
to track from these users, gee,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to reduce my pesticide or my
fungicide would ever use over time,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I would think would give you a
really good market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing we don't have yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about is we can pool
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can look at how their number is
either an active ingredient has been
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced or their EIQ or whatever metric
that you want to use to assess the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can rate, how has my number
changed over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, maybe more helpful
is, how are you doing relative to your
[SPEAKER_00]: peers in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now if you're looking like,
well, I'm really high and I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and they're really low,
what are they doing differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I change my management?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that would be one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on that right now with
some of the new algorithms from a price
[SPEAKER_00]: and a use perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your first question was, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evaluation is not built in yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just running through like survey
monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting a lot of feedback
through just looking at how the products
[SPEAKER_00]: are being used in different regions too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't even have to use their bias
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at their actual product use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can say they're good,
but I see, you know, their low use at this
[SPEAKER_00]: golf course may be very different than
that golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes there can be some bias in
how to answer those surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that in the survey monkeys,
so we get a lot of that too, but we find
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're both equally effective,
but kind of from different angles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing what you've done in such a
short period of time, since I still
[SPEAKER_02]: remember you as a grad student.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to find out what you think the
future of extension is at migrant
[SPEAKER_02]: universities 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what you're doing, I really think
you should be expanded further.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, what the bottleneck is,
is that, for example, you had to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: another firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of us have to work with
programmers, individual programmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that process, I believe,
is the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think at land-grant
universities, we should have our own in
[SPEAKER_02]: extension, our own programmers,
like a data science core that's
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically working with us to get these
ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension isn't writing just articles
anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing podcasts like Frank does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do videos now where it's building apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need the infrastructure at
universities to produce a diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep pushing my department head to say,
we need a podcast booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can go in with good microphones,
and it's soundproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not me in an echoey office with a
fan blowing on from the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's definitely
something that would make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to go internal with the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of dysfunction within that
world, I had to go external and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think having those resources would
make extension a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finding ways to fund ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be getting a lot of
federal funding anymore or state funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing things like this, money now is
going directly back into my program to
[SPEAKER_00]: support extension, to support research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finding revenue models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the challenges,
though, is that's what our university is
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually the poster child of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me to start an LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it directly finances me and helps me
out as a company owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the university gets some royalty back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they need to have some better way of
figuring out how to raise money in
[SPEAKER_00]: extension so we can build these tools and
not just charge for downloads of some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a neb guide or some kind of a pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these tools are really some
way where we can actually make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money selling decision support tools and
taking our brains and helping our growers
[SPEAKER_00]: make the right decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a good ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
