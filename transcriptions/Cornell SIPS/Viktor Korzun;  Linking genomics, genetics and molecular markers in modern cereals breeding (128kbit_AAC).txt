[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also my extraordinary honor to
be here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would explain to you later on in one
slide why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please wait for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to start my presentation with
contents online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go through a short introduction,
which is mainly, there will be a few
[SPEAKER_03]: slides about KWS, because I think not all
of you are familiar with this company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one slide about myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will go very shortly, because I
think all of you are aware about the
[SPEAKER_03]: global trends in agriculture changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will take this specific example in
our very strong breeding program in
[SPEAKER_03]: Vienna, Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk about modern breeding
technology, and I will give you example of
[SPEAKER_03]: successful application for all three
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with KWS.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are quite old company.
[SPEAKER_03]: 162 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the history started here in small
village with name, near Magdeburg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magdeburg have excellent soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the story was following.
[SPEAKER_03]: One part of the family bought the sugar
beet factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And second mention, if we are start to
make sugar beet business, we need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: the selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And selection was started before Mendel
describes the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will show you later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then was convert and new started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: 1945.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody know what is the date?
[SPEAKER_03]: 1945.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they became on the Russian
part, and the British bank was involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: company, they decided to take part of Gem
Plus, part of West part of Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: and to have new start in Einbeck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will show you one slide in Einbeck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Einbeck is not only the company,
this is one of the oldest brewery in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 900 years history, because the
name of Einbeck in middle age was Einbock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And balk beer is very, very familiar,
at least in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have couple of changes today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of leading company in plant
breeding, and we are about 70 country
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here where we are operated, this is
Einbeck, orange everything, which is our
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding station, and green where we make
the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three, now it's four, business
units.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 20 years here in Searows working
with wheat, rye, and barley.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have sugar beet and potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make always a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything what is growing underground
business units.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sugar beet is historical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have maize and salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything supports through research and
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be very clear, for us, a research
and development also including breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding our main innovative research and
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are also supporting our breeding
with all new technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, I will tell you exactly what
I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our headquarter here, here we are in
Einbeck.
[SPEAKER_03]: All facility you could see here is the KWS
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put it our, change our cup now
famous with our KWS logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already mentioned to you, I will give
one slide about myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark already mentioned I did my PhD in
Institute of Genetics and Statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Belarus, then I moved to Leibniz
Institute, Plant Genetics and Crop
[SPEAKER_03]: Research in EPK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is quite unique Institute because
they keep after reunification on Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is unique of Institute because
this is one of the strongest and one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest gene bank, but also five
different other department include
[SPEAKER_03]: Molecular Biology, including Plant
Breeding, a couple of us, a really unique
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of research going there in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then my second scientific home,
and I'm really proud, John Innes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have very healthy competition Mark
always is Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on I show you because I was with
Mike Gale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And them as Mark already mentioned,
I was for 20 years the head of breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: technology, not head breeding,
head of breeding technology at KWS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I moved from May 1st to Global Lead
Scientific Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is document I promised to show you
because if you look at 1997, and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: was invitation by Susan, I think he was
assistant professor in this time for my
[SPEAKER_03]: first seminar here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mean for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have really more than 20 years of
relation to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a relation is very,
very positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really proud to be again here in
your facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going very shortly on the global trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I divide here on population growth and
food security, climate change,
[SPEAKER_03]: and after local conditions and stability,
more is with less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I think all of you know about the
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me is in general, this is very
important because we are expected to have
[SPEAKER_03]: the reduction of agriculture area per
capita about 0.2 hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mean we need to produce not only
the best quality, but also amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: product we could feed the growing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is around all us because the
difference between animals breeding and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding is very obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working on plant breeding always
with different environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you could learn from this slide,
you see that we have surprisingly
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing of precipitation by five,
seven percent until 2000 hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the distribution is became very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, probably not all of you aware
this Europe and specifically Germany have
[SPEAKER_03]: very horrible year.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year drought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never expected such kind of drought as
we have this year in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some farmers specifically on light
salt in this part of Germany, not sent
[SPEAKER_03]: combined to harvest canola wraps,
because the yield was just 30% of expected
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And going to the next factor, which is
global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, here we expected to have increased
2.5 or 4.1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this will be mean for us
depending on the different region of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking on that, that's one centigrade
of global warming to mean to shift of the
[SPEAKER_03]: zone of climatic from 100 to 500
kilometers forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what mean again for South of
France, more drought, more water use
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiency variety should be all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potential good situation for East Europe
or Russian Siberia where the good
[SPEAKER_03]: potential for the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last one, third one here is,
and I think it's not only Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: but everywhere on the world, we need to
look on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is produce the same amount at
least with less water, less nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: less pesticide, and only the solution for
us to keep biodiversity on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to put here is the factor which is
we are expected to target as essentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from right side, our response from
breeding point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could look by yourself,
for example, for temperature areas,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, heat tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will found here is, for example,
root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 20 years ago, a nice interaction
with breeder, one of the famous our body
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he mentioned, I not care this is came
from roots or from leaves as
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I measure as plot and I measure the
leaves, sorry, yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now he came in back and mentioned you
was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need now to dissect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to know this from variety A,
I have 5% more yield because it's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know from variety B, I have 5% more
yield because nice photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because them I could combine in more
precise way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about current breeding targets,
example of our German wheat breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is in one slide, a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most important for you, the area of
growth of wheat 3.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I am talking about West Europe,
the biggest wheat, winter wheat,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm talking about mainly about winter
wheat area is in France with 5 million,
[SPEAKER_03]: followed by Germany 3.2 and about 2
million in UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is make totally invest Europe about
10 million of winter wheat growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about number of listed
variety because the difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: United States and Europe, for example,
we need to have official registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, farmers have a choice from 140
different variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also not easy choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're farmers, how you to select is
the best one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what has happened in 91, we have 61.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1970, we have only 38 varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if you look here and it's quite
interesting, five biggest variety have in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1970, about 80% of acreage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's only 33.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the percentage of certified
seeds, and this is important for us as
[SPEAKER_03]: investors, 48%, which is mean only second
farmers buy certified seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers pushing us and mentioned we
need to increase the yield, we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: increase the resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we ask, are you buying certified seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: They mentioned not every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next how we could to create new
innovation without having money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in some East European country,
the situation is completely different in
[SPEAKER_03]: form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers have been teaching by lessons
is sufficient to buy the seeds once in
[SPEAKER_03]: your professional life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also some part of motivation
probably for you understanding why as a
[SPEAKER_03]: company thinking about to have hybrid
wheat or hybrid barley to have potential
[SPEAKER_03]: to return the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this also could be the political
solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in a neighbor country of
Germany, in Germany still is okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: 50%, but neighbor country, Denmark,
have about 62% because farmers believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that's good quality of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look on this graph, and this is nice half
for discussion because some people
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned we have fully stagnation of the
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a graph showing 1980 till 2080.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not put as a yield this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume we will be somewhere here
because extremely enormous drought.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look on the graph, it's
increasing of the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about the yield about seven
to eight ton of, and this is industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: way of producing of wheat in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look on the map of the Germany,
I'm from low Saxony, another, our capital
[SPEAKER_03]: is Berlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will recognize is overage yield is
here showing on different countryside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will find some of them, which is very
high, about nine ton, but you will have
[SPEAKER_03]: eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will hear here, this is east,
more soil, more light soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, here is south and south heat
because heat by flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm talking about the heat,
it's a different, how it's called,
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation from different growing
region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because heat here meaning the difference
about 10% of the yield because during
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering time, here is much higher
temperature, which is half negative
[SPEAKER_03]: influence on the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And knowing that, we could increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I move to very basic breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think most of you very familiar with
that because we need to have two crucial
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Variation, if you don't have variation in
one or the other way, we could close our
[SPEAKER_03]: activity and then selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, genetic resources is our basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my couple of example of excellent
application, I will show you the very
[SPEAKER_03]: positive example of using genetic
resources for improving quality or yield
[SPEAKER_03]: of variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be aware, majority of the breeder also
not use genetic resources every year
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a really hard job to cross
from genetic resources to achieve them the
[SPEAKER_03]: same level of yield specifically and
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one in my example for wheat,
I will show you what the reason for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have the crossing, evaluation,
couple of years at least, places,
[SPEAKER_03]: replication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm talking about the places,
it's also very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already mentioned in Europe,
we have three program, UK, France and
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in UK, we testing material in
only two location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone know the reason for?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Germany on 70 location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any idea why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Different climatic condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: In UK, the major area of wheat growing is
closer to Cambridge Norfolk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where is our two testing
location, station and location.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany, you have seen the map and the
condition, environment condition is very
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to provide for official testing
and specifically for farmers, verify
[SPEAKER_03]: information, we need to have more location
in continental.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with replication, I think is with
help of John Luke and many other
[SPEAKER_03]: statistician, we remove three replication.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are happy now with two because the
tools help us with resistance,
[SPEAKER_03]: yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will come back to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Official testing, three years in Germany,
two in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this take again, six to eight year
variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is eight to 12 years post.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes I mentioned this is like a
Russian roulette.
[SPEAKER_03]: You play gamble and you hope you have the
biggest variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be like examination because this
is a formula you should know all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: if you aren't a plant reader.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our genetic gain, which is
selection intensivity, genetic standard
[SPEAKER_03]: definition and generation interval.
[SPEAKER_03]: To interpret very simple work to make the
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intensivity, bigger is better,
but you know the bigger also costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you increase your program double,
you will have double possibility for
[SPEAKER_03]: success, but it will be double expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to find the option.
[SPEAKER_03]: Accuracy is very good related,
positive related variance as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also what specifically I like to point
it in this case is interval time.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be quicker, you are successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not only related this plant
breeding, but also related with other type
[SPEAKER_03]: of industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to relax you a little bit,
I will explain here a joke about the
[SPEAKER_03]: interval time because a board of some
other company, which is mainly related
[SPEAKER_03]: with chemistry, ask plant breeder wheat,
for example, Mark, how long it take for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to develop the variety of wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it be a double budget for you to make
double amount of money, would you able to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: This was exactly the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in some chemistry, if you develop
pharmacy, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put more money in beginning,
you expect to have shorter, but this is
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really proud because our board
still understood and understood in
[SPEAKER_03]: positive sense, plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really good to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking on that, I give you a little bit
about wheat, what we are target for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, yield, yield, yield,
but also quality, resistance, agronomic
[SPEAKER_03]: trace, specifically yield stability
because farmers like to have not every
[SPEAKER_03]: year, they like not only one yield,
the highest yield, stable yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we are looking also nitrogen,
because you may know in you, we have
[SPEAKER_03]: special directive for application of
nitrogen, reduction of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you compare wheat breeding program
with iceberg, this is only upper part of
[SPEAKER_03]: iceberg.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go deeply, this is what we are
selecting for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is make, at least my opinion,
John Luke, please confirm me the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference between maize breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in maize breeding, it was always
yield, yield, yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's became some disease important,
nitrogen is important, but looking on
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat, we have really huge amount of
trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very, very different,
okay, between different country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on, I show you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before to give, because probably not
all of you have been inside already Mark
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat breeding program, or at least Bali
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have here a couple of slides to give you
to bring you a little bit in the field
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a crossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this is a crossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a lot of young and old,
some of them very happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could admit I also could cross
wheat, but I have my difficulty to cross
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar beet because this is a really small
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next one, you could see this is
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably you don't know,
we use this for cover through the winter
[SPEAKER_03]: for the age, because the age is still
quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a really, really powerful
tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very efficient to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this started selection,
you will see small plots as breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some breeders use only a couple of seconds
to go to make the easy selection,
[SPEAKER_03]: a long shot and some disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeder will be unhappy if it is no
disease on the breeders side, because this
[SPEAKER_03]: gives possibility for selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, sometimes I'm sorry,
Mark, misinterpret the job of the
[SPEAKER_03]: successful breeder, meaning the job of the
breeders to remove 90% of the material
[SPEAKER_03]: from one generation to the other
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's the difference between
successful breeder and unsuccessful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Successful breeder keep 10% the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unsuccessful breeder removes the 10% or
part of them the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is most important for us because
here will be combined and combined will be
[SPEAKER_03]: measure everything for you, make mistake
or not make, because here side by side
[SPEAKER_03]: comparison of the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned in Germany, we have 17
location to test the yield because the
[SPEAKER_03]: condition is very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this slide will be interesting for
you, because look on a farmer's field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's also one hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers use about eight hours for wheat
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: For breeding field, we use 600 working
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's make big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned that I would explain you a
little bit about our three program in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is our UK program based in Cambridge
or three block closer to Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, Germany 3.2, France 5.1,
UK closer to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This related, but they're not overlapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could not make a breeding from UK for
full Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could make partly and you see here
overlapping for North of Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the condition and target is in UK
to have very short plant type,
[SPEAKER_03]: RHT1 for example, yellow frost,
white sowing windows.
[SPEAKER_03]: In UK, we could sow in December,
shortly before Christmas, winter wheat
[SPEAKER_03]: still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Germany, we could do not that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Germany, we need to have at least a
little bit winter harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for France, it's extremely important
to have PBS quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would explain you in next one,
because again, three country you have seen
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: In UK, I think some of you know the
quality of the bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have comment on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany, we have different type of
bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in France, you should have at least
baguette quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other case, your best successful variety
will be not for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have the quality in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, BP is 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: BPS is bread, 69%.
[SPEAKER_03]: In UK, divided through discrete type and
mixed type or feed type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you see the majority is going to feed
type.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany, here is export wheat is the
highest level of protein, about 8%.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most famous is 49%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is A quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mean all breeders like to feed the
best variety in A, because it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern breeding technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already mentioned to you that this
company started here, KWS Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was cross breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then corn breeding, maize breeding,
hybrid breeding started here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on, we have the same on rye hybrid
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I specifically show you a little bit
in detail, hybrid rye breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in tissue culture, here is molecular
marker area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Susan, you was pioneer on the
rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: First map, I was pioneer on first
Cicali-Cereale rye map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was area 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope this is molecular marker we will
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make the help, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have big potential on
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart breeding, you could term on
different way, genomic research,
[SPEAKER_03]: and here also genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenotyping, genome editing, I will be put
it also somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is still the question,
what will be the next?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will be really happy to have from
you, specifically from young generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: what will be our next step on fun
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But going here, double upload cell
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really, really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are happy on two different level.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, as this is not the secret,
all our barley program and not only all
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of breeders operated in Europe
based on microspore culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's very easy, it's really
efficient methodologies for microspore
[SPEAKER_03]: culture to make not expensive adage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is make easy for selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, microspore culture till
now, not perfectly working on wheat,
[SPEAKER_03]: is still very high independence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are very lucky to use underculture,
for example, which is give good potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both microspore culture and
underculture doesn't work for rye at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have couple of ideas related
with open pollinated, with little gene
[SPEAKER_03]: behind of, because homozygotic for rye
probably this is a kill, but this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothesis we need to verify.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then with marker assisted selection,
I already mentioned as this is not doubt
[SPEAKER_03]: that marker is help us a lot, or
specifically for targeted of very
[SPEAKER_03]: important genes or allelic variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And genomic selection, I don't need to go
in any details here, because I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: are one of the pioneer for application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really very thankful for you,
Mark specifically, John Luke for you
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically, to help us to create ideas
to help us with implementation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I specifically put here the slide with new
breeding technology, meaning gene editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I not use wheat specifically,
I put sunflower here, I like this picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, you put red here the
possibility to create alternative allelic
[SPEAKER_03]: variation for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was big hope for us in worldwide,
but also in Europe, but what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: AUG is staying for high level European
core.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem with this, all decision
was made, not only CRISPR-Cas gene editing
[SPEAKER_03]: technology considered, but also all
classical method of creating inducible
[SPEAKER_03]: mutation should be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only exception was done, exception meaning
here, all product which is already exist
[SPEAKER_03]: should be not, because this is could be
put on the danger our shelf and the mark
[SPEAKER_03]: will be half empty, because a lot of
mutation breeding, radiation mutation was
[SPEAKER_03]: done in early 60s.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Bali, for example, our traditional
German beer probably would be not produced
[SPEAKER_03]: because this variety was mutated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is decision is we need to
accept this decision because this is
[SPEAKER_03]: highest level of the core.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to think what the solution could
be, what's the other possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would give you very short, very quick
now, a few example of successful and very
[SPEAKER_03]: shortly for comment for this slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very important to have these
kilos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gen plus efficiency through genomic
selection or other method of optimization
[SPEAKER_03]: your breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should have the trade elements,
I would not mention only phrase as sources
[SPEAKER_03]: of GM or gene editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also for us, and I give the example is
roots, very important to understood what
[SPEAKER_03]: is behind of leg books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And enabling technology, because I think
is technology is also moving process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not go in detail to comment what we
have here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may look here, I'm talking about
precision farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talking about biologicals, which is may
have potential and we're looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: because again, the directive of Europe,
European Union to reduce the pesticide
[SPEAKER_03]: which is positive for environment,
but we need to have the alternative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Latest decision was to take neonics,
which is seed treatment elements,
[SPEAKER_03]: push really agriculture in Europe on the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the disease, virus disease,
extremely dangerous on different fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: With Fusarium, very shortly in Germany,
we don't have every year the epidemics,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what we observe every year,
we have contamination this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: From early work of Herman Buistmeyer,
we know this is to QTL and I'm talking now
[SPEAKER_03]: about Fumais 3.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the already DH line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see this elite line from
right side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is already two round of the crossing,
but still is too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not only too long, but it's also
have a lot of other disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the beauty here is Fusarium
resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what I mentioned, if you start
to work with genetic resources,
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially we have in many cases,
many example linkage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because we have now nice tool,
we have a lot of market is not limitation
[SPEAKER_03]: now anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could potentially think about to
increase the recombination.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is give us possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one, my famous example,
I spot resistance on wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, I think you started as your PhD
properly or before PhD, I took 30 years on
plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant breeding to remove negative linkage
on the segment on chromosome 7D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because segment came from agulops
ventricosa and this took extremely long
[SPEAKER_03]: time to remove this segment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened in our case, I already
mentioned here two major QTL.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our idea was 15 years ago,
I tried to put both QTL in very
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible background, opus and moderate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you could see here in both case,
we put in here with both QTL, this both,
[SPEAKER_03]: this one or the other and without QTL.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could reduce the FHB rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was most important for us,
we also could reduce very strongly done
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a nice marker for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could really easily follow in the
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took us at least four years because we
go from Sumayasri through Spring Queen
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat, which is a quicker cycle as winter
wheat, because you don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: internalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have some prototype.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I tell in prototype,
we still not release variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is because we still could not
fully combine the highest yield with
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, it's probably some
biological mechanism behind all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you have been two years ago in
Austria on Weed Genetics Symposium,
[SPEAKER_03]: our last because next we will have
Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may be remember the section of FHB
was six presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now talking about very small
segment from Sumayasri.
[SPEAKER_03]: All six presenters mentioned, my gene is
correct and gene was described before is
[SPEAKER_03]: not wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what is this segment is
potentially some interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe strongly some interaction
behind of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, we don't know mechanism and
we don't know how the relation of
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance with yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in some case, and breeders who is
very experienced, not going for 100% of
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance to one leaf disease,
because they mentioned very simply,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I make the leaf survey empty from one
disease, another will give.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them cost energy for plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back, and this is a really nice
example where we mentioned for German
[SPEAKER_03]: government, if you like to do such
project, the country we will do is Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is show for us is excellent,
how's the international cooperation to be
[SPEAKER_03]: winded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving to hybrid rye, which is my famous
subject I'm really like because I came
[SPEAKER_03]: from country Belorussia and rye bread is
very popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very healthy, I like Germany use,
Poland use, and this is very good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking here, this is pre-basic seeds,
but look on that and to pay your
[SPEAKER_03]: attention, this is not like corn,
because in corn you have two line,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a little bit complex system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And please pay your attention here,
because this is exactly the seeds we are
[SPEAKER_03]: selling for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is important that we have fully
pollen fertility restoration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if not, anyone have idea what will
happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ergot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably most of you are not familiar with
ergot, but in early 60s, pharmacists
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically collected ergot because,
Mark, could you help me with the alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And important here, the pharmacists
collected because it was used in early 60s
[SPEAKER_03]: against abortion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could assume what will be if you
have too much in bread, ergot,
[SPEAKER_03]: and occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was case exactly where I really
like transparency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Grüne Woche in Germany,
and this is biggest exhibition of
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically, I really like both
organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two years ago, the lady, oh,
doesn't matter who, just promote the rye
[SPEAKER_03]: bread and mentioned this is most healthy
bread you have ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question was immediately what
varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: She mentioned me name of whole variety,
and then immediately next question,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is this, muter corn or ergot?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is transparency, doesn't matter
GM or organic, we should have clear
[SPEAKER_03]: description.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be transparent enough to
mention also some organic product could be
[SPEAKER_03]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have too much done in your wheat
organic production, it is not healthy for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should avoid that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a really excellent example
because variation on the resistance is
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have very small variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is good is biological
competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon we have enough healthy pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fungus doesn't have too much chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is competition, this is escape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeders will be mentioned, this is
escape.
[SPEAKER_03]: But breeders, professional breeder,
use escape many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sometimes not care.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one or the other type of.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the position already a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is also beauty because we could
easily, and I really like to show you all
[SPEAKER_03]: style of marker to differentiate between
fertile and sterile because as a case
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder should make next cross and next
year we'll found this is fertile or
[SPEAKER_03]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We save one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this is segment here
located on chromosome four, this piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is a line, our lead,
and this is sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use very efficient back-crossing system
because to select correct plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will be a next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you save one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a summary here, this was hybrid 20
years before and now it's our current
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call this as pollen plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pollen plus is nothing else as use of
genetic resources, molecular breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: and smart breeding, which is my opinion
one of the best example in Europe how we
[SPEAKER_03]: manage that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And came in a little bit to the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already mentioned I started with mapping
of rye genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is Professor Rieke with his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was five, first rye map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is chromosome two, two markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we have published with Andreas
Berner in 2001 with some microsatellite
[SPEAKER_03]: with some traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then reference, you know, we started
this cooperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will show the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was our page of Plant Journal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We improvement this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have golden standard of rye
genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what has happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have 135,000, but we operated with
6,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have any limitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you may ask why we need this old stuff
if you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: As one example, I give you, because I was
also involved with double one is RHG12 in
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not intensive, sensitive,
it's sensitive, not insensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And located along chromosome five,
you know, already location.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now have all markers in four days,
we could came to candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is beautiful, perfect tool we
could apply for that to verify our old
[SPEAKER_03]: story probably, which has helped us now to
landing for specific genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is not job one person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this project we have four
professors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Geiger, who is a pioneer of
hybrid rye program in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are really proud to have a lot of young
people who is with us, who learn about and
[SPEAKER_03]: who could bring this knowledge to the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bali, very shortly, I could not omit to
stay without Bali.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is completely different example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you maybe know Richard Pickering.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was all his life in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he worked on integration of segment
from Hordeum vul Bosum, which is secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: pool of Bali to Hordeum vul Gare,
which is Bali which is growing on the
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am personally should omit,
I make mistake, I mentioned for him,
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard, nobody will use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are very lucky that he did,
because here is integration in one
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome is which is give full dominant
resistance to Bali through virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a really important disease,
because look on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is with resistance, this is without.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have yield at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is transmitted through amphids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because climate change, we have really
big danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically because European Union
stopped application of insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: This I go very quick, because again,
and I'm really proud that you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: put your name here on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is again related to the formula.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember, again, generation interval.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started immediately, you published your
paper, and we started on Bali.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is because we have the age
program, we have already a lot of traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we did, and this is all European
material on six row Bali.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was happy to see this mix of different,
we don't have clustering, because
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders, and I'm talking now,
not about hybrids, I'm talking about self
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinated crops, that's mean breeder
privilege to immediately some variety
[SPEAKER_03]: release to exchange material is very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are afraid a little bit about now
current situation, partly related to
[SPEAKER_03]: Snogoya, but also partly related to Bali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here give us excellent basis to start the
genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did this as wind mold is a basis
for winter mold quality Bali, which has
[SPEAKER_03]: became popular here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did for very, very, very single
trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe this is not a problem to
selection, but is problem for selection
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's related to single.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, make this story short,
going through, it's important which you
[SPEAKER_03]: know that we will not replace the fuel
capacity, but we put the fuel as the best
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also reduce genetic gain per year,
to increase genetic gain per year because
[SPEAKER_03]: we reduce the cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Theoretically, and I already mentioned,
he's dream to have half year selection
[SPEAKER_03]: size.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still far away from, but we have
potential for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did the same for molting Bali
because we decide is okay, yield is
[SPEAKER_03]: important, but important also molting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We publish this in theoretical by genetics
is October 1st, which is in September in
[SPEAKER_03]: Munich.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that not because it's genomic
selection, this is very well correlated
[SPEAKER_03]: with selection, which is again,
very important because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and probably don't know, the assessment of
molting quality is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question always, if you go to
narrow, and if you compare the molting
[SPEAKER_03]: Bali with fitting Bali, you will see like
white and black, very less genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: variation in molting Bali because all
molting Bali breeder going for the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have the quality, but then you
don't have place for increasing of the
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really, this was not possible
for us to do all this advantage without
[SPEAKER_03]: having a physical genetic map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really proud and we have new
round time, don't have time to put new
[SPEAKER_03]: science publication on wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my personal opinion, it's nice to have
chance print as reference genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really proud that we also involved
in 10 plus genome on wheat because I think
[SPEAKER_03]: as happened already in May, we should have
at least few variety and some of them
[SPEAKER_03]: should be elite variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going through, it's also help us a lot the
technology development using tasks in a
[SPEAKER_03]: single application, we use an array,
filling other application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, everything is related to genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened during the last 20 years,
you could look by yourself here,
[SPEAKER_03]: so genetics becomes genomic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The informatics data integration
biometrics challenges are enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Precision phenotyping is limited factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is most important for me
personally, and for us, translation of
[SPEAKER_03]: genomic knowledge in breeder's knowledge
is essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Few words about hybrid wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be aware, what we are looking,
we are looking not mid-parent heterosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will found some publication 25%,
not believe on that because you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: compare conventional heterosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, the difference between your
hybrid and the best elite variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not for much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really proud to be with Peter
Langridge to publish very nice review.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this picture, this is a real
picture, the students are given a present
[SPEAKER_03]: to Cyril Ronald Biffy in John Innocent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Papier-Mache.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I put it specifically as aim for
hybrid wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are still far away from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would don't have probably time to go
more deeply in phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do on different level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do on level of research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do on level of reading on plots,
and we do on level of the field for the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I already mentioned it for you
very partly, data in agriculture to take
[SPEAKER_03]: environment genome and everything to put
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very crucial.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking for the solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some halfway of the solution,
but we're looking for next.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working also in plant physiology
because there's still big disagreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plant physiology published in very
famous journal and mentioned only
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment we could do on control
condition is experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have completely different opinion
between our experiment is field and the
[SPEAKER_03]: question how to combine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking, and you know, stay green is
important for many crops, also for corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking for remobilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very important for me to show you
because public-private partnership is a
[SPEAKER_03]: crucial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in Germany, we have very good
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found very good solution because we
know for scientists is publication.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's must.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you build protected as a company
publication, we have problem to
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation, but also we bring the best
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bring our facility, for example,
genotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very important slide for me
because I mentioned not only turnover in
[SPEAKER_03]: company, not as amount of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, it's very important to keep the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are really proud on plant-produced
academies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a small, but they keep it unique
opportunity for young folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody who have specific passion,
or I will really open to discuss with you
[SPEAKER_03]: and give you some advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have some additional information
here on our portal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also not forget about our teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my professor in genetics,
in plant breeding, in the Academy of
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Academic Hotelova, she is now 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is still active on the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, she is also part of INCIPL
PPO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moshe Feldman, she and this is really,
if you have specific passion, she have
[SPEAKER_03]: answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you maybe know Evgeny Ananyov.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in Pioneer here for a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Professor Geiger, I know a lot about
population genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: My girl was the head of... And I'm really
proud, Mark, to put you up because you
[SPEAKER_03]: also motivate me in some directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finish my presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to give this, you put your little
attention to look through and to look what
[SPEAKER_03]: is a very famous plant breeding in Russia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the basis of GM plus for
Canada, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: He mentioned plant breeding is not only
science, but also is large extent of art
[SPEAKER_03]: of success and not content without
inspiration, creativity, and love of
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my message to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please try to spend your time to think
what's the kind of job you will be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the job you go make you happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not easy, but this is very
important in our life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I'd like to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very thankful for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm open for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Victor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very interesting presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a few minutes for questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I also would say if people have specific
questions after we're finished here,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant breeding 4060 class is meeting
in Jail 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invite anybody that wants to visit
more with Victor to come over here to Jail
[SPEAKER_01]: 4 and join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: KWS went through lysecolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that kind of shut it down or did it
survive just fine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it simple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were operating during
lysecolysis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, did it shut KWS down or how did they
survive?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, it's a very complex question
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk after because I came from a
country which was very heavily affected by
[SPEAKER_03]: lysecolysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have also the possibility in EPK,
which is Omar Dider Institute,
[SPEAKER_03]: to read lyseco paper in original in the
Russian language.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't have too much effect of
KWS by lysecolysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a short answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we came in back with epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, what I could confirm,
not everything what he did and what he
[SPEAKER_03]: write was wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is again message we talk with
young students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we are too conservative in our
decision as scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mention this is only white and black,
but between white and black, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should be ready also for compromise
to think probably in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: No company was not affected by
lysecolysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right now, a lot of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are investing a lot of resources
in achievement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the decisions are regulated in U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: that's precedent or maybe that happening
for gene editing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to know how did, I mean,
maybe in a lot of ways, KWS was lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: because we hadn't made this incredible
financial investment in this technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we say, okay, cool, well, we can just
move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your future advice to
somebody who is looking at implementing
[SPEAKER_02]: this technology with the fear that in say
10 or 20 years, somebody might make the
[SPEAKER_02]: decision that no, actually we're going to
regulate that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because I doesn't like to be because a
lot of things plays a role.
[SPEAKER_03]: Players are all the politicians and many
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a question, answer will be please
invest in the technology, but invest not
[SPEAKER_03]: only in one technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could answer also from side of pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: In pharmacy, if it is from 100 projects,
you have one successful you are
[SPEAKER_03]: successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last point to that, but if you make
decision to invest in hybrid or in genome
[SPEAKER_03]: editing, invest this is on long term
because in two years, you could not turn
[SPEAKER_03]: the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: This should take a hybrid with 10,
15, 20 years probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably we will be not successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am quite skeptic, but this is my
personal opinion because I probably
[SPEAKER_03]: well-informed on direction of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also see the potential because new
advantage on gene editing or the others on
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering solution could be help us with
your hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have time for one last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take KWS to commercialize
their first hybrid drive variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: The story was following the hybrid program
was developed by Professor Geiger and
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Schell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they found the sterility and this is
fully sterility.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem was with the restoration gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And soon they have already a couple of
prototype of hybrid drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give this product to two companies,
KWS and our competitors created specific
[SPEAKER_03]: company for hybrid drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both companies start because healthy
competition is also motor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to register the first variety is 12
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we are much, much quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know in details.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's thank Victor again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
