[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically want to talk a little bit
about some of the work we've been doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's both interesting and offers a
lot of opportunity to move forward on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really started off when Charles
Wasonga, who many of you may know in this
[SPEAKER_00]: department, joined my program in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles is from Western Kenya,
but came here on the Cornell Assistantship
[SPEAKER_00]: for Horticulture in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this assistantship really involved a
lot of the research work actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: done in the home country, in the case of
Charles, in Kenya, or East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Africa is a different place for many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think it more of a kind of a
safari type of land where you may go on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe a lot more rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in actual fact, it's a continent
that's going through changes quickly on
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably changing in many respects as
much as any other part in the world at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back maybe 10, 15 years,
it was very difficult to even communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very difficult to communicate
amongst groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advent of the cell phone has really
taken over and almost bypassed the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of central telephone grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what you're seeing in the last
five years is really pretty astonishing
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of road building that's going
on, particularly driven by the Chinese,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly in more of the interior
areas of the country, like Western Kenya
[SPEAKER_00]: and Western Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started going out there in 2008,
some of the roads in Western Kenya were
[SPEAKER_00]: appalling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could take a couple of hours just
to get maybe 20 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have brand new roads developed by
the Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that in maybe a fraction of
the time, maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot is going on in Africa on a lot of
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot is changing with populations,
where people are living, and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: movements of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the traditional African
diet, it's predominated by corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you see pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's served as a kind of a ground corn
that is called yugali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is typically served with some
type of protein, whether it's Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilapia, which is common around Lake
Victoria, or chicken, goat, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if meat isn't available, then dry
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look beyond the staples of the
carbohydrate and the protein, the next
[SPEAKER_00]: most common side dish that you see from a
vegetable standpoint are leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are not the leafy greens
that we might expect or consume here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves of cow peas are commonly
consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves of sweet potatoes are even
common bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole different range of
leafy greens that are typically served in
[SPEAKER_00]: the African diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The availability of crops is also
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to some marketplaces now,
and you see crops that you would never
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen 10 or 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, green beans or snap beans,
as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in the market, you're even
seeing the availability of broccoli,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's very poor quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amongst the more staples of things
like tomatoes and carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that's really been
driven over the last 10 or 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: largely through the changes in
urbanization, is the appearance of
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supermarkets popping up all over the place
where population centers are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: In areas like Kenya, you're not having a
population increase that's pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, but very noticeable in the
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nairobi, for example, has doubled in the
last 20 years from 1.8 million to about
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.6 million or higher today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along with the supermarkets,
you're starting to see a much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of vegetable crops in particular
that's helping to diversify and advance
[SPEAKER_00]: the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start looking at how some of
these farms are in this area, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically very small, oftentimes less than
an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no mechanization on most of
the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're typically predominated by
crops like corn and dry beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they may have a few plants,
say coffee plants, or some Sukuma wiki
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, or perhaps a couple of bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a farm that we were visiting at
the early part of Charles' project,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were basically going out to speak to
people about some of the crops that were
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, some of the opportunities that
might exist for growers in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually met up with people on a
number of levels, people who were involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with government institutions,
universities, international institutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also outreach and farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we were visiting a farmer
near Massino in Western Kenya with Dalma
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugunga, who's a faculty member at Massino
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had this guy who's involved
with outreach and a couple of growers who,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, are starting to look at snap
beans as an alternative crop for
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get into discussion with a
number of the growers in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the growers in the Massino
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very eager to find new market
opportunities in a way that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify the crops that they have grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to grow a lot of the bagged
staple crops like corn and beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they want to be able to move one step
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want some enterprise opportunities,
some opportunities where they can grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their areas of land, some crops of
higher value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where horticulture and
particular vegetables really start to come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is not the easiest of places to get
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is becoming easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's oftentimes difficulty to get a
vehicle for all of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a vehicle that's not
four-wheel drive, you can run into issues
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, especially when you're in
farming areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Charles actually testing the depth
of the water so we can get this covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went out to Kenya and Tanzania in
2008, and we met a number of groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions, and growers while deciding
how we were going to focus the efforts or
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could actually have some impact
when we're looking at East Africa from a
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of upstate New York,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're visiting the snap bean
production areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are up northwest of Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Charles speaking to a grower,
but we're also traveling with the bean
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder from Kari Thika.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys that are involved with
irrigation and outreach as some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops are being set up in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So snap beans really came to the
forefront, one, because we already work on
[SPEAKER_00]: snap beans here in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other reason is that they're
currently the major horticultural export
[SPEAKER_00]: crop for East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the major single crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the whole floral industry as a
whole, it would be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But snap beans grow very, very well in the
highland areas of East Africa around Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really grown based on an
enterprise basis for feeding into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Western European markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which may seem counterintuitive why are
people growing crops in Africa to export
[SPEAKER_00]: to high end markets in Western Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of benefits that
actually come back from this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that snap beans have to
be of a high enough quality to be aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a lot of these snap beans are
actually produced, only about 30% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are harvested actually make it
to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 70% of them start to make it
into domestic markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you start to see people
consume green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to see them in local markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to see them in supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they actually get adopted as part
of the different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason is an economic
opportunity for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snap beans, because they're harvested as a
fresh market crop, they have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: weight than a dry bean would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a grower is getting 20 Kenya
shillings for a kilogram of dry beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can be getting the same price for a
kilogram of snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be harvesting five times as
many snap beans from the same acreage as
[SPEAKER_00]: dry beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you now give the opportunity for
growers to produce a crop that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, common bean, but give them
access to a fresh market enterprise,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives them a lot of opportunity to
start to earn capital as part of their
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's had a surprising effect in the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I speak to Charles, and we talk
about the snap bean areas in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks about how you drive into
these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you drive into them, you see
noticeable increases in affluence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are actually living in the
areas where they produce snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has become a very important crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even just on a government level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cary Institutes, they are very
keen to try and promote the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: these as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are grown on small farms,
as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small farm northeast of Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also grown at very high altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is that they're very
sensitive to high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the areas around Lake Victoria
are high plains agriculture areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't really think of places like
Uganda and Kenya as being temperate type
[SPEAKER_00]: of climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually look at the altitude
of the regions, Nairobi's at about 1,700
[SPEAKER_00]: meters, Kampala's about 1,800 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these areas that are up north
of Kampala and Nairobi are close to 2,000
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though they're very close to
the equator, the high altitude means that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, in essence, a temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited Nairobi last July, and the high
temperatures in the day were 70 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was about 20 degrees cooler than
here in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually really good climates with
good irrigation for the production of snap
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're at altitudes above about
1,500 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil and the irrigation is also
very high quality in most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: highland areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issues that tend to be encountered
in these new areas that are producing snap
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, the predominant issue is rust,
which is a problem for plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the rust can also get onto the
pods, which is a very important issue for
[SPEAKER_00]: snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important issue for all
horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with marketable yield that
has to have sufficient quality when it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually hits the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem that we see if you go
down to lower altitudes, this is at about
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,100 meters at Homer Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see from Charles's
reaction and the peach juice consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: the increases in temperature that we're
seeing by moving down a few hundred meters
[SPEAKER_00]: in altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issues that you have when you move
down to the Lake Victoria region are ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that the temperatures day and night are
basically too hot for efficient production
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really started to look at these two
traits as the major constraints to green
[SPEAKER_00]: bean production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were setting up this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought in collaborators that I've
worked with in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Portrall, who some of you might have
recognized, he was a graduate student with
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly John here a decade or so ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Talo, Pastor Corrales.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's what you might call the world's
expert on common bean rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent 20 or 30 years at SEAT and he's now
at USDA Beltsville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tim right now is based in USDA in
Puerto Rico and works on heat tolerance in
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and Talo works on the rust
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rust is really a problematic
pathogen wherever common bean is grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical and subtropical environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a major problem right here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sometimes see it at the end of the
season, but it is very severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very limiting, especially from a
quality standpoint for crops like
[SPEAKER_00]: snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have with rust is that we have
many, many different races of it and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what makes it difficult to actually
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of work has been done in dry
bean in the past and some of this has been
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to snap bean from the genetic
resistance standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's approximately 13 genes
associated with rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say approximately because UR1 and UR2
are perhaps lost and then they maybe have
[SPEAKER_00]: a UR13 and UR14 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most interesting of these and it's
very intriguing gene from a resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint is the UR11 and this is a gene
that could have a major impact on common
[SPEAKER_00]: beans worldwide and it is being explored
with multiple programs for its use in
[SPEAKER_00]: rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see with this and that is that
when we have a rust pustule develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a resistant reaction,
it's normally a hypersensitive reaction in
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene-for-gene type of response where you
see this necrotic lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: UR11 is very different in that the
resistance response is more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: field-based resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the spore lands on the leaf,
it forms a very tiny colonization that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really can't see unless you're looking
under a microscope because it's less than
[SPEAKER_00]: half a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows the pathogen to start to
colonize before the resistance comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't have the classic HR
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the evolutionary pressure
from a pest pathogen standpoint and it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually makes the gene very, very
effective against many of the races.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually of the 108 that are stored
at USDA belts the UR11 gene is resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to 107 of the 108 races which is pretty
incredible for a major gene and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is related to the type of resistant
response we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other trait that we're interested
in is heat sensitivity because snap bean
[SPEAKER_00]: production is essentially restricted to
the highland areas because of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity and what happens here is the
difference if we have moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures like in a temperate climate,
we have normal flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start to increase temperatures,
particularly the nighttime temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to influence plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant hormones affect carbon
translocation and this affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive capacity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most predominantly, high temperatures at
night affect the ability for the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: form functional anthers and to be able to
produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have high temperatures,
the pods fail to pollinate themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: so you get a big loss because of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat sensitivity of snap beans is the
reason that these are really restricted to
[SPEAKER_00]: these high altitudes above 1,500 meters
where you have the more temperate type of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked on heat tolerance in beans
for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a graduate student when I first
started here, Katie Martin-Raney who some
[SPEAKER_00]: of you may also know.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did her PhD project on heat tolerance
and we've continued to work with Tim Porch
[SPEAKER_00]: on this as a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we learned a lot during that process
about how we can actually look for heat
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance and how we can actually test for
heat tolerance and we do have good
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in Geneva from a greenhouse
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these tall greenhouses that are
able to maintain temperatures very well
[SPEAKER_00]: and we find by going to a high temperature
regime like 32 degrees day and 27 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: night and then we compare to an optimal
house, we can see the optimal responses of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to heat stress to be able to select
breeding lines that are able to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and produce pods under high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during this process, we developed some
heat tolerance snap bean breeding lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see up here on the top left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two lines from USDA in Beltsville
that were snap beans that had been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed with the UR11 gene that we
wanted to introduce for rust and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all snap beans have the UR4 gene which
complements the UR11 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we initiated some population
development which included selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: heat tolerant plants in a controlled
temperature environment which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse for a couple of generations and
developing inbred lines to the F5
[SPEAKER_00]: generation that we then wanted to test the
presence of the rust genes so we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: select down lines that were first heat
tolerant but also contained or brought in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dominant gene for UR11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the UR11 is an important gene but it's
also one that hasn't been characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: for molecular selection, for example,
and working with rust races is also very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because of the ability to move
them from even a state to state from the
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of the risk of release,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the evaluations for rust
resistance were done by inoculating the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding lines that we developed and this
was done in collaboration with Talo down
[SPEAKER_00]: in USDA Beltsville so you can see here
Charles helping Talo evaluate the
[SPEAKER_00]: responses for introgression of these genes
and we were able to do these by known
[SPEAKER_00]: responses of different rust races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the identification of UR11 can be done
through its susceptibility to race 108 but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's resistant to race 67 and vice versa
the UR4 with its susceptibility to race
[SPEAKER_00]: 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resistance to race 108.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a control line that has
neither the UR4 or the UR11 gene we see
[SPEAKER_00]: rust on both of the leaves as you can see
here and then breeding lines we were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to identify lines so multiple
plants that exhibited the resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: response to both UR4 and UR11 in the lines
that had already been selected for heat
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing the material in the greenhouse
is a convenient way especially if we live
[SPEAKER_00]: in upstate New York but we wanted to
duplicate this and see how they performed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a field situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we've worked with Tim on
the south coast of Puerto Rico where in
[SPEAKER_00]: summer it gets very hot for the entire
season so we have irrigated plots with
[SPEAKER_00]: drip irrigation but we maintain high day
and night temperatures when we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bean growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing these beans in the south coast
of Puerto Rico where they flower in July
[SPEAKER_00]: and August puts a very high level of heat
stress on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to test these lines in
this environment at the same time that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking at the African trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is encouraging about this is if
we look at simple correlations between
[SPEAKER_00]: work done in the greenhouse and work done
in the field which are very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments the two most
important traits for heat tolerance which
[SPEAKER_00]: is the number of seeds that fill per pod
was highly significant and the total seed
[SPEAKER_00]: weight that we get per plant highly
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results that we were seeing in the
field in Puerto Rico correlated in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high way with the traits of interest with
those that we were selecting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse which is very encouraging
because it's a rare example of where
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment stress can actually
be duplicated in the selection of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also then had to try and apply some
of these materials and introduce them
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially into some field testing
environments in East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to do is take a
selection of sites that would go into
[SPEAKER_00]: range in altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could take sites like Kari Katali
which is a government institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is up towards Kampala in Northwest
Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at 1800 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very temperate, very nice
environment for production of snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of place that you would target if
you wanted to produce vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started coming down through altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massino at 1500 and Sabatia down to our
highest heat stress trial which was at
[SPEAKER_00]: Homer Bay which is near Lake Victoria a
little bit less than 1200 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arusha in Northern Tanzania has a fairly
lowish altitude but it also has some
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in dynamics because you have the
topography of the area with the slopes
[SPEAKER_00]: means that you get a bigger drop off in
night temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really reacts like an environmental
altitude that is a little bit higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually is with heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homer Bay though, this is definitely where
you get into a very marginal area from the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that you see for the
production of this type of crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2009 out of the six trials,
we had a 50% success rate in three of
[SPEAKER_00]: these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately this included the high
altitude trial and the low altitude trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other three trials went down for
different reasons, not always ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kibos was attacked by porcupines that
destroyed the entire plot which has
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do with any kind of field
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sabatia was a known site that we planted
at in collaboration with SEAT which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot spot for root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expected this to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just see in what sort of
responses it might have to a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: root rots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the Massino plot go down
with bean flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did have very nice trials with
AVRDC in Arusha with a site that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong connection with CFAD, you're
actually at Homer Bay which is a farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: training center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Kari Katali, a government
institution in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also, as we were doing these trials,
we also wanted to kind of advance some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines that we were developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started to replicate the type of
bean that was being produced in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The types of snap beans we see here are a
very large sieve, meaning the width of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about the size of your finger
perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where those in European markets are very
slender, long, and they're known as French
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are really the preferred type for
Western Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa's an ideal place to grow these
because the high quality that's demanded
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that they're easily damaged
really makes them an ideal candidate for
[SPEAKER_00]: hand harvesting or hand labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of Europe, of course,
is mechanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one thing that Africa has is a lot
of available labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike a machine that'll do a once
over harvest on a field, in Africa with a
[SPEAKER_00]: snap bean field, you'll have people maybe
go through and pick the plants five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: times over the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a course of development to pick the
ideal size of the pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed some parents with the
initial populations that had three for
[SPEAKER_00]: heat tolerance and one for heat
sensitivity, but also ones that were fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the different rust genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to develop populations
cross into three lines that are targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: for Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amy and Theresa are the most commonly
grown varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theresa has the rust gene UR5,
which is quite effective in East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: PV712 is a new pop ringed snap bean that
has the UR11 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also crossed them to a couple
of US cultivars, Masai, which is a small
[SPEAKER_00]: serve for the US market and Bronco,
which is the main fresh market being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a similar approach developing all
20 possible cross combinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting down for sieve size,
heat tolerance, and rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2010, we basically identified
the sites that we thought would work best
[SPEAKER_00]: for us for evaluating these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up going in 2010 with the
three sites in success in 09, Arusha,
[SPEAKER_00]: Homa Bay, and Kitali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our intermediate site, which is
between Homa Bay and Kitalian Altitude at
[SPEAKER_00]: Kerikake Omega, which is another
government institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we had very good results here
in the fact that we had successful trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at all four locations, even though they
had different levels of pressure from
[SPEAKER_00]: rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole process has been quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's enabled us to form a lot of
connections on a lot of levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, international connections,
government connections, pharma training
[SPEAKER_00]: center connections, or even NGO
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really helps us to start looking at
what we can potentially do being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the process of these trials,
Charles was based in Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a lot of the evaluations for,
well, how do these materials develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually perform if we put them out in
these farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some interesting things came
out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat tolerant parent lines that we
evaluated more from a comparable result in
[SPEAKER_00]: owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that when we go from the high
altitude site to the high temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: site, we had very good yield stability in
appearance, which we would expect with
[SPEAKER_00]: heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also had very good rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the rust resistance
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's very minimal drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of the UR11, that's also
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the UR11 gene as these three
lines do, we have very good stability
[SPEAKER_00]: between a non-rust area and a
rust-infected area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that don't have the UR11 gene,
we see about 40% to 50% drop off in yield
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the rust that's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the UR11 can make a huge, huge
difference when it comes to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we look at heat, if we go from the
high altitude to the low altitude site,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have yield stability in these parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the ones that have the rust gene,
like the UR11 or the UR5, they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to lower altitudes,
the heat stress starts to knock the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: performance down 40%, 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really demonstrates what we can do
with some pretty simple work in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled temperature environment to
really make a major difference to crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that are very important for enterprise and
stability for smallholder growers
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a crop that's definitely expanding,
one I visited last year, they're building
[SPEAKER_00]: a new coolant facility outside Kilimanjaro
Airport that is similar to those at
[SPEAKER_00]: Nairobi and Alderet for export of cooled
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the heavily rust-infected area,
these are the responses, the lines that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have on a leaf basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we see rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the type of yields that
we're seeing in some of these breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that we developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that we're promising
having the rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see if you take the yield from
a plant, it's comparable with a sieve
[SPEAKER_00]: type, with the UR11 pop reamed or with
Teresa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually were yielding much
higher than the varieties currently grown
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the comparative rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very encouraging for moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's lines that we actually have
planted out again this year for
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what has really happened during
the process is when we were interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of these sites, we started
taking a wider interest in really what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with vegetables in Africa and
what some of the opportunities might be
[SPEAKER_00]: for farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big one is Sakuma Wiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sakuma Wiki is kind of a Portuguese
truncated brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like a non-heading cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much an ancient crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it may date back to Roman days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that's still grown in
southern Mediterranean areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cabbage that you basically harvest
the plant during the course of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very popular in gardens in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, with a lot of the leafy green
changes that are happening with the foodie
[SPEAKER_00]: market right now, some crops like Sakuma
Wiki in Portuguese truncated are already
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to take off with some of the
vegetable seed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is in the East Africa community
pretty much the most important leafy green
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sakuma Wiki is Swahili.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it translates as to push the weak,
meaning that if people are able to eat the
[SPEAKER_00]: brassica vegetable with their corn and
with the protein, it allows them to have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough food to last the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very, very important plant
from the standpoint of nutrition and
[SPEAKER_00]: diversification of diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really consumed by tens of
millions of people, if not hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: millions, throughout the Lake Victoria and
East Africa region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one vegetable that people
already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of reasons why people choose
to grow this over, say, cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you harvest in it every seven to 10
days during the course of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a crop that's available to you
for the whole season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a crop like cabbage,
you might have to put three or four months
[SPEAKER_00]: investment in to grow in a crop before you
harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be a crop that may get
damaged for any number of reasons that you
[SPEAKER_00]: put all of that investment in without any
type of recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone that's in the East Africa
community is very familiar with Sakuma
[SPEAKER_00]: Wiki and the consumption of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up meeting a lot of people from a
lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this guy's involved in
outreach and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in northern Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also shows where they're trying to
maintain some of these Sakuma Wiki plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop their own sources of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, based on the problems that Sakuma
Wiki has, this is a very dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because contaminated seed is the one thing
that destroys crops in these regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, brassica crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there are efforts for self-seed
production, really, rooting seeds through
[SPEAKER_00]: East African seeds or some of the outlet
are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is if you're a grower in
Africa, it's not like going to a colored
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny's catalog or an internet website to
choose what you want to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of the seeds that
growers in Africa would go to,
[SPEAKER_00]: very predominated by the grains and very
little exposure to any kind of vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: or vegetable seed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you're starting to see
diversification, not just on the stands,
[SPEAKER_00]: but throughout the whole communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabbage is a crop that is expanding
exponentially in some ways in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed sales of it are going through the
roof because of the urbanization that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a storage crop that works very well
with supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are starting to look at cabbage
as an alternate to Sakuma Wiki because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the storability and perishability issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as with Sakuma Wiki, the main problem
that we see is black rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black rot's a bacterial disease,
Xanthomonas campestris.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in through the water and through
the seeds or seed contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: forms these characteristic V-shaped
lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These V-shaped lesions can take over the
plants and destroy your crop in the case
[SPEAKER_00]: of cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in the case of Sakuma Wiki,
they can be damaging 50 to 80 percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have these V-shaped lesions on
the leaves, they're not marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're then fed to livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes, you can lose 80 percent of
your Sakuma Wiki crop because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cabbage, it's even more of a risk
because you risk losing your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cabbage field in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look closely, you can see black
rot starting to appear in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one at about 2000 meters near
Kitali in northwest Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd had success for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a field that is large by
African standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four or five acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this has been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens to a field when you
plant cabbage with black rot on a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get nothing which was devastating for
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a problem like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a lot of years before you think
about planting cabbage or vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the types of crops that are grown are
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issues with sales distribution
channels in Africa are very problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main suppliers in Africa,
a lot going through East African seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's predominated by the South
Africans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it locks out a lot of seed companies
from marketing materials that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: much more appropriate for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to discuss some of these
issues from a diversification standpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we could do with vegetable
brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is meeting in Kisumu a year or so
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Charles is now back in Kenya,
even though he's sort of working as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet potato breeder for SIP across
western Kenya and Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now started up his own company with
Dan Nyambok.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really to try and find
underserved markets for seed in western
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to work with them
through a foundation grant that we got
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Atkinson Center and CFAD to look
at how we could actually get some
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of some of the crops for these
areas and also look into some of the crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that perhaps could be grown that aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Charles and Dan having set up
Advantage Crops Limited, this gives a
[SPEAKER_00]: really important kind of penetration into
a highly underserved market and some very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we started to focus on,
of course, was Sukumawiki because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: such an important crop in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started making backcrosses of
race-nonspecific black rot to this back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an effort that doesn't require a
whole lot of labor, but it does require a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time because brassicas tend to take
about a year to go from seed to seed with
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been working on black rot
resistant in cabbage for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started backcrossing it to
Sukumawiki because it is the same species,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a non-heading type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also started to look to,
well, what types of cabbage are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced in East Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the varieties that are
actually being grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the problem is access to the
correct varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cabbage variety that would have
been grown in New York 30 or 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cabbage varieties here now are hot
water treated for seed, so they have
[SPEAKER_00]: really very little pass over of black rot
from a seed standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do get black rot in the field,
you see how the varieties start to come
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a lot of the newer varieties,
Thunderhead from Reeds, this is a Seminus
[SPEAKER_00]: I Blue Dynasty, but you can see the level
of black rot resistance in an inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: field is significantly lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having access to resistant varieties of
cabbage as those markets start to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: is also very important, not necessarily
from us developing the materials here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually helping them gain access to
those types of cultivars and materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking from a standpoint of
the different types of leafy greens that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started looking, while Charles was here
back in about 2009, at a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a collection trip done in about
2000 right across the southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done with a breeder who's a
collaborator on a federal project with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also somebody who was really familiar
with the areas and anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went around the southeast and they
collected about 100 different land races
[SPEAKER_00]: of collards that really vary depending on
all of the different communities across
[SPEAKER_00]: the southeast, and a lot of them,
of course, African-American communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted these collards and tried to
start to identify some real variation in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf types and the plant morphologies
that were there from these land races that
[SPEAKER_00]: had basically been selected for quality
and edibility over a number of generations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really started to look at not
just the disease standpoint or the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative cultivar standpoint or the
alternative plant type, but we also have
[SPEAKER_00]: to look from a standpoint of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the hard sells is F1 hybrid
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to buy seed that costs
10 times as much as the seed that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: always grown or five times as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could see a hybrid succuma wiki
here compared to a non-hybrid just on a
[SPEAKER_00]: sheer biomass standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes paying some extra money for
the seed can double the yields that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get off a lot of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of areas that need to be
looked at and promoted to try and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: right materials into the hands of a lot of
these growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at USA in Tanzania, which is at an
AFRICEM site, which is a nonprofit venture
[SPEAKER_00]: from East West Seeds and Rick's Barn in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also start looking at crops that
are not Brassica rolleracea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ethiopian mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the biomass of this is
significant, where it's growing almost two
[SPEAKER_00]: meters in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are types of crops where you can
really start to exploit both the yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that there's a lot of openness to
the types of leaves that are consumed
[SPEAKER_00]: within the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last three or so years,
we've been doing trials here in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've been trying to do is
identify a subset that we can introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: and evaluate with some of these partners
and connection sites that we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been looking at some breeding
materials, some varieties, but also a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these accessions that we've identified
from the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these we have in limited seed
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had to develop our own seed to
put forward as part of these studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them develop seeds better than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that we vernalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about four meters tall,
possibly the world's tallest Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a Sukuma wiki that we just
couldn't get to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much we tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we came together last year in
particular to see how we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: to exploit these partnerships and start to
look at some of these alternate types of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as they fit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is up in Kitali with Thomas
Guombo, who's our collaborator at the Kari
[SPEAKER_00]: Kitali site, which is one of the sites
we've been planting at this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've planted at four sites in Kenya and
two sites in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for a lot of
diversification of types, not like you
[SPEAKER_00]: might expect in the US, which would be
more based on color and aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at it more from a
practicality standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the crops that are similar to
what are consumed with Sukuma wiki,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this kind of Portuguese truncata
type where you get the stacked leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would harvest during the course of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also starting to introduce a lot
of stuff that is both commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: available as F1 hybrids and stuff that
we've selected from the color plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were collected from the southeast of the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be kale, which curiously
enough has just exploded in the US market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was speaking to Dutch seed sellers and
they say for 25 years we've had kale seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody wants kale seed, we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overnight kale seed sales doubled and
nobody has any kale seed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came from nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another type of kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just looking at how some of these
different leaf morphologies are really
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted from an aesthetic and cooking
standpoint with the people and communities
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Russian tetraploid kale that has
a little bit more vigor, some color in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: High biomass collard that we've developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some that vary in just the color,
size, the texture of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to try and get feedback from people
about which of these leafy brassicas they
[SPEAKER_00]: would prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a standard collard type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has more of a veiny type of look,
which probably looks a little less edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, some of these ones like
this is a top bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the top selling F1 hybrid
collards throughout the southeast of the
[SPEAKER_00]: US from Bejo seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Giles is super excited about this and
how it may do in the African market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, they have no access to seed
because they have no access to Bejo seed
[SPEAKER_00]: channels through the distributors that
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a new variety bonanza that is
very similar to a Sakuma wiki type that is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible for biomass and also an F1
hybrid that very much fits into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this summer we've been having trials at
these sites where a lot of these materials
[SPEAKER_00]: have been grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've mostly been overseen by Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the Homer Bay site with this
characteristic tump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've included both the cultivars,
the collard selections, and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding lines or preliminary breeding
lines that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is materials we started in 2008
where we've developed the non-heading
[SPEAKER_00]: Sakuma wiki types with black rock
resistance that we're testing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these would be an open for farmer
evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was actually some people
from Cornell associated with the McKnight
[SPEAKER_00]: group that were passing through visiting
for corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even small sites like this have gotten
some attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the personal assistant to the
Ministry of Agriculture in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have some small sites
experimented with some small plots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they very quickly can get exposure as
important as agriculture and food as to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kenyan community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I was unable to go in
September because I had a side impact
[SPEAKER_00]: collision that dislocated my knee cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I had surgery a few days
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will be going back this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing with these materials
is we're replanting them for not just
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer trial sites, but Charles and Dan
are also going to be doing cooking trials
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst a lot of people to see how these
actually taste and how they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: received by the different communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going forward, I think that the
opportunities are really pretty staggering
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's really a grounding of the
only way to go is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that with advantage crops
having been set up, this actually gives a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice kind of entry into the market that's
really heavily protected to many respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was having conversations with a lot
of the people at Bejo a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is set up
Charles and Dan with the product manager
[SPEAKER_00]: for Africa and Middle East so they can act
in some type of reseller or agent capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: for Bejo seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Bejo really have a lot of these
kales and collards and F1 hybrids that
[SPEAKER_00]: really are what the growers need,
not what they have access to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: current climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we go forward, the trend in Africa
certainly is towards urbanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The population is increasing in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 20 years, it's gone up 50%,
60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The population in cities has doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to support
sustainable agriculture on very small
[SPEAKER_00]: farms with corn and beans when you have in
population increases occurring at that
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made a lot of people move to cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small farms are no longer becoming
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunities for vegetables and
horticultural crops from a sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: and enterprise standpoint really are
pretty phenomenal for a lot of these farms
[SPEAKER_00]: because so many of these areas are at
these high altitude sites that have very
[SPEAKER_00]: much of a temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ideal for floral and vegetable
crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, in a lot of this land,
we're just seeing staple crops like corn
[SPEAKER_00]: and beans being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we go forward, we hope to be
involved with that and capitalize on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, has been aided by a
number of supporters, both for Charles'
[SPEAKER_00]: work, which included assistantship
throughout in Africa and AGRA support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more recently, the support that we've
also had in the Brassica work from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atkinson Center Academic Venture Fund and
CFAD with Chris Barrett here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, of course, want to thank my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot more than just this Africa
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of different projects going
on, which is not easy to hold together at
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our summer group.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of us are represented at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out at the back here, which are the people
you might not recognize as part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just really given an overview
of something that is ongoing in many
[SPEAKER_00]: respects because I plan to be out there in
a few weeks to see how some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: materials are coming along and to really
explore where we can go to take the next
[SPEAKER_00]: step with this, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody has any questions,
let's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Griff, I would urge that the establishment
testing and sale of adaptive African
[SPEAKER_01]: collars, whatever you call them,
and it doesn't matter what the origin is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fine black rod is difficult,
but heat treatment can take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as a local industry can get
going, it doesn't have to depend on
[SPEAKER_01]: imports from Bejo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that that would be the
sustainable solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder to what extent you are working in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to produce seed for cabbage
in East Africa because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's a number of things that
really need to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outreach and education to growers is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of resistant varieties or
hybrid varieties is very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also trying to move through
appropriate materials, help to target some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these traits for some of the materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black rod would be important not just for
farms in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the major limiting disease or
brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a strong and bureaucratic link
between a lot of these groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the government in East Africa,
you can see some of the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There tends to be a very strong presence
of the Japanese varieties in brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carter, in particular, was one of the
major distributors in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the stuff that's rooted really
from a lot of South African athletes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they predominate a lot of how the sales
actually work, especially in the hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of the props like
Sukumweki are less baffling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're just running through
institutions like government institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, hot water treatment of seeds
could really change the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that field I showed you was
devastating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was clearly a case of growing cabbage
variety where the seed was highly
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether the varieties are second or
resistant, that's something where even if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was second, it wouldn't be that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we really are out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, Griff, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
