[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know if you have any
difficulty in understanding me because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I have a really strong Brazilian
accent and not to help I went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia, you know, to get a better
English.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I probably should have gone to
New Zealand, you know, to get a better
[SPEAKER_02]: English.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I have this strong
Brazilian Australian accent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first of all, I'd like to thank Dr.
Al-Sofi for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's a great honor to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given this presentation, as Dr. Al-Sofi
told you, I came here in 2015 as a
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting professor with Dr. Chris Watkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually loved Cornell, not just for
the scientific interactions that I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also it was summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was just wondering,
how is this campus during the winter?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I am nine years later here at the
campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Dr. Al-Sofi also mentioned,
I was a professor in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never, ever worked with potatoes
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a post-harvest physiology work with
mangoes, bananas, pineapples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the University of Idaho was
crazy enough to hire me for this position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the type of my presentation is
pretty much what I'm experiencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I still understanding potato
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bring it back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, today I will give you the glimpse of
understanding potato post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's start with a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, why potatoes are so special?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, because they are yummy
and versatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, many people like potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, the Potatoes USA said that
for the last two years, the Americans
[SPEAKER_02]: rated potato at the most preferred
vegetables that they can have as a food
[SPEAKER_02]: choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one is broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's a really easy race.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you compete with broccoli,
I think everything is going to be good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, potato is now the leading,
the most preferred food in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potatoes are so really nutritious.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about potato, people just
think about a carbohydrate as a source of
[SPEAKER_02]: energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But potatoes also is really a good source
of protein and as a good source of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to the gym, people eat a lot
of bananas because bananas is rich in
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But potatoes are some of the varieties of
richer in potassium than bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same is vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of vitamin C in potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there's a fight between the
industry and the health people in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: putting potato or not as a vegetable or as
a healthy food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the achievements of the Idaho
Potato Commission was to be able to put
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes as a good food for the diabetic
society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have this label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so potatoes are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just yummy, but a good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes are so economically important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So China is the largest producer of
potatoes in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But China produces a lot because they have
to feed 1.5 billion people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And India is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the US is the fifth largest producer of
potatoes in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Idaho is the leading state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Idaho produces 35% of potatoes in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a Washington state with 27%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Wisconsin and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tri-state, so Idaho, Washington,
and Oregon, produces 67% of the potatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we produced in the tri-state area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how about New York?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The upstate New York produced roughly
200,000 tons of potatoes in 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an industry offering approximately
$50 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an important industry for the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays a vital role for the potato
industry in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just releasing new varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just visited the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I told it to Dr. Wang.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was marvelous to see all the research
that's been carried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Wei is also doing a research with
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know him by name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I met him in some of PAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good in faces, but I'm pretty
bad in names.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, although potatoes are really
important, not just nutritionally
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, but economically speaking,
take a look at the losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a FAO report that say that in the
world, we're still losing 45% of all roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and tubers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take into consideration just North
American and Oceania, like Australia and
[SPEAKER_02]: New Zealand, it represents one billion
bags of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good for us as a potato process,
we still have a lot of room to improve and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The losses are mostly due to disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a picture of my colleague,
Dr. Nora Olson.
[SPEAKER_02]: She works a lot with pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work with pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that would be another seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to talk about the pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pathological problems of potatoes in
storage is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk more the physiological
aspects of potatoes in storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a quick overview about potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to move to a
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Brazil, when I taught all these
different crops like bananas, mangoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always start for the origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to understand from where
that crop came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can understand all the
horticulture practices that you can apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot grow mangoes in tropicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow potatoes and apples in Brazil in
the high altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is really difficult because this
is not the climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use a lot of chemicals,
et cetera, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bananas are apples are from tropical,
from temperate zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potatoes are also from the temperate
zones from the Andes in the South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they develop in the high altitudes for
the temperate zones in South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different varieties,
types, colors, shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a huge diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Spanish, they took just a small
portion of this variety of diversity and
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced in Europe and from Europe to
the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the UK to the United States and
other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most important thing of
understanding the origin is to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: the climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see well this
graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a climatological information from
Cusco in Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the mountains here in
the X.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the precipitation is the black line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the temperatures, the highest
temperatures, the orange bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lowest temperatures, the gray
bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to take into consideration
that the seasons in the South Hemisphere
[SPEAKER_02]: is the opposite from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now it's winter here and it's
carnival in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's summer and carnival.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, my brother is sending me
pictures of he is now dancing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: carnival.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves carnival.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so we have spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the crop starts to develop,
why it starts to develop in the spring?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we plant potatoes also in the
West, because we have an increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: precipitation and the minimum temperature
starts to raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potatoes are able to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crop will grow, develop the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the start of the reduction in
precipitation and also the reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: the daylamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the turbidization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant will senesce during the
autumn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less water, the temperatures will go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant will senesce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, in the winter,
the tubers will be in the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cannot grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's cold and there is no water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly where we harvest potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So potatoes, you have to think that we are
just animals that eat fruit and vegetables
[SPEAKER_02]: to disperse the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes were not meant to be eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes were meant to reproduce the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to say a classical chart
about development and the horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was published by Watara and
co-authors in 1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a classical information.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the tubers and roots,
you can see that they have to be harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: at the physiological maturity stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many crops, for example, if you go to
Browseus Browse, you're going to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: them at the maturity stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are all immature in the growth stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.
[SPEAKER_02]: But potatoes not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are physiological mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how the potatoes develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plant the seed potatoes and we meet the
stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stem will grow, forming the canopy of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some stems will develop in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stolons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these stolons, they will accumulate a
lot of starch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forming the tubers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, potatoes, when we eat
potatoes, we are eating a stem or a branch
[SPEAKER_02]: of a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That accumulates the starch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a branch of a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epical bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the leaves and scars with the
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have many eyes with the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the lenticelles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have multiple lenticelles in the
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference is that branch
developed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's a picture just to show all
the parts of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the very same parts of a
branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you that potatoes will develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it starts to reach the open,
the plants will senesce and the tubers
[SPEAKER_02]: will be red to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's easy to determine the
maturity of potatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard because you can't see.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see an apple turning from green
to red, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A mango from green to yellow is pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at that and say, okay,
it's turning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can harvest that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about potatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some varieties that they keep,
they are really vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have really green canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people are developing drones and
try to have satellite images and imagery
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to get maturity determination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really complicated because it depends
on not just variety, but you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen with the canopy?
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be green.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tubers are already immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of maturity indexes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are related to the quality
for the industry, especially specific
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity that's related to the content of
dry matter in the tuber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The desirable tuber size.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if you are growing specialty
potatoes, you as a grower, you want a
[SPEAKER_02]: small tuber.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a big tuber for specialty
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, for the industry,
you have potatoes this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an yield is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an essence of the canopy in
some varieties and in some conditions and
[SPEAKER_02]: the thickening of the skin that is called
skin scent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to illustrate how that develops in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the days after planting,
specific gravity and reducing sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a look at how the gravity
increases over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you reach the desired number,
that's 1.08, you can get the one
[SPEAKER_02]: indication of the maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same with sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry doesn't like potatoes with a
high content of sugars because when we put
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fryer, we have a Maillard reaction,
we'll turn dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these numbers together,
we can establish the physiological
[SPEAKER_02]: maturity as expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have differences in varieties,
the differences in the maximum yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: the maximum specific gravity, the minimum
surplus or the minimum sugar content.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get all these numbers and you add
and divide it by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the physiological maturity,
this magical number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, this is the best example
of the best indicator of a maturity,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the accumulation of the green days
above four Celsius or 39 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the accumulation that during the
season, that's the better predictor of a
[SPEAKER_02]: physiological maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why physiological maturity is
important?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as any other crop, potatoes are
really susceptible to the varieties or the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in the environment and
temperature, especially temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in higher temperatures, the tuber will
be physiologically mature or older.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one student in Brazil and she's
doing her PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of her experiments, she went to
the grower four hours away.
[SPEAKER_02]: She spent the whole day harvesting and
digging, getting potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When she arrived at the lab, the tubers
were already sprouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in Brazil, we don't have cold
weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when potatoes are exposed to higher
temperatures during the growth period,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna get older.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is that important?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because older potatoes or physiologically
older potatoes do have shortened shelf
[SPEAKER_02]: lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love this trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a study published by Zomit and
co-authors in 2014, just to illustrate how
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature can influence the physiology
of the tuber in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the author put a lot of a resistant in
the hill to increase the temperature at
[SPEAKER_02]: different periods of the tuber
development, especially after during
[SPEAKER_02]: bulking, bulking or at the end of tuber
bulking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And increase the temperatures over here to
29C in relation to the environment that
[SPEAKER_02]: was 16 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: 29C at maturation for ranger russet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the sprout compared to the
ambient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to illustrate that what my students
faced in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have higher temperature in the
bulk, that's what you're gonna have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Older potatoes and short shelf life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another indicator, that's the skin set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So skin set is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it usually develops well after three
weeks of vine kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the growers, they have the crop and
then they spray the crop with a herbicide
[SPEAKER_02]: or other product to kill the vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vine kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after three weeks, they can harvest,
the peel will be well developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how about in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks in Canada is too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, they don't have the luxury of
waiting three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they harvest potatoes,
that's a green potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have the vine green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the season is too short.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cannot wait three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks they will be frozen in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a big problem, especially
because immature tubes of poor skin set
[SPEAKER_02]: will lead to more disease, more
dehydration and more defects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this part, I covered the physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm gonna go to the funny part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a harvest and putting the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So harvest potatoes are not easy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My students, she needs to dug all the
potatoes for her trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there always is a balance,
I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this balance of maturity that we need
to go adequate gravity, a low respiration
[SPEAKER_02]: rate, when they are mature, adequate skin
set, low weight loss and the opposite when
[SPEAKER_02]: they are immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how to harvest potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to cover every single one,
but just to show you that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple steps that can lead to mechanical
injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because potatoes in many parts of the
world, the commercial production are
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested using mechanical harvesters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to illustrate that, I brought this
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it works.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a big farm in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a water farm from Japanese
descendants family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the size of the farms in
Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a digger or more than eight rows
taking potatoes out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at these and the possibilities
of mechanical injuries in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the sound, but you know,
I could not take this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the harvester that collects
the tubers from the ground, put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pivots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, take a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have to go all around and fall into the
truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this truck will take the potatoes
to the cellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just call it cellar because in the past
we used to store potatoes actually in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cellar of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the size of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the potato load in the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cover the potatoes with a sheet that's
really good to avoid the heat load from
[SPEAKER_02]: the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes to the pylon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some people here sawing the
potatoes and also taking the dust out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go to the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to show the many steps that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can fill one of these big cellars
in one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the amount of potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the ventilation system here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how they can manage all the
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: The logistic is involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's not surprised that we have a
lot of mechanical damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So NOES and co-opers published that the
70% happens during the harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14% at the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pylon 14%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, very low, 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all this mechanical damage will result
in death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really poor quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the poor quality is not just related
to the bruising itself, but also the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all openings that can lead to more
weight loss and the entry of a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a shadow bruise and mechanical
damage like an internal black spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this blackening is due to an
enzyme called polyphenol oxidase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have, when you have a scratch,
it doesn't turn black.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing the same job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxidizing the monophenols in diphenols,
but they still colorize.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the diphenols in autoquinones that are
a little bit yellowish color, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: really reactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why they are reactive compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the plant produces that to protect
the plant against the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this compound will react with the amino
acids and proteins from the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that case, we react with the amino
acids and protein leading to dark polymers
[SPEAKER_02]: that the industry doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the industry doesn't like to the point
to develop a silenced PPO potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a potato that was released by
Simplot, one of the largest companies in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a look at the difference between
one potato with PPO5 and without PPO5,
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is no brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also developed that the silenced
Asparagine A1 gene, there is no acrylamide
[SPEAKER_02]: A synthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that I don't like in that
is as a post-harvest physiologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: we never can forget all the via process
that the potato passed from the field to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The multiple steps of mechanics
[SPEAKER_02]: can also affect all the quality aspects of
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we do start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are multiple steps in the
storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go over all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump into directly to the
curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I showed you one picture of the
potato with a lot of skinning problem
[SPEAKER_02]: that's due to abrasion when they are
moving from the ground to the cellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this curing is really important,
especially to produce a new layer of a
[SPEAKER_02]: periderm and protect the potatoes from
disease and desiccation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to follow all these
recommendations from a note from
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing is not exclusive for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So onions and garlic, we have the curing
process in the post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to dry out this problem and
develop a new skin to protect against
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is wound healing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the sound peel of potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the suberized layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the subepidermal cells and
cortical cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's damaged, potatoes do have a
really nice capacity of producing a new
[SPEAKER_02]: layer of cells due to the position of
submarine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut potatoes and let them in your
table, in four days you'll have a new skin
[SPEAKER_02]: on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many other crops do have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet potatoes, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a three-step process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have initial one that takes place in
zero to 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the subarization that takes a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the wound periderm formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the initial response,
it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the damaged cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the damaged cells will produce what we
call damage-associated molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially a oxygen reactive species and
the release of calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reactive oxygen species and calcium
will be responsible for sealing off the
[SPEAKER_02]: plasma desmaras, not leaving the pathogens
to getting the adjacent cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So protecting that sound cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the calcium will move through the
other cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And initiating the cascade of
phosphorylation that will lead to the
[SPEAKER_02]: transcription of defensive genes to
protect the sound cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really important is to understand
the role of the reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the noxious oxidase,
this NADPH oxidase, that has a peak in 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this enzyme does, this enzyme
produces superoxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Superoxide will have a superoxide
dismutase that will convert this
[SPEAKER_02]: superoxide into hydrogen peroxidase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hydrogen peroxidase is a substrate of
peroxidase that will oxidize the phenolic
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds into a submarine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that complicated, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And leading to the suberization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suberization is a process of forming
that new layer of submarine in the damaged
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the time, you can see
that it's extremely dependent on
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the role of Tommy Pohl's harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you cool potatoes really
quickly, they're going to affect the wound
[SPEAKER_02]: healing, and it's going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to keep potatoes a little bit
warm for this process to take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another enzyme that's really important
in that part is the phenylalanine
[SPEAKER_02]: ammoniolase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or as in the United States, phenylalanine
ammoniolase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Liase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this enzyme is responsible for
converting the amino acid, phenylalanine,
[SPEAKER_02]: into transceinamic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the accumulation of a
transceinamic acid with an oxidase
[SPEAKER_02]: activity producing superoxide,
hydrogen peroxide, and the wall-associated
[SPEAKER_02]: peroxidase forming the submarine that will
lead to the accumulation of submarine in
[SPEAKER_02]: the new pair there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally is the differentiation of the
new cells that also is dependent on
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always a trade-off between the
temperature and the physiological process
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the highest the temperature,
the faster is going to be the curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at higher temperature, what you're
going to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: A higher probability of disease
development and weight loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we cool that down, we're going to slow
the curing process, control the decay
[SPEAKER_02]: development, and reduce the weight loss,
but with a cost in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to show how the new wound pair then
will form using a different decay dye,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see that a microscope did.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's go to cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Pacific Northwest, we use
evaporative cooling in the majority of the
[SPEAKER_02]: storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few potato storage do have a
mechanical refrigeration system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some do have, especially when they harvest
potatoes in August, they're still really
[SPEAKER_02]: warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a huge heat load.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine one of those storage full of
potatoes at 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge heat load inside that
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the evaporative cooling doesn't have
the capacity of removing all that heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have a supplementary mechanical
unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can actually lease a mechanical
refrigeration system and put in your
[SPEAKER_02]: system to try to cool potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the most important part of the
evaporative cooling is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes always must be stored at 97%
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're going to lose a lot of
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And weight is money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes are 80% water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you lose water, you lose money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ventilation is the way that is used in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk a lot about ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, ventilation is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ventilation, in my perspective,
is just a way to cool down the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot use hydro cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could use hydro cooling, I would talk
about the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about water, I'm talking
about air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air movement is ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two main systems, we have the
pipes that are put in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have also the concrete with
perforations that go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have these structures here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the flannel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The air is blown from my side to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get in these holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they live from here, to the top of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is we have 18 feet of
potatoes for this air to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the capacity of the evaporative cooling
is huge to be able to have enough air to
[SPEAKER_02]: move through this crop and remove the
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever the curing period is over,
we need to cool that crop really quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: to the holding temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's usually done by reducing the
temperature 0.25, 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_02]: per week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you imagine that we're going to move
from 50 to 55 to 42, it takes almost one
[SPEAKER_02]: month to reach that temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long period.
[SPEAKER_02]: That potatoes will be exposed to higher
temperature and the possibility of losing
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the ventilation takes place here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you have a higher ventilation
rate, we can cool that crop really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most important part, again,
is to keep that high moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: high relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because take a look at the, it's not the
speeds of the air that will lead to the
[SPEAKER_02]: weight loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the relative humidity in
that air that will drive the weight loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at 99%, take a look, potatoes actually
get weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 97, that's the recommended,
you're not going to lose weight,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though we have a huge airflow here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 90, take a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the relative humidity that
drives the weight loss and not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: ventilation itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's go to holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding is the temperature that we keep
potatoes for 8 to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potatoes are not different from the
other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the higher the temperature,
the shorter is going to be the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can say, the lower the temperature,
the longer is going to be the shelf life
[SPEAKER_02]: of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's an exponential relationship,
as many other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But potatoes always have, it's a
complicated problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a problem that's called
sweetening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's called sweetening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who likes barbecue?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Brazil, I love barbecue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do, I get my, my cooler,
I put there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ice, water, and salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I put the salt?
[SPEAKER_02]: To reduce the freezing point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be below zero and it
keeps my beer cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potatoes do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put the cell in the lower
temperature, as an adaptation,
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes will hydrolyze the starch
[SPEAKER_02]: producing glucose and fructose,
increasing the osmolarity of the cell,
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting the cell from freezing or
cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the first, one of the
first slides that showed your origin?
[SPEAKER_02]: The tube was on the ground, in the ground
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an adaptation to survive the
winter, to be able to germinate during the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty bad for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this reducing sugars, when we fry
potatoes again, when they, at the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, have Maillard reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reducing sugars, we react with
amino acids, producing melanoid genes that
[SPEAKER_02]: are dark pigments, and also can produce a
prolamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, the temperatures for the
holding period varies according to the end
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, for table potato or fresh
potatoes that we eat, we buy in the
[SPEAKER_02]: supermarket to make a smashed potato that
I'm going to cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put potatoes at below 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, some growers put at 39,
40 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for frying, we should keep these
potatoes at higher temperature because we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to avoid that cooling, the cooling
sweetmore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for chips, it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on the end use, you have
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because consumers don't like dark French
fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can eat dark French fries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But McDonald's, for example, wants just
USDA's number zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really pale potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whiter, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to simplify here, some trials at the
University of Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tina Brandt, she now, she works for
Sceneplot, but she did this aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: She worked for the University of Idaho for
many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have here two different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Russet Burbank, that is standard for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Clearwater Russet now is also approved
by McDonald's just to show how they react
[SPEAKER_02]: during the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used mostly three temperatures,
42, 45, 48.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take a look, that's the limit of
sugars, 0.1% glucose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at Burbank at 42 during the
holding period.
[SPEAKER_02]: All above the threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just at 48, it was pretty much at the
limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But take a look at Clearwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the industry is moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're called cold resistant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't have this increase in sugars
during the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of reflectance, that's the
color of the fry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have used the USDA chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's consider USDA zeros, one,
two, three, and four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the Clearwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the chips, all the fries were above
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take a look at the Russet
Burbank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's to show that the quality can
change according to the varieties and also
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature that we use to store
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really good when you have like
in a breeding program and post-harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: program, they're working together because
that's a, we need to determine the end use
[SPEAKER_02]: of that variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be really good in terms of yield,
but you know, cannot store well at 42.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be stored at 48 to keep the sugars
below the threshold and the color as a
[SPEAKER_02]: good color.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some remedies, but they're not
100% efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is reconditioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is reconditioning?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to take potatoes from that cold
environment and increase the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have a potato stored at four Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 39 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then transfer to 16 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look that this one Jamstar Russet
is cold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zeroes, zeroes is a really good variety to
store at low temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the Fenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was USDA number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it increased the
temperature, it went down to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I like to explain why.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is behind this?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The respiration wasn't here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we put that 16, take a look what
happened with the respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respiration is a process that consumes
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by consuming sugars, you can improve
the quality, but not a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best way to do with this is to get
cold resistant varieties.
Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also have biotech knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I showed at PPO, the industry also is
moving to have a RNA interface,
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes, especially blocking the action
of invertase.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, we don't have this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because with the invertase,
the sucrose cannot be converted into
[SPEAKER_02]: glucose and fructose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't have a reducing sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the industry is doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was talking with a Dr. Al-Shafi maybe
20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have any problem in
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all these transformations,
they're gonna solve all the problems that
[SPEAKER_02]: we face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the other problems that we face
is sprouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I showed you, you have the dormant
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dormant period now is related to
the dormancy that the potatoes present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dormancy is related to the
accumulation of a hormone such as abscisic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid that prevent the growth of the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever the abscisic acid is metabolized,
it's oxidized, then you have many other
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolic a process we can have the
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just show that the adaptation for
that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really dependent on variety and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at the standard Russell
Burbank at 42 as a period of a dormant
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit of how many minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: 175 days at 48, 130.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we store potatoes at 240 to almost
a year?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to apply chemicals to control
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot apply in pre-harvest as malate
hydrazine or in the post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, we use a lot of
chloropropane that is not allowed in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use a lot of ethylene there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but no, chloropropane is really
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at these.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same varieties 45, 48 with CIPC,
without CIPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look how effective is this product.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now again, biotechnology taking place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So controlling, they start to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have sucrose and then you have
potatoes without a sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same as apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have just one season in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Brazil, we have a luxury to have three
seasons of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the United States, just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to put these potatoes in the
storage and supply all the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an easy task to take potatoes out
of the storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to avoid new brews that the
industry called, have the old brews from
[SPEAKER_02]: the harvest period and have the new brews
that's formed in this step of the
[SPEAKER_02]: post-harvest management, especially if
potatoes are really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they are really cold, if they heat
something, they will shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have to increase the temperature a little
bit to be able to take potatoes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the main problems that causes a
lot of rejections is the flattening of
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes, especially if they, when they
take these potatoes out of the storage,
[SPEAKER_02]: in four to five days we have this internal
browning that the industry called a
[SPEAKER_02]: turning black.
[SPEAKER_02]: For fresh market, that's what we are
seeing in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of robotization and artificial
intelligence used.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this company, the same company,
Wada, they have seven robots, just three
[SPEAKER_02]: people working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it reminds me that the book of Yuval
Harari, almost sapiens and talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial intelligence, substituting us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take home message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you had to understand a little bit
about potato post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have all these things taking place
when we put potatoes in storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to thank my team,
University of Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my significant Samuel Peitosh,
my two students from PhD from Brazil,
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanessa, Pedroza and Mike Isidoro at the
University of Idaho and the Potato
[SPEAKER_02]: Consortium at USDA for funding my
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to do my advertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hiring people, especially masters and
PhD students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And saying that, I open up for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, if a browning has
some safety problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like coffee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like chocolate?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these products, they are dark
because of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us to have it like a dark
chocolate, they have the cocoa and nuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kernel, and we put them to ferment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, we roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That roasting process is exactly the PPO,
all this conversion of a compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tea, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many products that we eat, the browning
actually is really good for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part, so doesn't that have any
safety concern?
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that's a nutritional
concern, because when PPO reacts with
[SPEAKER_02]: amino acids, reduces the availability of
proteins and amino acids for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not in the point that we will
reduce the protein content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
