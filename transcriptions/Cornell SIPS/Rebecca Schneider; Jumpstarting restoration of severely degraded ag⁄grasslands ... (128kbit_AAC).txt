[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real honor to be here and a
pleasure, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like coming to the heart
of what this whole program is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a high-growing ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in wetlands for almost all my
life until about seven years ago I was put
[SPEAKER_00]: in what was a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, oh, this is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so learning a lot about agriculture
and watering and agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought today, you know,
I think I'm going to give an overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is that it will stimulate
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe different pieces will appeal to
different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have lots still to do, lots of
things we're trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know something about it,
hear me say something that doesn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, or you know something different,
we're trying to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to email me or call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to you about that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're hearing today is kind of an
overview of the whole program,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank, there's a lot of people
in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most important one is this
woman, Director Li Jian.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's actually the head of the Ningxia
Forestry Institute, the director of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory of Seedling Biogineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's so influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the one they asked the governor of
Ningxia province, which is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent of a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to restore this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put her in Congress for China.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's that influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been a big motivating force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Shengxiao Li at Southwest University
in Chongqing is actually responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration of the Three Gorges Reservoir,
the entire riparian area around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was here as a Humphreys fellow back in
like 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who brought Cornell over and
said that these people can help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Moriello is over in our department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention some of the work he does,
but he's been my partner in almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: this going back and forth to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold's been influential from the
beginning in guiding us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, a lot of you see your
names up there, who come to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've given us advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you were really good about being
collaborators on proposals and supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people who have helped
in different ways, and it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we'll keep building this
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is give you a part
about what's the framework for what this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole project is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what we've come to understand
the system about agriculture in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feedback welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with that context, we'll talk
about what we've been doing in Ningxia,
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started moving into the Great Plains of
the United States in Manda North,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dakota, and then we have some new
directions we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, there's a lot of pieces to
this, and hopefully, I'll keep you with me
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big issue is this one of how to feed
the population of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we have 9 billion people by the
year 2050, and we have to close a nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% gap between how much we currently
produce and how much we're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do water, so I'm always focused on the
water part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is, all the water we
consume around the world, 70% of it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to use for irrigation to grow food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really to me an issue of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, about 2,800 cubic kilometers of
water consumed each year just for
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a quarter of our crop lands are
irrigated, and that delivers one third of
[SPEAKER_00]: our agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one solution to the food problem is ag
intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will increase our yields through more
irrigation and more fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality, I do water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is arguably the most scarce limiting
resource on the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not energy, and I'll argue that a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all different kinds of analyses
of how many people are subject to water
[SPEAKER_00]: scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always done on an annual basis,
and the approximate number was about 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the world's population deals with
some level of water scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2016, the study came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, if you just look on a
monthly basis, 4 billion people have water
[SPEAKER_00]: scarcity, and they don't have enough water
any given month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really almost half the world's
population deals with water scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up here, when we throw away fresh
water, it rains so much, we get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, wow, we don't really
pay attention to how important this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this has been exacerbated by climate
change, because it's changing where and
[SPEAKER_00]: how often and how much rainfall we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just one of the model
predictions for changes in precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see as it gets browner,
that means you have fewer and fewer inches
[SPEAKER_00]: of rain per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we saw, like the big
drought in California, and in large parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world, less water to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that issue of let's increase
irrigation, to me, it's like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not a good solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need water for people to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need water for all the other uses that
we have for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second big factor is soil degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is now getting into
your realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm pleased to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that land degradation, this was an
estimate in 2017, land degradation is
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated to affect about one quarter of
all the global land area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different maps showing high
severity, very high severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So large portions of the land are really
degraded, which affects their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have unhealthy soil,
then you actually need more water to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the same amount of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a photo just showing what we
saw in Ningxia, China, where every single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you see if you see something
growing, it's got a drip irrigation feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either coming from groundwater,
which is very scarce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't monitor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's coming from the Yellow River,
which also runs dry in location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, I mean, everything has to be
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the agriculture to grow the
food occupies basically 40% of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: land service of the earth, either as crop
land or as pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that whole issue of,
well, if we quit eating meat, we can shift
[SPEAKER_00]: this over to growing crops, and it's much
more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the solutions when you
look at all what are the solutions to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with needing to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's this cool fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the epiphany for me as I was
learning about this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out in a 2013 report by the United
Nations Environmental Program addressing
[SPEAKER_00]: these issues of how do we grow enough
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is look at all the land
surface of the earth and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, OK, 5,000 million hectares are
deserts, glaciers, others.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,900 are forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where we have permanent pastures and
arable land, all of that was grassland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we put all of our agriculture,
and almost 95% of it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start to say, well,
grasslands, huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of, like, a lot's been done
on grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, they basically kind of
generally came to three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Savannas, prairies, or steppes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Great Plains of the United States
that we tend to call prairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, now in some places they're
calling it a steppe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, well, if it's a third of the land
surface of the earth, you'd think there'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit more diversity to it than
just three types of grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, NatureServe, TNC,
are definitely starting to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of different kinds
of grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting to understand them
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key point is that grasslands,
where we put all our agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: developed in areas that are semi-arid or
arid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 500 millimeters of rainfall a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're naturally evolved to deal with
semi-arid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Whitaker put out, a long time ago,
the biomes of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, in this moderate
temperature range, but low precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: for grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were incredibly productive
historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you had these incredible all
these different bison, anubis,
[SPEAKER_00]: bovids, all these different migrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below ground, you had all this
productivity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the millions of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below ground, there's tons of
different species of rodents and prairie
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were birds and insects that
lived off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's this incredibly productive,
different levels of the food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living in a system that was very arid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet now, this is where we put our
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having trouble growing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, what have we done to that
system that's made it now not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: support what it used to support?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be showing you what we're
doing in temperate grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons is, I don't know
what's going on with tropical grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to be talking about
mullisaw organic soils that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Africa, they have some of the
highest species diversity of mammals,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly bovids, which are horn
animals that have hollow horns that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible species diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant that those grasslands were
stable, long-term environments in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for that kind of speciation to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the mechanisms are that
maintain those systems in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about the
temperate ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, here's all this productivity
in semi-arid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One factor in the temperate systems were
these mullisaw soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you guys, which were deep organic
soils that formed because the grasses was
[SPEAKER_00]: decaying roots decaying leaves that would
build up in the soil and have this organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that was basically like a cellulose
sponge is the way I like to think of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I explain to people that you use by
your sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absorbs and holds water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of the United States,
the green here are the mullisaw soils up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch down in South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large parts of Asia had these soils that
were a factor in a semi-arid climate that
[SPEAKER_00]: when it rained, it could hold that
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at, this is the most well
documented case that we can find,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the Great Plains of the United
States, where mullisaws being 60 to 75 or
[SPEAKER_00]: more percent of the soil is a mullisaw
soil throughout the central, the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, which is right where our tall
grass, mixed grass, short grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: prairies, mainly those there, occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were our mullisaw soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then John Deere, 1837.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, you guys know all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I live up in Truman's Burrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's farm fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's green tractors everywhere I look
to see John Deere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, hey, there's this guy out
there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he invented the stainless steel plow
that was the first thing that could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually break through the grassland sods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10,000 of these were sold by 1855.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what allowed agriculture to
develop in our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1855, we began to break apart the
grasslands, the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began to erode away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in other places, it was livestock
overgrazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what I can tell,
the surface mullisaw soil began to
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dustfall in the Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually Black Sunday,
because that was the black organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these very iconic
photographs showing loss of the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: organic layer, 16 million acres destroyed
in Texas by erosion, terrorist to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was beginning, from what I can
tell, the NRCS and their whole health
[SPEAKER_00]: program, soil health program in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we think about, well, what was the
original soil like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NRCS I can get access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They began monitoring erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these different maps from
1982 at every two to four year intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is 1982, 1987, 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the rates of erosion per region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you add them all up, it was about
180 tons per acre of erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harold gave me this great photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can find other photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, yeah, but that was
already in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Sunday was like 1933.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plows were in 1855.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's almost 100 more years
of erosion that wasn't documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the soil look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these soils that were so
productive that could support so much
[SPEAKER_00]: life, what did they look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that is well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture has been going on,
apparently, for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Greece, and this is
actually where I was reading this book in
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece right before we went to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, Crete used to be
covered in shade trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a barren soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only vegetation left was called a
phrygania, a soil incapable of holding
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only plants left were aromatic drought
pollen shrubs that goats wouldn't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the trees have been, and then you
can read about it, taken away either to
[SPEAKER_00]: build ships, where around most of the
world, they're taken away as fuel for
[SPEAKER_00]: heating or for cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever leave wood behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gradually, what it looks like is a
barren landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in 425.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, in the Pompas of Argentina,
a lot of native grasslands are still
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversion is happening again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's beef cattle ranching,
and erosion problems are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like in less than 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this timeline of the
further you go back, it looks more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more thinner and eroded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you end up with these maps of
global soil degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ratan Lao out in Ohio has been doing
estimates since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, guys, we have depleted global soil
organic carbon stocks by as much as 66
[SPEAKER_00]: picograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know if that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 72 billion US tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A phenomenal amount of our organic matter,
we have eroded away.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the background that,
as I understand it, that this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion loss has been going on on what was
one third of the land surface of the Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was converted to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it used to be incredibly productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the temperate areas,
it was a mollusk soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the soils were in
tropical grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to learn about that,
but we're focused here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we go to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is newly desertified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seriously the most seriously
degraded lands are desertified,
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hatching is where this is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Google image, we're working
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the Gobi Desert, Mongolia,
Taklamakan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, and this is actually the
Yellow River.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big river that runs through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the area is seriously desertified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working right here, Yinchuan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's Beijing over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mongolia is just north of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's this beautiful river running
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the landscape looks like this,
and literally aeolian dunes, blowing sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were there, it rained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it rained again about a week
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you have something growing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we began to realize, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is agriculture since almost at least
1,000 to 2,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the landscape now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we went to a museum, there were
petroglyphs of grassland animals on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became like, oh, this used to be a
grassland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, where's the organic
matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent an interesting couple days
driving around trying to get them to show
[SPEAKER_00]: us where there was some organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had real communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, we take all that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that to cook with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that to heat with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't leave that on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a week almost to find the
tiniest little layer of organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, this has been so
degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost track of what that was and
what its role was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our project became, well, wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a lot of pieces in it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really focused on was, well,
can you revitalize this system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we restore that grassland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some way to jumpstart the whole
system instead of just waiting for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly recover?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to use amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try and jumpstart the system to a
better level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can we help increase their
adoption?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either healthier crop lands that don't
require a lot of irrigation or
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sustaining grassland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the underlying question,
you're going to see this continues
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout this issue of they didn't quite
know what we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's the goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal goal to me as an ecologist is,
well, we want that nice healthy grassland
[SPEAKER_00]: back with all those animals and all that
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we even figure out what that was
given getting data is pretty hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's a feasible target?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's even realistic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we don't mean restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we mean revitalization or
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we really need to think carefully
about what these words mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the elements, and I think
of it as a recipe, the ingredients of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes that we're going to use to achieve
that target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil amendments, this is your guy's
world, been used for thousands of years
[SPEAKER_00]: from manure, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they either get mixed into the soil or
they get put on top of the soil and mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: and compost, manure, organic matter,
and fine and coarse woody material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chose to use coarse woody material
from the beginning because we said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we need this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put in iceberg lettuce, it's gone in
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need organic matter that's going to
stick around a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, we'll go with coarser
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also said, we're going to look at
something different, a different piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at branches,
where we apply, not just mixing it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, but we're going to look at
surface application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve Morielli, who is a zoologist and
has been studying for 10 years the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of forest practices on amphibians,
reptiles, animals, here, here,
[SPEAKER_00]: down there, are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now they're clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they take out trees and all,
they take every branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grind it up and make article
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were looking for evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you kind of need these piles of
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have all these different data on
what animals use them as refugia and
[SPEAKER_00]: germination and tree growth and deer can't
get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the relevant one was that they looked
at water content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at sites that had a pile
of branches and bare soil and consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: had more water retained in the soil over
time when the branches were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want more water to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first thing we did was a
simple experiment with a honors student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's honors undergrads are basically
master students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other places, we have amazing students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a very simple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we went back to China, we said,
we've got to make sure this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a very sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an artificial constructed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't bring the soils over from
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we did was mix in varying amounts
of organic matter of wood chips of
[SPEAKER_00]: populace, tremulacea, zero with the
control, 2%, 4%, 10% on a weight per
[SPEAKER_00]: weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried different species, populace,
black locust, willow, cattails.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all present over where we are in
Ningxia, biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put surface twigs as kind of a
proxy for having branches over the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: at five replicates, put 100 milliliters on
top, and then weighed it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see is these are the days
after water is added, one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much of that 100 milliliters is
still left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Percent water remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black line on the bottom is the
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, water is evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less water remaining with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these lines represents the
average of one of those treatments all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to, we're going to focus on
populace for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is 4% populace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after two weeks, we had 18% more water
in the soil that hadn't evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we added the literal on top,
we could get a few more percent water
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reduced evaporation by adding wood
chips to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had more water for longer, up to a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still were having the same kind of
retention in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it did was control evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used that as the basis for going to
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had two technicians working there,
who then the first one, Zhigang,
[SPEAKER_00]: turned this into his PhD thesis,
repeated the experiment, but in kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual soil over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 99% sand, no organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The twigs on the top is equivalent to the
lattice of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's two, five, eight increasing amounts
of populace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have populace alba, a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's planted over all of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is four different species of wood,
different tree species, manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's all the different treatments
with five replicates each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked at a whole bunch of things,
infiltration rate, microbial respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil capillarity, pore space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at soil, bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point being, that was set up very
similar to what we just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He weighed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put here infiltration rate instead
of all the other data, because right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was affecting another property,
another process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is control, and twigs were up on top,
so this was control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any kind of amendment addition,
reduced infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was less water leaching out of
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have another mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, all right, pause here for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this was like a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wood absorbs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put wood in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds the water, slowly releases it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out people are really questioning
the mechanisms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're putting more time into trying
to understand what are the precise
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, when I have
branches on top of the soil, it's surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: it shades, so that reduces heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also affects the boundary layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, evaporation is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood chips in the soil apparently are,
we think, breaking up the flow paths,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the water's ability to evaporate is
interfered with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't tested my idea that the water
is just absorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is absorbing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's now a whole complex of
mechanisms that may be all acting
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebecca?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the water actually applied?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the experiment, the first experiment
was literally 100 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a closed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in 25 mill increments, slowly,
at the very beginning of the evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: From high?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just poured it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we also are interested in
what's happening below the soil in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that, this was Jagann's thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that very complex experiment,
he also halfway through added seeds to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat seeds and showed that he could,
and we could affect how much growth there
[SPEAKER_00]: was of wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding amendments to it, you could
affect how much wheat growth we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the time factor between when you
applied the water and then measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first experiment was applied one time,
just 100 mills, one time, and it ran for a
[SPEAKER_00]: month, about four and a half, five weeks
total.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He added it at regular intervals once he
added the wheat to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hold on exactly how much water he added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took that and said,
all right, well, let's look what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the work in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just very controlled
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we set up in Ningxia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the system we're working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything back here is irrigated with a
drip tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five replicates of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one suite that was not irrigated
at all and one that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we set that up originally because it
rained so little.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, well, if it never rains,
we'll have new data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll irrigate one half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were 40 plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Howard was very helpful in getting the
design of this set up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the control soil, the unamended
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is with wood chips of populace
alba mixed in to the top 20 centimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, 5% by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the chips plus this lattice of
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 30% cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see light throughout hitting
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a surface mulch
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is temperature over one growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the original things we
saw in the Arnot forest work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, here are the controls in
black hitting above 40 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add chips, then surface mulch,
and the chips plus the branches to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall temperatures by almost 20
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could definitely keep the system
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, when you have amendment on the
surface, it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even just having chips in the soil
reduces the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also did what we hoped it would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped to maintain, helped to capture
more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the rain event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the chips plus the branches over
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the rain event occurs,
it captures more rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it stays moisture for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the same plots for 2015,
four years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which look pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is soil water storage over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the branches plus the chips
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is the chips and this
is the mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the mulch did better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the chips did better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branches plus the chips always did way
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, over the course of a whole
summer, and then four years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't changed anything, we still have
the same improvements in the system to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture and hold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had 150 millimeters of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are tiny amounts of rainfall over
the course of this growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we said, well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what you normally get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at a 15-year record and found
what the average amount of rainfall was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at, well, how does that
come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in as 21 events, all rain events,
that last for about one and a half days,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small amounts, eight millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key is how many days before the
next rain event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we only consider rains bigger than one
millimeter, drop the number of events and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase it to 5.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's tiny amounts of rain,
but it comes at every four to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why that's important, we're trying to
think, well, how do you translate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we calculated what the permanent
wilting point was for the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: using a very conservative estimate,
and said, in each of those situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: these were all irrigated, these are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2012 and 2015 for the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, the days in justice out
in that sediment, that sandy soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have 50 between 30 and 50 days where
the soil is below the permanent wilting
[SPEAKER_00]: point with that rainfall pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those irrigated situations,
which got more water, all the amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: helped us to reduce irrigation demand,
the number of days below permanent wilting
[SPEAKER_00]: point as compared to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would make a difference if you put
chips in the soil, you can reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the non-irrigated, where you now know
it's just the rainfall pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't make a difference with just the
chips, but both mulch, there was only four
[SPEAKER_00]: reps here, there were five reps there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both the mulch and the chips plus the
mulch are significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could definitely reduce, under
non-irrigated conditions, the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are really dry, guys,
170 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking 60 days where it's below
the permanent wilting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we can make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of other things were measured,
including soil microbial respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enzyme activity, soil carbon,
microbial carbon, microbial nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what you see is the control
and mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch does a really good job at keeping it
moist, but underneath the soil bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria don't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so adding the chips actually increased
the life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way we like to think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever we had wood in the soil,
in both the experiment and in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're increasing the whole system's kind
of living, functioning below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that in 2013, in the middle of
the summer, we had moths and mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the branch chip treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's moths, we have mushrooms in the
middle of the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2016, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were up there working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under a couple of the piles,
we go, what are those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out they're long-eared
hedgehogs, families living back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of that dry, deserty area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had set up homes underneath those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so overall, it's a healthier,
more living system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things are working better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been difficult working in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't bring soils back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the money we have is really coming
from the Chinese government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made it hard to do experiments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, we need to find something we
can work in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northern Great Plains Research
Laboratory, which is one of the longest
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an LT8ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has about 100 years of data for an
agricultural station.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harold recommended talking to Dr. Mark
Riebig, who said, yeah, come.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the midgrass prairie in North
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's totally cool about this is that
the climate in North Dakota is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what we get in Ningxia,
China, in terms of both the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: North Dakota's in blue with a high and low
for each month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is Ningxia, China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very comparable, both in
temperature and precipitation patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soils are really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have 93% sand, very little
organic matter, high pH, different
[SPEAKER_00]: texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we now have the same climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what can we do to that soil to make
it more similar to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it a healthier system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to revitalize this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did an experiment there,
the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, well, here's no amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are called calipershow,
sandy loam soils here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added chips to the soil, ratios plus
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of the summer,
biometric water content, we used decagon
[SPEAKER_00]: probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the rain events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is these are the average
for each treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the control soil moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we added chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added chips to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the branch plus chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our colleagues, they were very
surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they didn't really expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think this would make any
difference at all, that we could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Mark said is, well, actually,
our soils are on the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep up with the same practices we
have right now, we won't have more
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they change what we grow,
change the practices, we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like the west and south of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had gone west and south,
this would be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't need to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, it was really insightful to know
that, oh, we can even improve what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in that region right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because we had access to the
soils, we started asking some other
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Erin Mendez, who's a doctoral student
working with Todd Walter and us at BEE,
[SPEAKER_00]: started looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very interested in nutrient
pollution and used the calipershow soils
[SPEAKER_00]: as the basis to say, well, what happens if
we want to fertilize, can the wood chips
[SPEAKER_00]: affect how much nutrients leach out of the
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much nitrogen and phosphorus leach out
of the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did an experiment, and she looked
at liquid fertilizers, dry fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated surface fertilizers,
and compared with no chips, with chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much nitrogen and phosphorus leach
out of the system, giving the chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the role?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the basis for her
thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's also really starting to look
into this issue of what's the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've come up with a really clever
idea of using rubber mulch, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is disgusting, but you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically wood chips, only it's
rubber chips, so they don't absorb water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do some experiments
using rubber chips versus wood chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get a better handle on what
these mechanisms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what she's doing as part of her
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the core program of what
we've been doing, but there's these other
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one, and this is when I said
the benefit of using wood chips is the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of an ecological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're over there, every morning
there's condensation due on all the cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably, I don't know, several
miles away from the Yellow River,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a desert, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, wait a minute,
if there's condensation, everybody reports
[SPEAKER_00]: water availability is inches of rain,
centimeters of rain, but maybe this can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an experiment growing three
kinds of grass, prairie grasses under
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled conditions where weighing them
at night, weighing them in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how much water condensed,
putting lids on so they couldn't condense
[SPEAKER_00]: any water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, again, I'm giving you a
very short synopsis of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through condensation each night,
the grasses capture 23%, up to one case
[SPEAKER_00]: 46%, of the water they lost in daily
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also showed in a different small study
that they reduce evaporative loss at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking 170, 180 millimeters a
year in the growing season, being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture water through dew, it's really
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now grasses, this is the most exciting
part for me, grasses are really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all these dense stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perfectly, if you think about it,
it's like a forest of stems, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, how do they photosynthesize?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the point is they can capture water,
it can run down, it doesn't evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're evolved to capture dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you don't have a grassland,
you've lost a key mechanism that was
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to the system's ability to
capture and hold moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you've really got to think about
what you're going to grow if you restore
[SPEAKER_00]: that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as an ecologist, guys, we've got to
get grasses growing back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some work with what species in
northern China, Agripyron, Mongolia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning grasses, but we can
definitely improve grass growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's difficulties getting them started,
but once we get them up and running,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get more grass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second area, and this is me,
I've been arguing this one all along and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep going, is it's about the
ingredients of the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you put in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it's coarse wood chips,
a little bit of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of the work that Zhigan did,
needed fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pure sands doesn't have anything in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am arguing, well, guys, we can put
all this stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so recently there's been a lot of
attention on the fact that wood decomposes
[SPEAKER_00]: at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, it's like I say
iceberg lettuce disappears in a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: but woods really vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used populous tremoloides,
aspen, 50% gone, the K rate's about one to
[SPEAKER_00]: two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely noticed by 2015,
our wood was disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those wood chips, that experiment either
needs to be revitalized, but we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: quite what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are bunches of species that
decompose very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black locust is the one I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers will tell you, you want to put
fence posts in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in black locust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll last for 80 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if we use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What could it do in our restoration
recipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue of carbon sequestration is key
for mitigating climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ratan Lal and a bunch of people have put
out estimates of where can we use
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands as a key for dealing with
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil restoration is a piece of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People haven't done much with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We argue, well, you could put black locust
into the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an undergrad honors student,
Mariela Garcia, one of your guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might know her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some simple static alkali
chambers, quantified CO2 production from
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a tally per shale soil with and
without populous chips and with and
[SPEAKER_00]: without locust chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure, and then we had a whole
bunch of different treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one had nitrogen fertilizer added
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, locust, same amount,
decomposed, put out less CO2 than the
[SPEAKER_00]: populace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we argue, you can add locust to the
recipe, and we can sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 10% volume to volume amendment would
give you 1.7 kilograms of carbon for each
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter, 0.2 meters deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 17,000 kilograms per hectare of
carbon sequestered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take you 20 trees, 15 centimeters
in PBH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas we're talking about, we could do an
incredible amount of carbon sequestration
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll sit there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third piece started two summers ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because the Chinese government
said, well, what would this do for saline
[SPEAKER_00]: soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were kind of overwhelmed,
but OK, let's see what we can come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, all right, we'll do a test of
the wood chips, and we're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they're flat, all that salt's
accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be irrigated, but we'll put it
in a ridge and furrow system with
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation along the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put wood chips in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the soils look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys we work with, they work big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about 10 acres of this set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the drip irrigation tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went back, and there was no
amendment, and they were starting things
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is goji berry is endemic,
is native to this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's what it looks like in the
salty soil, even with drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it looks like in five
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a complete crop of sunflowers,
and goji berry is a shrub, so it took a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, oh, now, we don't know if
it's diluting the salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's bonding to the salt
through cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of more questions that have
to be asked, but it definitely suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: took this land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's using irrigation, which I'm
trying not to do that, but still,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to feed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly, this land that was
totally unusable is now being put into
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we are right now, the most recent
work, it's back at that original issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the goal, and how do you get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was lucky enough working with
Harold, and then Kirsten, and there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new initiative to look at soil
holistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for farmers, it's not just,
well, what's your nutrient status?
[SPEAKER_00]: MPK, here, add some fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gee, how healthy is the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a holistic look at all different
properties, active carbon, all different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of thinking about looking at the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us a diagnostic tool to look at a
degraded grassland soil and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what does it need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're saying, oh, we're going to
use that as the basis of the assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: and diagnosis of these degraded soils,
and then help us to determine the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went to the, we're starting in
the tall grass prairies, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: richest, wettest, and what I can tell,
mollusks are the ones that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on west, it gets drier,
it gets a little bit more confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kirsten has joined the graduate
program in my department and working with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, she's a master's student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went out this fall in August and
collected soils from relic prairies and in
[SPEAKER_00]: an adjacent field, agricultural field,
as a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 300 samples from five
different pairs and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting take home methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what she'll be doing as the
basis of her master's is doing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health analysis holistically and then
saying, okay, we know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see how it
compares to the ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we do to restore this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to go west and start
looking like in North Dakota and further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the interesting things came out
of this was one, it wasn't so easy to find
[SPEAKER_00]: like virgin prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they may still be there, but what we
found is little remnants in the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's farm who didn't want to,
it was a good enough to grow things on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few that were being
preserved, but they were still actually
[SPEAKER_00]: not, they were still hanging them or
having livestock use them, even in
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came down to, well, they're not
really virgin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't tilled as far as anybody can
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's available out there hasn't been
tilled in our memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of this issue of,
well, what's the ideal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did they used to look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a kind of informal census just for
fun and talking to people at restaurants,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is tall grass prairies,
best soils in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many knew what a prairie or
grassland was?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like six of nine did not even know
what those words meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, I mean, when you're there,
all you see is cornfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of miles were driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my God, this is nothing but
cornfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had forgotten, they didn't even
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the scientists we work with don't
really know what these should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the ideal, I mean,
this may be the best we get for what an
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go again in the spring and
sample more North and North Dakota and
[SPEAKER_00]: South Dakota tall grass prairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is the best that currently
exists, but it's not what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten some publications out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finally getting those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some real good achievements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran a special session at the Soil
Science Society last 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been designated as the flagship
project by China for this USDA MOST
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in, a bunch of you actually agreed
to collaborate for this global $100
[SPEAKER_00]: million global challenge last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made the top 200, honorable mention,
think it's 100 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were listed as one of the top three
most collaborative programs between the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much we don't know,
don't understand, but it shows great
[SPEAKER_00]: promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts of it work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm open to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm hoping I'm stimulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you all know all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's coming from a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, if you think of things you
want to talk about, email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the whole interpretation of that
epiphany for me, the whole world used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be grasslands, and it's all ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you teach this in 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Often, the limiting nutrient in
agricultural soil was nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you put wood chips into the soil of
microbes, grab the nitrogen, and you
[SPEAKER_07]: compose wood chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how that works out.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly, our first paper we put
together, our literature review,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, there's not that many studies that
have actually looked at wood in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, they'll call them even
green compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a mixture of things, not
well-designated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've seen conflicting results about
whether you get nitrogen immobilization in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the experiment Zhigong did,
we saw nitrogen drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not clear cut that it always
happens in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that's why, for the recipe,
you're going to have to add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that issue, when we're doing the
review, C to N ratio varies, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 to 20, 1 to 15, 1 to 10 for woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sawdust, in the four papers I read,
is 500 to 1 carbon and nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 to 1 for sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to understand, why does
locust take 80 years to even compose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not going to get nitrogen
immobilization if it's a slow decomposing
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ours are so coarse that,
actually, the bacterial function is slowed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not as clear cut as people think
when you're working with coarse wood put
[SPEAKER_00]: under the soil, from what I can tell from
the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But believe me, I'm paying close
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody gets why sawdust is 500 to
1, I mean, they do these studies where
[SPEAKER_00]: they add sugar to see if respiration
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put in sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 500 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what kind of sawdust?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sawdust is mostly thylon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't include the bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even still, when I look at the
literature for thylon versus the other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the bark, it's not 500 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether the fine scale of it,
and they're actually getting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the literature, when we put it
together, that's what I got out of
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the C to N immobilization issue is on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we have to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about your thinking about the
source of the wood for scaling this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume it would be some drip irrigation
or select locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody keeps saying, oh, wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in China, about 20 years ago,
because of erosion, they set up a program
[SPEAKER_00]: of planting trees across all the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all populous alba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be one individual populous alba
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with this very influential
person who said, look, just give us every
[SPEAKER_00]: third tree and grow something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all along the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easily cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut it, bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of wood available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it needs to be diversified for a bunch
of vulnerability and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have access to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like coming out here, there's hardwoods
along creek beds and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, again, you might have to
look to grow, for me, black locusts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it near the farm fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sequestering carbon while you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually coppice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with the poppies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut it, keep it growing,
and have a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, people, oh, nobody would do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would cost so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or bring it in on trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is they put a bridge in your
house that has 20 homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two other roads people can pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other bridge, it cost them $2
million for one bridge to 20 homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you can be $1 million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how much wood I can move
across the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much land I can restore in South
Dakota?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nothing, one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four years later, we're still having
benefits from the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow grass, and you give it
four years to actually start to get up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running, then it sequesters carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people keep saying grassland
sequester carbon once they're up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting them up and running is the
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing hedgerows of black locusts and
populous are what I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then move it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you aiming to use this to create crop
land, or are you trying to restore this as
[SPEAKER_03]: grassland?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an ecologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm an ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for quite a while, we were trying to
get a grassland back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they said is, listen,
we have five times the population in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't worry about feeding them next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worry about feeding them tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to have to make food of some
kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you right now,
they will never have a natural grassland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I think you have to have grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to irrigate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can get it to a grass and not
have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Ryan's talking a little bit about
perennial grains and crimping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have livestock limited grazing,
if you put the right ones in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofuel in the US, switchgrass is being
used, which is a native Panicum brigatums,
[SPEAKER_00]: a native grass, very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a basis for biofuel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have other grass options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to anything but grasses,
you get the soil growing and jumpstart
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can grow crops, it's going to
degrade again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having the grasses supplying the
system, even the locusts, it will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, apparently, China, as of three
years ago, was not into biofuels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really interesting, what they
called first-generational biofuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in second-generational biofuels,
they're starting to consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our group might be able to compare
and then some to start as a way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out on the landscape, which then
support birds and wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's got a role, Panicum
brigatum, or the comparable species over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want grasses back, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a little early for this,
but as someone who studies water,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you thought about the implications of
water staying there for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and perhaps recharging aquifers over a
long period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Ningxia, the Yellow River is the
only source of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city where there's 2 million
people, it's considered almost a town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many people are there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are sucking water out of the
river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it now runs dry in parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the government says, look,
you can't take that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the alternative is, like in India,
like here, they're switching to
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're putting in wells everywhere
and sucking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't get how limited water is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just intriguing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, we could get grasses growing
and this whole phenomenon of condensation,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much more water you might start to
build into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all this pressure for water
being pulled out of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would at least maybe buffer some of
that, but until there's a more holistic
[SPEAKER_00]: look about how the world uses water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, to me, if we can just reduce
irrigation demand, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say that all the time,
if you need to go, please go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we'll continue with questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make a comment because
when we were out there, and Rebecca didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mention it, but what the Chinese
government is doing in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: re-vegetation, at least at the time,
they have about 2,000 people go out into
[SPEAKER_01]: the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put these little waste troughs in in
about one square foot, maybe, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they put one seedling of a desert grass in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 2,000 people, they only have about
two months out of the year that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough water for the seedling to even
establish itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 60, 70% of them die anyway in the
subsequent summer because it's too
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they cover, without 2,000
people, they cover maybe a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares, maybe this all manual effort of
putting the little rice troughs in just to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the environment slightly less harsh
and to produce the wind erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying, but you can't in the
long term have that kind of an approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just the labor needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're kind of keeping that up a
little bit, but it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a much more efficient way
of doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is not there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't said, gee, what's the
chemistry of the rainfall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you also need to add these because
you're never going to get it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gotten to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what it's worth, we're just,
oh, it's kind of like, oh, the soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment gives us the diagnostic tool to
figure out the ingredients that are
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about where we are in person will
be where we're going to look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: linkage if that's the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really feeling our way little bit by
little bit for how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one of the experiments, it didn't do
a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was putting it on at the rates
of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had very high electrical
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened, but we got
much lower growth of the wheat in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: less bacterial development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't help the soil properties as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that sewage could be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my sense of compost and manure is they
tend to decompose more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this saying, we need to need
stuff that eight years from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff's not gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get to replenish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't, again, it's a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the right thing to add to
give us the nutrient piece we need,
[SPEAKER_00]: some readily decomposable material,
plus some things that are more slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a good part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the whole sewage thing depending on
where it comes, if it's mixed with
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial waste, you have, oh,
then they're having metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whole worries, whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually talked to Janice about we need
a microbial inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so barren.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show up, but they hired actually
a geneticist who did an entire analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of the soil microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were all the things you find in
our grasslands are there at very small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts, including there's this one that's
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Sierra, documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native grasslands have this, are dominated
by Borucomicrobial is the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dominate in healthy native
grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, oh, there they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know that we need a microbial
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compost tea, Janice recommended,
could be a way to bring that in if we need
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, these people become good
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, there was more language and I
didn't learn Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to learn the symbols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our team are looking for where to
speak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spoke it and they're getting better
and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely affected our ability to
function scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go once a year, sometimes twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we communicated things one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not what we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your distance and all those things
affected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is this woman's
very influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we convince them it works, the Chinese
government will just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, everybody, we're changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually kind of like the Beijing
Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had all this algae show up along the
shore right before they had the boating
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 10,000 people go out with buckets
and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, oh, we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could actually change a very big
chunk of landscape using this if we prove
[SPEAKER_00]: it works and it's successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is that going to hurt my crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some bugs going to show up in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to say, oh, we haven't
looked at that.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North Dakota, we go, nobody's going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to make them do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to convince them to
put in demonstrations, provide subsidies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole schmear, it's actually going to
be harder to get it to happen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States than it will in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's underpinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, I think, we'll make headway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buying in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's going to be a slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning prairie grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a grass person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a wetland specialist on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an awful lot about grasses
that is conducive to preventing erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These networks of roots, these deep roots,
they're there through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are definitely using tree planting as
a restoration technique over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're irrigating like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have that kind of network
of roots that form a sod, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about different
species of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so particularly, I guess, I'm trying
to figure out what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tropical grasslands, they probably
don't have these organic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they different grasses that really can
handle dry periods and they go dormant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think grasses are evolved more on paying
attention to both the above ground
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and then below ground,
multiple ways to deal with not having
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're probably helping with the
whole erosion phenomenon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

Thank you.
