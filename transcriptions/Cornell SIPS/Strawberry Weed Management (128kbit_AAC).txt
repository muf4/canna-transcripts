[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start with Dr. Marvin
Pritz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Pritz holds a faculty position at
Cornell that has research and teaching and
[SPEAKER_03]: extension responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the primary extension liaison for
the New York State Berry producers and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's also the chair of the Department of
Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get his talk up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before Dr. Pritz starts I do want to let
you folks know that I have enabled you to
[SPEAKER_03]: put the full screen on so that you can do
that if you'd like or you can keep it as a
[SPEAKER_03]: shorter screen and I'm sorry we seem to
have lost the chat box so let me see if I
[SPEAKER_03]: can get that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright so now we have the ability for you
folks to ask questions during the
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also just put the full screen on
and just listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay well happy Halloween everybody and we
want to talk today about weed management
[SPEAKER_00]: in berries and it's a topic that we get
lots and lots of questions about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some work on budgeting in
strawberries and we find that managing
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds is the greatest expense that
strawberry growers incur except for
[SPEAKER_00]: actually harvesting the fruit and some
times when we've done analyses we found up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 70% of the labor costs that growers
spend involves weed management and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is because we grow our strawberries
under matted rows and we have fields like
[SPEAKER_00]: this that are pretty much bare,
fallowy, put our little strawberry plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and then we hope that they
produce from others during the year and
[SPEAKER_00]: fill in but when you look at that field
you find that there's lots of bare ground
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of opportunities for weeds to
come in during that time that strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to grow and establish
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the problems we have are in that
first year where there's a lot of bare
[SPEAKER_00]: ground in the strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a whole lot of very good
herbicides although that's changing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit now more recently we've gotten
some materials that Dr. Belinder is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to share with you in a few minutes but
we're going to talk about matted rows
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all this bare ground,
people go and they cut the flowers off to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage the runners to fill in,
the runners fill in between the rows but
[SPEAKER_00]: again even during these first several
months there's a lot of bare ground out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and a lot of opportunities for weeds
to establish themselves particularly when
[SPEAKER_00]: we irrigate and water the ground in
between the strawberries and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally get lots of weeds growing
between the rows and even more weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: growing between the rows and then this is
when we get calls from growers and all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of people that say what can I do
I've got weeds in my strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's often pretty late to do much
about it by then but that's often times
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get the call so what we want to do
today is sort of think about some ways we
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to manage our weeds without
waiting until we get to a point like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fumigation is something that used to
be a little bit more popular than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason for that is that
fumigation methyl bromide in particular is
[SPEAKER_00]: being phased out and it's becoming very
expensive so growers that used to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a weed management practice are finding
well it's just a little bit too expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to do that plus the plastic is
difficult to dispose of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black plastic mulches are used in a
lot of annual production systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a photograph from Florida where
they use black plastic and that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: control the weeds too but one of the
problems with that is is a disposal
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and I don't know what it's like in
your state but just this month in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: they passed a law that saying you can't
burn anymore no open burning and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers would dispose of their plastic by
open burning so we can't do that anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: so this material is left to accumulate if
you don't have a way to recycle it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: did some calculations a couple years ago
for a presentation I was going to give and
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that strawberry growers alone
use enough plastic each year to circle the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth 13 times so that's a lot that's a
lot of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question that we're interested in
is are there ways of preventing weeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries without using a lot of
plastic without using fumigation without
[SPEAKER_00]: using a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really three strategies pretty
obvious one is deplete the weed seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent seed dispersal to the field in
other words try not to get weeds into the
[SPEAKER_00]: field before you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly prevent germination and or
establishment once you have the berries in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and then thirdly remove weeds
that appear and unfortunately most people
[SPEAKER_00]: wait till that third step and then try to
figure out how to remove weeds that appear
[SPEAKER_00]: without putting a lot of effort into the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the experiments we did a few years
ago was looking at replant disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and we had an old strawberry
field we took it out of strawberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we planted eight different treatments
into that old strawberry field and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: planted strawberries after these two-year
rotations in between the strawberries so
[SPEAKER_00]: for example we had mowed wheaty fallow,
fumigation, alfalfa, mustard, kale sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: corn raw you can read the treatments up
there and we also had continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry and then we took these cover
crops out and we planted strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: again and have a lot of data here on how
these plants responded and root pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything like that but I just wanted
to show you the data on the weediness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatments after these cover crops and
this would be in the first year that
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first column you see is sort of a
methyl bromide fumigation treatment this
[SPEAKER_00]: is about as good as it gets when you
fumigate and then plant your strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few weeds and some of the
treatments had a lot of weeds like when
[SPEAKER_00]: you go right in with strawberries and
follow strawberries again or you'll mow
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't do anything except mow the weeds
that doesn't really help a lot but what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to point out was that some of these
treatments like kale sweet corn rye
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation or rotation of mustards did a
pretty good job at managing weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing weeds in that first year and
it was certainly a lot less expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot less environmental impact than
methyl bromide fumigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we wanted to ask
ourselves or several questions but when
[SPEAKER_00]: you have weeds in strawberries like how
much weed growth is acceptable?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much can a grower tolerate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the only good weed a dead weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there times when weed growth can be
tolerated and there are times when weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are very competitive with strawberry
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we try to answer that question
was we took a first year strawberry field
[SPEAKER_00]: and we divided it up into plots and we had
weeds growing in those plots for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths of time and for specific months of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example we had weeds growing just
during the month of June and then for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the season we removed the weeds by
hand just for the month of July just for
[SPEAKER_00]: August just for September and then we had
combinations of two months and then
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of three months and then we
had weeds all year long and then we let
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberries go through the winter and
in the following season in the first year
[SPEAKER_00]: we harvested the plants to see what impact
the weeds in the first year had on yields
[SPEAKER_00]: the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are weedy and some aren't and these
are the data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you read this is if there's an X
that means weeds were present in each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those months and so here we have weeds
present June, July, August, and September
[SPEAKER_00]: basically all year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants the following year those
plots produce one runner and 292 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and you can see how this was set up
three months, two months, one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I want to do is look at
the one month periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are weeds in June, weeds just in
July, just in August, and just in
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over here and look at runner
production and we can see that the later
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds were present the more runners we
had in the same way with yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields were higher if the one month of
weed pressure was late in a season
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to one month early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do the same thing when we look at a
two month period of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are weeds in June and July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at our yield a little over a
thousand grams per plot but if we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: same two months of weed pressure but later
in the season our yields were two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half times as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the same pattern with runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more runners when the weeds were
late compared to when the weed pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: was early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do the same thing for three
months of weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little yield but when the three
months of weed pressure was later about
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four times as much yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done this experiment for a
couple of different years and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clear that in first year plantings early
season weed pressure is much worse than
[SPEAKER_00]: late season weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting the weeds out of those first
year plantings early really can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds later in the season not so much of
an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you keep those weeds out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we did it by hand but that's a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other ways that you can use
cultivation to remove weeds early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season when they're most problematic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there are lots of different tools out
there to manage weeds and strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: growers tend to use a rototiller and
herbicides but there's some other tools
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that look like they might have
some potential in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see how those work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a standard way that growers
cultivate their strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a multivator, rototiller,
get down the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with that device is that
on the downside on the down stroke it
[SPEAKER_00]: compacts the soil and makes a compacted
layer about six inches down and on the up
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke it just brings weed seeds up to the
surface and lets them germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be better is if you could do
some shallow cultivation where you're only
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating the first couple of inches
rather than all the way down and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these tools do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These finger weeders shallowly cultivate
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are onions not strawberries but
you can see the principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets right up close to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flex tine harrows shallowly
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bring weed seeds up to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just drive this device relatively
quickly over the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tines vibrate back and forth and
knock the small weeds out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something called a Reggie Weeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this works is you sit in the
back here and you pull along and you
[SPEAKER_00]: straddle the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the operator pulls these wheels in and
out and they spin the weeds out from
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just move it in and out as you
get down the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this device here spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it only cultivates real
shallowly and it doesn't bring weed seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had real good luck with that in
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also this device here which is
called a brush hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way this thing works is like a
giant street sweeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mounts in the back of a tractor and
these wheels spin and they spin the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out as you go over the row and straddle
the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it kicks up a little bit of dust that
settles back down onto the top of the row
[SPEAKER_00]: and it almost acts like a mulch layer of
dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see it sweeping through some
cabbage and it kicks up some dust that
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeps out the weeds and it makes this
layer of dust back in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the brush hoe after it's gone
over a young plant in the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's done a pretty good job of
sweeping out the weeds and it leaves this
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of dust on the top which seems to
prevent subsequent weeds from germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you some sequence of
photos here that look at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways that weeds have been
managed in first year strawberries using
[SPEAKER_00]: these different tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a weed management tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Devernal after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the strawberry rows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Devernal was applied and then that
was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walked away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several weeks later you come back and
you're getting some weeds going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if you do nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the standard way that
growers would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might use some Devernal but then they
would come in with a multivator and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and rototill between the rows and
of course that knocks down the weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're left with a situation like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty clean but it did use that
multivator and generally this area here
[SPEAKER_00]: will regrow weeds very quickly after
you're done multivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it rains again you'll get weeds
coming up in this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a flex tine harrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I showed you that
vibrates when you drive over the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It vibrates the small weeds out of the
ground and it does a pretty good job in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first several weeks after strawberries
are planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it keeps the planting really
clean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do anything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just drove over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the flex tine harrow every few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't let the weeds get too tall
or this won't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weeds have to stay small almost in the
cotyledon stage but it's a good way to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate shallowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty we found with this flex
tine harrow that once the runners start to
[SPEAKER_00]: form in the strawberry you can't use it
anymore because the runners get caught up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tines and we get lots of weeds at
the end of the season if we use this flex
[SPEAKER_00]: tine harrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stimulates a lot of weed
germination and we get lots of weeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll contrast that with the brush hoe
where this is early in the season and
[SPEAKER_00]: again very few weeds between the rows and
late in the season the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few weeds between the rows even
though these are not hand pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flex tine harrow stimulates weed
growth particularly after you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brush hoe seems to keep the weeds
suppressed a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably because of that layer of dust
that's formed on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some data on the weed biomass from
these different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multivator really knocks down the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get many weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flex tine harrow gave us lots of weeds
and you saw a photo of that before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when we use the flex tine harrow then
add herbicide we still get quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finger weeder did a pretty good job of
reducing weeds same as a brush hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herbicide alone doesn't give us a
whole lot of weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use an herbicide on a multivator
this is more or less the standard practice
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does keep the weeds down a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is how much does it cost to
do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times you have to go over the
field and what are your yields impacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the yields from the multivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable yields here but the yields are
even better with a finger weeder and some
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even this flex tine harrow if we use it
early on to keep the weeds out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: use an herbicide the yields are pretty
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember these plots were kind of weedy
but they were weedy at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season not at the beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we keep the weeds out at the
beginning of the season the yields can be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty high even if they're weedier later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go down here to the herbicide the
herbicide alone doesn't give you enough
[SPEAKER_00]: weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely get an impact on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just rely on herbicides to manage
our weeds and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to use some cultivation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a standard practice herbicide plus
the multivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the brush hoe and the finger
weeder were more expensive to use than a
[SPEAKER_00]: single herbicide application about a
thousand dollars each in terms of all your
[SPEAKER_00]: labor and costs and everything going into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are much more effective at
controlling weeds and a thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of strawberries isn't that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can easily make up for that by
using one of these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brush hoe was also more effective and
cheaper to run three hundred dollars for
[SPEAKER_00]: the year than standard cultivation because
it required far few passes only three
[SPEAKER_00]: passes through the field and two hand
weedings and no herbicides and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to keep the field really really
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with standard rototilling we had
to go through more times and we had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more hand weedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of a brush hoe is its
initial expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at another strategy and
that's planting strawberries through
[SPEAKER_00]: killed sods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than have a bare field where you
plant your strawberries and then you wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole year for those runners to
establish and you have all that bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is almost like no-till
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Establish a cover crop, kill the cover
crop plant the strawberries into that
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop and then see how well your
weeds is depressed and how well the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see different cover crops growing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of different types of
cover crops out here and so what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: was we grew these in the fall through the
winter the following spring we sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: them out and then we planted strawberries
in a narrow sort of ribbon row into these
[SPEAKER_00]: various mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see them going across here and
we looked at what happened after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a planting of us which was
killed sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added a little bit of straw to the
surface and we added some herbicide and
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-emergent herbicide and it keeps the
weeds down really really well for that
[SPEAKER_00]: first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to go in and cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go in and add additional
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a plot that had no herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just killed rye and the
strawberries are planted into that killed
[SPEAKER_00]: rye and it's very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very clean relative to some of these other
plots which are more treated normally with
[SPEAKER_00]: some cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nutsedge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this is nutsedge and it's a
pretty bad weed but you can see with this
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment here it does a pretty good job
of suppressing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again a close up of ribbon row and
killed rye residue and straw mulch put on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of that for the first year and this is
a second year planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see with no hand weeding,
no cultivation or anything, no herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: the second year the plants look pretty
darn good considering that we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole lot of weed input into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is something that we
can think about and growers should
[SPEAKER_00]: consider particularly as the cost of some
of these materials go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge has been planting these
strawberries into the killed sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do this by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the tines off a rototiller and
left one little one tine on there so we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do a little strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more recently they have some tools now
that actually can cut a groove into the
[SPEAKER_00]: sod and then plant no-till into these
killed sods and it works a lot better than
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the tools we used to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pretty new, pretty expensive but
the point is the technology is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: along that we ought to be able to do this
in a few years without a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last strategy I wanted to mention was
interplanted cover crops and this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: something you do after the strawberries
are growing for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again after harvest you renovate the
strawberries, you mow off the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cultivate in between the rows and then
again you have this bare ground situation
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of the season and you try to
keep the weeds out of and right after
[SPEAKER_00]: renovation you mow the leaves off,
you cultivate then the recommendation is
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in and put on cinbar or devernal
or some material to keep the weeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask ourselves the question why can't we
plant something between the rows that we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: rather have than a bunch of weeds and if
we plant that crop and it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: crowds out the weeds but then dies itself
it might not be so much of a problem to
[SPEAKER_00]: have something in there that dies off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a field where we have the
strawberry plants in an established bed
[SPEAKER_00]: and between the rows of strawberries we
planted Sudan grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant the Sudan grass after renovation
late July, early August, it grows up and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in late September, early October it
dies because of frosts come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the following season or actually
later on that year you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry rows, you have a bunch of dead
residue in between them from the Sudan
[SPEAKER_00]: grass but you don't have any weeds because
the Sudan grass displaced them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the following spring this residue
disappears over the winter or you mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants anyway with straw and the
following year you have a plant that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Sudan grass residue is
still here but it's relatively clean from
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some strategies that we've
used to think about managing weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries without relying so much on
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to review cover crops or crop
rotations to reduce weed pressure before
[SPEAKER_00]: planting we find that grain crops such as
sweet corn are really good in a rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: because a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is they have a very different growth
habit in strawberries so the weeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow between corn tend to be different
than those that might establish themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: in a perennial broadleaf plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus you can use herbicides on corn that
are aren't labeled for strawberries so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can clean things up pretty well with the
corn before you move into the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do a good cover crop rotation,
you're ready to plant the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that one or two applications of
Roundup before you plant strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: works well to kill the perennial weeds
because once you have strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: established it's very difficult to remove
weeds from them, particularly perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds because strawberries are a broadleaf
perennial plant and most of the weeds we
[SPEAKER_00]: have are broadleaf perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of selective products
that can remove the bad broadleaf weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave the broadleaf plant as you want
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly, focus attention early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have limited labor and limited time
the best use of that is to remove those
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds for the first two or three months
that the strawberries have been planted
[SPEAKER_00]: and not later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also looked at this in subsequent
years about managing weeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing established plantings and we
found the same thing that once the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are established weeds have very little
impact on subsequent yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might look bad and it looks like
there's lots of weeds in there but the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact they have on strawberries after
they're established, if you can keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds out that first year, get the
strawberries in the ground and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: well established, you can have weeds come
in and it won't impact your yield unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you have tremendous weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really good once they're
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some alternatives, planting
through those killed sods I showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: using some of these newer cultivation
tools that cultivate shallowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't compact the soil and don't bring
weed seeds to the surface, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a bunch of herbicides
that work as well and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about those in just one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep the areas mowed around the
plantings, don't allow weed seeds to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: into the planting from fields close by
that are producing weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this whole concept of using
inter-planted cover crops, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: with things like Sudan grass or oats,
things that winter kill, I think has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, are you able to use
less straw for winter mulch if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: Sudan grass inter-planted in the berries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, I think that would be the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is that the Sudan grass
actually, it doesn't hold up real well to
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter and part of that reason for
that is we don't let it get tall so it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get real woody and lignified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you plant it in early August and
it only grows two or three feet high,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not real woody so it does break down
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is it really helps hold the
straw on the rows even though it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to get by with less straw,
it does help hold it on the rows and keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: it from blowing off when you do mulch in
early December.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, Laura, why don't we put up
Robyn's presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some questions for Marvyn here
while I change things around a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the time to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quiet group today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must be Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some people typing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I'm doing the same problem I had
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get this back where it
needs to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we've got a few people typing so
why don't we just give them just a second
[SPEAKER_03]: and see if there's some questions for
Marvyn before I introduce Robyn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're typing a question
or if they're talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvyn, Jeff Hall asks if renovation would
be the same with sod ground as bare
[SPEAKER_03]: ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with the sod ground we actually
don't have sod between the rows of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sudan grass is an annual grass and
it's only planted after July and it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for a couple of months so it
doesn't really establish a sod like you
[SPEAKER_00]: might think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually dies off and that's why we
want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time fall comes we have some
residue on the ground but the Sudan grass
[SPEAKER_00]: is not living so it's not the same as sod
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for small farmers or their crops that
would grow well interspersed within berry
[SPEAKER_00]: rows I don't think so for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries are low to the ground and
anytime you plant something that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: shade strawberries don't like it and you
have the rows planted so close together
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway at four feet that I don't think it
would really make sense to plant something
[SPEAKER_00]: between strawberry rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're talking about blueberries
and the blueberries are small you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to think about that but not for
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn byproduct we used amaze corn
gluten meal as a pre-emergent herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out that in strawberries it works
quite well in a dry year but when it rains
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot and it's a wet year that corn gluten
meal also has a lot of nitrogen in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually made our weed problem worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can predict the weather you can
determine if it's good to use or not but
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in our situation anytime we had a
wet year we got more weeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer and the nitrogen in that
product than we did when we had a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I could jump in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a link to Robin's website that
gives sources of those pieces of
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation equipment and that's on the
final portion of this webinar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a link that Dr. Belinder has
there that you can get some more
[SPEAKER_03]: information about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our experience with different soil types
is somewhat limited you know I think
[SPEAKER_00]: stones are more of a problem than soil
type in our experience and I will say too
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we were looking at planting in
sort of killed sod sandy soils work a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better than heavier clay soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin do you have any comments on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah hold on a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can comment on the brush hose and the
different types of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially when we got the brush hose they
came from Europe and we were told that the
[SPEAKER_01]: guards were supposed to actually be run
one inch in the soil and you can't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: with stony soils which we have here at the
research farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we purposely raised the guards so that
they were above the rows by about an inch
[SPEAKER_01]: to an inch and a half which is one of the
reasons we get the dry movement of the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that creates that layer that doesn't
let the weeds emerge through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have not had any difficulties using
this machine on either stony or eel silt
[SPEAKER_01]: type soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we have run into is that when
they're very wet then the brushes pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: too much of the soil and it's very
difficult to clean them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another comment from Thomas Prouty
about Sargam Sudan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sargam helps with nematodes and better
soil health and thank you very much
[SPEAKER_03]: Thomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a question from Brent about of
the killed covers are there differences in
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit rot problems the following spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the killed covers are there differences
in fruit rot problems the following
[SPEAKER_00]: spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in terms of the fruit rot itself but
in the root rots yeah there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in pre-plant cover crop how
that affects root pathogens but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of we haven't found anything and I'm
not aware of data that show an effect of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-plant cover crop on fruit rots the
following spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move now into Dr.
Billender's presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Robin Billender holds a faculty
position with Cornell University in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Horticulture and she focuses
her research and extension programming on
[SPEAKER_03]: weed control in vegetable and fruit and
we're very happy to have her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's recently back from a trip to India
and Dr. Billender thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleased to have an opportunity to
visit with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say right up front that I only
picked up fruit in 2006 and I have been
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing largely on developing data to
support new registrations of herbicides
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly for the planting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: of strawberries and so what I will be
showing you today is some of the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been doing and are trying to move
into the registration process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see on the screen is a list of
the ones the herbicides which are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much currently registered for
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prowl H2O was just recently registered in
2007 and so some of you may not have had
[SPEAKER_01]: much opportunity to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's currently registered for a pre-plant
pre-transplant at least one day before
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting and then subsequently can be
used between rows as long as you leave 35
[SPEAKER_01]: days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal to excel is registered for use in
strawberries but it's a rather strange
[SPEAKER_01]: registration because it only allows use
pre-transplant 30 days and only in the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot be used subsequently which makes
it somewhat I think hard to imagine using.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to as you'll see later
working with the new product Gold Tender
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not yet registered in
strawberries and that has some other
[SPEAKER_01]: problems associated with registration but
we will talk a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chateau is now registered for
pre-transplant applications as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be done on plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also be used spring and fall when
the plants are dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously many of you have used Devonol,
some of you have used Daxol and some are
[SPEAKER_01]: unsure using Synbar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-emergence 2,4-D has been around
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: AIM is now registered as a pre-transplant
burndown or to row middles using
[SPEAKER_01]: protective shields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stinger is now registered on strawberries
which I think presents quite a good
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of weeds that can be
controlled with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Select, also now known as Select
Bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Max and Post can also be used for
specifically controlling post-emergence
[SPEAKER_01]: emerged grass weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently looking at this group of
herbicides for applications in new
[SPEAKER_01]: plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dual Magnum, I know you I'm sure have used
in other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflex has been relatively recently
registered in a number of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pre-emergence but it also has
residual activity as well as some
[SPEAKER_01]: post-emergence activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spartan is a new one which is currently
registered in Cabbage, not in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State and I'll talk a little bit more
about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goaltender, which is a flowable
formulation as opposed to an EC
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation of the Goal and tends to be
somewhat less injurious when it's applied
[SPEAKER_01]: post-emergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has somewhat less weed control
because of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is being moved forward slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caprol is an old product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually labeled on carrots in Canada
and we're trying, we're awfully close to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it registered on carrots in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a Triazine and so it has some of the
similar type characteristics in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed control as Atrazine and as Princep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chateau, which I have here as a new
evaluation, is already labeled for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to change the use pattern
somewhat on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Princep is being considered for
registration because it's been registered
[SPEAKER_01]: for many years in Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that it's going through a
re-registration process the company has
[SPEAKER_01]: indicated that we can move forward with
trying to get it used in other parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will just give you a couple of bird's
eye views of some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a trial that we actually planted
in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data I'm going to show you from
that are from that trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell what our weed pressures are
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hardly see the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Prawl H2O does a pretty nice job,
at least initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't last the full season but it
does a very good job initially and it does
[SPEAKER_01]: not hurt the strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are applied the day before
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the Dual Magnum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got three separate rates there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say these were applied the
day after transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see we have pretty good weed
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did see a little bit of injury at the
highest rate but it did not last long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, in a year like 2009 when we
repeated this but we put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-transplant and had huge rain events
very shortly after planting, we did see
[SPEAKER_01]: some significant stunting with the Dual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one has to be a little cautious as
we go forward with creating the right
[SPEAKER_01]: information for the companies to put the
information on the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there are certain times and certain
occasions when there's likely to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: injury than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Princep.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I have a correction to make on
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't catch this before we sent it to
Laura so she couldn't change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one on the far right where it says
Princep three times at .1 pounds active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient per acre is in fact not
Princep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Zinbar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one on the left is the application
rate which is currently used in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually put on either 30 days
pre-transplant or some people are putting
[SPEAKER_01]: it on in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, to dormant in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did see a little bit of early injury
with this but really not significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A colleague of mine, Brad Majek in New
Jersey who many of you I'm sure know has
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested that a better way to do this is
to apply Princep at three separate times
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly two weeks apart post-transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see in this picture there
is somewhat less stunting in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had almost no stunting with this
particular application.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zinbar applied at three separate
occasions which I understand from Marvin
[SPEAKER_01]: is done routinely in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our particular case did not cause much
in the way of injury but we also had grass
[SPEAKER_01]: control problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that the rate that that's
used at is a little bit marginal with
[SPEAKER_01]: regard to controlling grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Chateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right you have the traditional
application of three ounces applied 30
[SPEAKER_01]: days pre-transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2008 we had quite a bit of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have to say that that three
ounce rate even 30 days prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting caused as you can see there
significant injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Applied one day pre-transplant at one
third of the rate you can see that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: very little in the way of crop injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have excellent weed control with
both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on the left is Reflex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflex has a lot of potential for both pre
and particularly in strawberries
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-emergence activity on a lot of
troublesome broadleaf weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: However it can only be applied prior to
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And subsequent years it would have to be
applied to dormant plants because its
[SPEAKER_01]: post-emergence activity causes too much
injury for the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Goal Tender which is the slightly
safer version of Goal 2XL did a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see some injury in this but
overall it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also tried some rather strange
off-the-wall new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kixor is a product that is being marketed
by BASF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point they're not particularly
interested in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did find is that applied
pre-transplant in strawberries it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: does no harm at all to the berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It unfortunately has actually no activity
on grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you see there is grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bandura in the middle is a product used in
Europe on other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though Kixor and Bandura are the
same mode of action in terms of killing
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds you can see that they have very
different behaviors in terms of their
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity or their cytotoxicity because
Bandura actually totally killed the
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly I occasionally throw in
things that I use in other crops just for
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have Lorax on the far right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2008 you can see there's no injury
and really nice weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was applied immediately
pre-transplant day before.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009 however because as I mentioned
earlier with the Dual Magnum because we
[SPEAKER_01]: got a lot of rain shortly after the
transplanting we did see more injury this
[SPEAKER_01]: year with the Lorax than we did in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is one of two data tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I basically want to show you with
this one is hand weeding time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hand weeding time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole column.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you should see here is that for
example although we had very little in the
[SPEAKER_01]: way of injury here with the Dual with the
Prowl we did have relatively poor over the
[SPEAKER_01]: long haul weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result your hand weeding time is
quite high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Synbar on the other hand as I mentioned
where we have virtually no injury at all
[SPEAKER_01]: with those three applications we didn't
also have very good weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so although we have somewhat better
weed control than with Prowl by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should do it out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do still have an appreciable amount of
time in terms of hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Princep which had initial injury we
begin to see better weed control and now
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeding time comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chateau which has the absolute
shortest weeding time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very little time it took because it
was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the three days application or here it
is the three times application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry the one day before application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we still have excellent weed control
and very, very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping in mind this is the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a non fruiting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting extremely good weed
control and the hand weeding time as I
[SPEAKER_01]: said has come way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have it with the Dual Magnum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had again initial injury relatively
slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall pretty good weed control with all
of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weed control hand weeding time is
intermediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflex again we have very little in the
way of injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good weed control except for crab grass
because it doesn't control the grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hand weeding time is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course Kixor which had very
little in the way of injury had relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: poor weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our hand weeding time was back up
with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We move to our next data slide which is
this last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is yield data that was collected in
2007 from a transfer planting trial in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say that it was our first
time hand harvesting strawberries and it
[SPEAKER_01]: took forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I admire Marvin for all of the work he's
doing in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crew was real real concerned about the
amount of time we spent hand weeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: hand picking the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the yields I felt were relatively
variable both in terms of numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: runners per plant as well as the yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're highly variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The significance level is not particularly
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some trends in the sense that
here Chateau and Goaltender you did see
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly with Chateau a slight
reduction in the number of runners and
[SPEAKER_01]: also a reduction in the pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was with the case of Jewel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also saw here significant injury with
this and we also saw a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of yields per 20 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Early Glow again overall the trends
are not as noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one with the Goaltender you do see a
slight reduction in terms of total yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then looking at the idea of where some
of these might fit into your current
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, Prowl H2O at the top is
particularly good in controlling annual
[SPEAKER_01]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does also pick up Mustards,
Purslane and Pigweed species.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, I don't see this very often
in strawberry fields but Velvet Leaf is
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressed by it as is Lamb's Quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spartan which I haven't mentioned much up
until now is largely a broadleaf weed
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used pre-plants plant and it can also
be used in dormant crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you from other parts of the
country that are not in New York State you
[SPEAKER_01]: may see this registered already or it will
be registered soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The New York Department of Environmental
Conservation or the DEC has had some
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with FMC because they're not
happy with water tests and as a result FMC
[SPEAKER_01]: has not gone forward with registering it
yet in New York State so that remains a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit up in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chateau, we would like to see its rate
reduced so that we could use it the day
[SPEAKER_01]: before transplanting as opposed to waiting
for the 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also would like to go back and revisit
with the company why they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic on there because I think we can do
it with things without plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflex, as I mentioned, will be good
pre-transplant and subsequently in later
[SPEAKER_01]: years could be used as a dormant
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely good in controlling several
very difficult broadleaf weeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly ragweed, mustards,
pigweeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dual Magnum, we've been trying to
get that registered off and on for some
[SPEAKER_01]: time, particularly because it controls
nutsedge, annual grasses, gallon soga,
[SPEAKER_01]: it also does a good job on pigweeds,
suppresses nightshades and purslane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current registration status, we have done
the residues for getting PRINCEP
[SPEAKER_01]: registered and those will be going through
analysis this coming year so we expect
[SPEAKER_01]: registration on that in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dual Magnum, the 2008 trials are complete,
the residue trials have been done and we
[SPEAKER_01]: expect registration for that in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to conclude if there
are questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there are a couple of things,
Robin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kristen Callow asks, what is the active
ingredient in Reflex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the active ingredient in Reflex is
fomesophon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, it's called Flexstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a PPO inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's related to blazer and cobra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great, Kristen, hopefully that
answers your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question about the hand weeding
times, whether or not that is on a per
[SPEAKER_03]: acre basis, but I think it's actually on a
smaller basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a plot basis, that's 120 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thomas Prouty is wondering if Dual Magnum
will have activity on Henbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very little experience with Henbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is that it will not have much
activity on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, does anybody else have any questions
for either Marvin or Robin?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's somebody typing here and I'll wait
for Brent to finish typing and then we'll,
[SPEAKER_03]: if nobody else has any questions,
we'll move into the next phase,
[SPEAKER_03]: the final phase of the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be nervous, Brent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brent is actually asking me, how does soil
organic matter affect activity of some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these herbicides?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a factor with CINBAR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Robin, can you address that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher the amount of organic matter,
the more particulates there are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that the herbicides can bind to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why frequently you will see
on labels restrictions that if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: muck soils, you can't use certain
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because you either have
to increase the rate significantly or in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get above the level that's being
bound up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, the higher the organic matter,
the more the herbicides, particularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: this pertains to soil applied residual
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more you have, the higher,
the more that will be bound up,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay, and then... Question about...
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question about Queen Anne's
Lace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, does anybody have any... I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what would do a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: on that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin's shaking his head too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither one of us has much background with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, it's a perennial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brent also is asking, he says,
I'm thinking of very low soil organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter situations where CINBAR injures
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, in fact, there is a really low
organic matter, could you adjust the rate
[SPEAKER_03]: of CINBAR appropriately for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking very sandy soils,
most labels divide up their rates on the
[SPEAKER_01]: basis of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will have a sandy soil,
a medium soil, and a muck soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a high organic matter soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those rates are usually adjusted to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you can see those other
questions, there's a question about
[SPEAKER_03]: post-emergence control of chickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My answer on that is potentially stinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think I did talk to a grower
this year that had very good luck with
[SPEAKER_03]: stinger on chickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to suggest that's probably one
of the better ones at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's soil pH affecting
herbicide activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that, soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvin, do you have any ideas on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the pH of the mixed water would,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to answer it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin is suggesting that the pH might
have an impact on microbial breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it might indirectly have an
effect on the herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really got them going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am contemplating planting strawberries
on Lampson sand mixed with Poms muck
[SPEAKER_03]: ground that I have grown sweet corn on for
several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would Princep and Atrazine herbicide
residues affect this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing corn and you've used
Atrazine and Princep before, a real good
[SPEAKER_00]: way to see whether it would be a problem
would be to do a bioassay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for strawberries, bean seeds are a
pretty good indicator if it's a cucumber
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get your soil and you plant your
cucumber, your bean seeds in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get some soil that you know
you haven't treated that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the same soil type and plant the same bean
or cucumber seeds in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bring it into your kitchen and
put it in the windowsill and let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see differences between the
two, that might indicate that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: residue in the soil that might affect your
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if both grow the same and everything
looks normal, you don't see yellowing and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth, then it's probably safe to
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Atrazine can carry over as can
Princep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be a little bit careful
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario has a question about using Prowl and
Dual Magnum for the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current registration effort for Dual
Magnum is not full.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's focused on the year of planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I don't see us having a problem
with trying to get that changed for the
[SPEAKER_01]: registration when we actually get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both Prowl and Dual Magnum have good
potential in the first year in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: safety on the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you would select them more on the
basis of which weeds you knew had in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field because they do behave somewhat
differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Thomas Prouty has a comment that
soil pH will affect Triazine herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Thomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Kristen Callow asks if these
presentations will be available on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell website.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, they will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the link to that was on the first
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I've included that link as
well on all of the login information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, I will try to do that for
further webinars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move into the final phase of this,
which does allow you to look at some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the other information as far as things
that you can download.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's information about cultivation
tools, a handout that you can download
[SPEAKER_03]: onto your own computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a publication from Atra
on organic strawberry production,
[SPEAKER_03]: which might be of interest to some folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there are web URLs for some of these
other resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instances, the N-rays, excuse me,
production of vegetables, strawberries,
[SPEAKER_03]: and cut flowers using plastic culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cultivation tools source website
that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that URL is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some comprehensive
information about berry production.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the berry website that I also had
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is your site that you would go to
to get the archived webinars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to remind everybody that next
Wednesday, this coming Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_03]: November 4th, is our first weed management
webinar for blueberries and cranberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have speakers, Hilary Sandler of
the University of Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is going to, she's going to be
talking about weed control and
[SPEAKER_03]: cranberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Eric Hansen of Michigan State
University is going to be speaking more on
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we look forward to having those of you
who grow those crops to join us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I introduce the last pod,
I want to thank Dr. Marvin Pritz and Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robin Bellender for speaking to us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great topic and covered a lot of
territory, so I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to open this last pod,
but if anybody has any other questions
[SPEAKER_03]: before we sign off, I'd like you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go ahead and type them in the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have one more poll for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could just, if people could
just weigh in on this, there's a few
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have signed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if most of you could just vote quickly
and give us some feedback about what was
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful to you, that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is your chance, so please don't
hesitate to give us, type in a question if
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got it right in that chat box.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear from you.
All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, we've had about 10 more people that
might want to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're having people finish up,
we have a question from Lynette who's
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for control for horse metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if Marvin or Robin,
if you'd like to chime in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not really sure of, we were
talking about the horse metal issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really sure of a label product
that works well on horse metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a lot of those, like the wild
carrot and horse metal, you really got to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean them up before you plant
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you plant, it's really,
you're really limited in what you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in turn, someone commented they
can grow strawberries in between blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: beds for the first four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned that earlier than on
crops with more space in between them,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly things like blueberries,
you can't intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would say you have to be
careful with there is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries prefer a higher pH than
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have to pay close attention
to making sure that the pH isn't too low
[SPEAKER_00]: for those strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And horse tail, equicetum, none of us know
what you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Roundup doesn't take that out before
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you have horse tail,
you might just not want to plant that
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to build to a low-growing
crop like strawberries and look someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because save that field for corn or
something that grows taller, you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to get the horse tail out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of anything that works well
on that that wouldn't harm the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Richard Farris typing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question, a couple more things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't voted on our final poll,
please give us some feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you also, if you would like to send
me a note or give me a call, email me
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have specific comments that you'd
rather not type into the chat bar,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're a third of the way through these
webinar series.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would be really thrilled to hear
from attendees if they have some
[SPEAKER_03]: suggestions for ways we can approve even
other topics that in the future you'd like
[SPEAKER_03]: to see covered in a webinar type of format
or things that you absolutely hate about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to hear them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't hesitate to give us feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last question someone asked about a
home garden suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the things we talked
about early on in the presentation were
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were referring to herbicides for
organic growers, vinegar is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled pretty soon as that's going to be
labeled on a lot of different crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: has burned down action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine strawberries would be on
that label where you can use it between
[SPEAKER_00]: the rows, particularly to burn down annual
weeds that start to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a safe organic product for use on
strawberries and a lot of other crops.
All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, I'm going to close our poll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Chautauqua County is still typing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell us about different
formulations for 2,4-D?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there such a thing as imen and
formulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 2,4-D comes with different
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're referring to 2,4-D amine,
A-M-I-N-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a salt product, the 2,4-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not nearly as volatile as some of
the other 2,4-D products.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it doesn't vaporize and
move as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the type that's recommended for
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, it can still
volatilize and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't want to put it on
strawberries if you were near grapes
[SPEAKER_00]: because even using 2,4-D amine salt,
you can smell it shortly after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers have had problems that have
had grapes nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, out in the Midwest, they've had a
real hard time getting their grape
[SPEAKER_00]: industry started because they use so much
2,4-D on wheat fields and even some corn
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cheap herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really caused problems with the
wine industry out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do use it on strawberries,
it's one of the few broadleaf herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't affect strawberries,
which are a broadleaf plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful if you have grapes or
asparagus growing around your strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Marvin and Robin, very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to let folks know that once
you're on the registration list for the
[SPEAKER_03]: webinars, you will continue to get
connection information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for you folks who are just strawberry
growers, you could just delete my emails
[SPEAKER_03]: when they come if you're not interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are interested in maybe finding
out a little bit about these other berry
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, we'd love for you to log on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again for everybody attending.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the end of this webinar.
Thank you very much.
