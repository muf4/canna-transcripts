[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be talking about transcriptome
analysis in Petunia under cell stress
[SPEAKER_01]: today, which is a big part of my PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start off this talk by
introducing the problem with cell stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking briefly about a particular
mechanism that plants use to cope with
[SPEAKER_01]: salinity, introducing you a great new
model to study cell stress, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: Petunia, briefly talk about genomics in
different species, and then briefly
[SPEAKER_01]: mention about advantages of using RNA-seq
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to walk you through the
experimental design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to spend most of the time
talking about the result, which I broke
[SPEAKER_01]: down into RNA-seq without reference genome
and expanding results with a reference
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cell stress, it is a big problem
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no surprise about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in this map all these red
color that are pretty widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the world represent five grams
of sodium chloride per liter, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: equivalent to 90 millimolar sodium
chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty big amount of salt,
pretty widespread in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see that 20% of the irrigation
water is affected by solid stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is this a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, salinity and drought stress are the
primary causes of crop loss worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sodium chloride, actually,
it is what disrupts the normal plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a simple experiment in which plant
treated with sodium chlorides can show
[SPEAKER_01]: this really retarded phenotype compared to
the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a really long list of
detrimental consequences of sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just mentioning a couple here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big disrupt in mineral
nutrition, specifically with potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a more, in a cytosolic
level, strong inhibition in enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk about sodium chloride at a
cellular level, I basically mean when in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cytosol you find more than 100
millimolar sodium chloride as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: less than 10 millimolar in the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily for us, plants have developed
different mechanisms to cope with solid
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, again, a really long list of
coping mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just showing you here five,
which is restriction of salt uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: extrusion, and compartmentalization,
controlling the long distance of sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilizing membranes, and increasing
osmotic potential, just as a long list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so I brought this up because it's an
interesting cycle that uses one or more of
[SPEAKER_01]: these coping mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sodium chloride in high concentrations
can be perceived by unknown receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which trigger the elevation of cytosolic
calcium, a secondary messenger,
[SPEAKER_01]: that activates this protein receptor,
SOs3, which activates this kinase,
[SPEAKER_01]: SOs2, which is pretty much the kinase that
does a lot of the work in this mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: by phosphorylating these transporters here
in the plasma membrane, which actually
[SPEAKER_01]: extrude calcium pump sodium out of the
cytosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kinase, SOs2, as well, can control
the expression of NAX, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: tonoplast transported the pump sodium into
the vacuole, which will correspond to
[SPEAKER_01]: compartmentalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways in which sodium gets in
the cytosol in the first place is by
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing low affinity potassium
transporter that you guys can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a big unknown, and there's a
lot of research going on to figure out how
[SPEAKER_01]: this complex, SOs2, SOs3, can downregulate
and stop this low affinity potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's a lot of unknowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how this complex interacts
with the high affinity potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, of course, pathway has been
figured out in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the study that we know today in
solid stress has come from Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a great model for a lot of
things, but not really for solid stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are actually suggesting that we
should shift a little bit the pattern with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Arabidopsis to Petunia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do we say this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Petunia, under solid stress,
it really deals pretty well with solid
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% of sodium ions by dry weight,
it can accumulate 1% of its weight in
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we did this experiment in 2011 where
we screened the ability of 14 species to
[SPEAKER_01]: withstand sodium chloride, and we grouped
them in four big groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most tolerant species, somewhat
tolerant, sensitive, and extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that Petunia actually
ranked in the most tolerant upper level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you grow Petunias under 60,
40, 20 millimolar sodium chloride,
[SPEAKER_01]: really the growth and the phenotype is not
really affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see some detrimental consequences at
80 millimolar, not really affected in
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, but just retarding the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that Petunia can be a really
good model to further study the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Petunia is one of the members of the
Solanaceae family, which is a pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: many of these Solanaceae species are gray
for genetics and biochemical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the parents of Petunia hybrida,
axillaris, and inflata.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to talk about this later
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the distance-related
tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we think about Petunia as a
model species, the first thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually think about is that it is a
really good model for transposons,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost as good model as maize for
transposon elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cytogenetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a great model for pigmentation and
fluorescent and for pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're pushing now Petunia as a model
as well for solid stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what has been done in terms of solid
stress in this family?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately, there hasn't been a
lot of research conducted with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Solanaceae family.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most thorough study that was published
in 2007 was a microarray in tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they screened two accession of
tomato, this one up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stressed the plant with 150
millimolar sodium chloride and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: sample routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the microarrays, they were able to
identify roughly 100 ESTs that were
[SPEAKER_01]: differentially expressed at 30 minutes of
sodium chloride exposure, 700 ESTs at two
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, and 1,000 ESTs at six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to group all these ESTs
into different groups using genontology,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as energy, metabolism, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this was a great approach,
because it really changed the way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: approach the study of sodium chloride
looking single gene, single pathway,
[SPEAKER_01]: to a more global, holistic point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing something similar,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is that we're not
using these chips anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually using an RNA-seq approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that we decided to do it
this way is because microarrays were great
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are relatively low
throughput.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really depend on sequencing of cDNA
and ESTs libraries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be expensive and not
quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a false positive through
cross hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a really small dynamic
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is to say, transcripts that are low
transcript, transcripts that are
[SPEAKER_01]: transcribably low and really high,
they're not going to be picked by the
[SPEAKER_01]: microarray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, we decided to use a more novel
technique, RNA-seq, which is a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: throughput approach, where you can
sequence millions of nucleotides of DNA in
[SPEAKER_01]: a single run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is cheaper compared to a microarray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a really good dynamic range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more sensitivity than the
microarray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a better coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the flow as to how we actually
do the library preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to go over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a protocol developed by James
Gimignoni, the BTI, which I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so what are the goals of this project?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to characterize a
transcriptional profile of Petunia hybrida
[SPEAKER_01]: under cell stress, 150 millimolar,
and control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to develop a transcriptional
profile through a time course of gene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we aim, as well, to understand how
biological processes change it with cell
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the specific goals, which I'm going to
get later today, we wanted to compare
[SPEAKER_01]: using RNA-seq platform how gene expression
changes with and without reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did we set up the experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 18 plants growing hydroponically in
a growth chamber, which were randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: divided into two groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nine plants corresponding to
control, which I color-coded with dark
[SPEAKER_01]: green, and nine plants corresponding to
the treated plants with 150 millimolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you do RNA-seq, and when you do
basically any type of science,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is really good to do bioreps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pulled one leaf from three plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll become one bioreplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have rep one, rep two, rep three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will do this at this time point,
0, 6, and 24 hours after cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will do it at both control and
treatment to control for circadian genes
[SPEAKER_01]: or genes that are mechanically induced
that we're not really interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this for roots, for leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, as it is, it is a pretty big
experiment, a lot of RNA to extract from
[SPEAKER_01]: different tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to focus on leaves to begin
with, and we left roots for later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did all the leaves at the beginning,
and at these three time points,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6, 0, and 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said at the beginning,
we used this protocol developed by BTI by
[SPEAKER_01]: Giovanni's group, where we extract 12 RNA
with the TRIZL method.
[SPEAKER_01]: We capture messenger RNA with magnetic
beads, which we reverse transcribe to
[SPEAKER_01]: cDNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at this stage of the cDNA stage,
we index the library with a barcode,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6-nucleotide barcode with HPLC primers,
which would give us an indexed library.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the way that the protocol
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an already optimized protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we were doing this, we realized
that ordering HPLC primers, it was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, well, what happens if we index
libraries with non-HPLC primers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, for example, we have
these two indexed libraries.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them with this set of primer,
one of these with this set of primer,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them coming from the same pool of
RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would be virtually the same except
for the code, the 6-nucleotide code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did this little side experiment
with all the leaves to optimize this
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol by assessing if HPLC versus
non-HPLC would have an effect in library
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did we bother to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because if they're actually the
same, we can treat these libraries as
[SPEAKER_01]: technical replicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if we prove that this
doesn't really affect the data,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a big advantage for future RNA-seq
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this for all the libraries,
all the leaf libraries from these three
[SPEAKER_01]: time points, generating 30 libraries
corresponding to both technical and
[SPEAKER_01]: biological replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pair and sequence in a single lane to
rule out any lane primer effect in a high
[SPEAKER_01]: seq 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we generated 196 million reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we go about to do RNA-seq with
all these 196 million reads that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: generated with the Illumina high seq?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question that we asked was,
regarding to the HPLC and non-HPLC
[SPEAKER_01]: primers, was, OK, are those samples the
same?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were not, then we would just
discard non-HPLC samples, and we would
[SPEAKER_01]: proceed the RNA-seq without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in our case, and I'll show you that
it actually doesn't really matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we proceed to demultiplex, and we
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get rid of the Illumina adapters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We increase the Q value of the reads,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we work with these basically
clean reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the second question that we had to
ask is, well, do we have a reference
[SPEAKER_01]: genome that we can align all the short
reads against?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a reference genome,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can proceed to map and then look
for gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have, you need to assemble,
generate a consensus, and then you go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you map, you generate a bound file,
and then you can count basically reads,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the basics of RNA-seq and gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to get to this part later
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to this first question,
are these samples the same or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns out that it doesn't really
matter whether you use HPLC or non-HPLC
[SPEAKER_01]: primers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a heat map of differentially
expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In which we're looking at how the samples
cluster together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're basically comparing the
biological replicates, R1, R2,
[SPEAKER_01]: R3, versus the technical replicates,
NH and HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that all the distance between
the technical replicates, HP and NH,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is smaller than the biological reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to zoom into this heat
map to show you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this says R2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the technical replicates,
HP, NH, NH, HP, are more closely related
[SPEAKER_01]: than the biological replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see these across all the samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a great indication that really
it doesn't really matter whether you use
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC or non-HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the final and most strong evidence to
argue that you can use non-HPLC primer,
[SPEAKER_01]: it came from the statistical analysis
where we ran a multiple analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: variants between these two data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our statistical model, we include
primer type, HPLC, non-HPLC, time points,
[SPEAKER_01]: 0, 6, and 24, and interaction of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at the cutoff of the most
expressed transcript at 10,000 and 100,000
[SPEAKER_01]: RPKM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I'm just showing you the output
for the expression profile of the top 10
[SPEAKER_01]: most expressed transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that both treatment and
time points are significant, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the interaction of treatment and time
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But primer themselves, they actually are
not significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this data, we were able to
conclude that we can and we should treat
[SPEAKER_01]: our libraries, our non-HPLC and HPLC,
as technical replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the great impact by decreasing
the cost of library preparation for future
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA-seq experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that wasn't my research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little side project that we
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real research, it was to do RNA-seq
with petunia and their cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question then becomes,
how do we extract biological information
[SPEAKER_01]: from these reads?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first problem that I had is that
there's already 60 plant genomes sequenced
[SPEAKER_01]: and available.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just some of them, Arabidopsis
di rara, Thaliana, of course, models.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have maize over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of solanaceous,
tomato and potato, but there's no petunia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the era of next generation of
sequencing, you have to have a reference
[SPEAKER_01]: to align your reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you go about if you don't have a
reference?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns out that there is a way to do
this, which is by generating a
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptome by de novo assembling all
the millions of reads that you generated
[SPEAKER_01]: with Illumina sequencing into one final
transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, of course, a very simplified
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will basically treat this
transcriptome as if it was a genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a genome, but we will use it in
the same way to map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we do this step?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different types of assemblers
nowadays that can allow you to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three assembler, Myra,
GS assembler, and IA assembler,
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically rely on overlapping DNA
sequences and looking for consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are actually more suited when you
have long reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my experiment, I had short reads of
DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we would look at these four
assemblers down here, trans-Avis,
[SPEAKER_01]: SOAP, Belvedet, and Trinity, which they
don't really rely on these overlapping
[SPEAKER_01]: consensus sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rely on really complex mathematical
algorithm based on the Brugene graph to
[SPEAKER_01]: generate a transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we did this is that we chose
the three of the newest assemblers
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity, SOAP, and trans-Avis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we generated three independent
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would evaluate which of these
transcriptomes would be the best and use
[SPEAKER_01]: that transcriptome for downstream
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're looking at the comparison of
the messenger RNA length distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different assemblers we use compared
with tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't plot transcripts longer than
5,000 base pairs, because otherwise this
[SPEAKER_01]: box plot would have been huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here we have the tomato
transcriptome, which we know the median
[SPEAKER_01]: size is roughly 1,000 base pairs for all
the transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when using Trinity with default K-mer
25, we obtained a really close
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution to tomato, which was closer
than any of these other three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now SOAP with K-mer 47, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the second best getting close to
tomato, but it wasn't as good as Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And SOAP with the default, it wasn't
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trans-Avis was the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really recover most of the
transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allowed us to see that Trinity
was the best de novo assembler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we also looked at bioinformatics
parameters to make sure that Trinity was
[SPEAKER_01]: indeed the best assembler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at contig mean size of
all the assemblers, Trinity was by far the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contigs were almost twice as big as
any others of the assemblers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a pretty big L50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a really low N50, which is
basically an indication as to how
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction, how cut off the transcription
can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lower the N50, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only really bizarre thing that we
observed was that we identified over
[SPEAKER_01]: 100,000 unigens with this de novo
assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this stage, we don't know how
many genes Petunia has.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that tomato has roughly
35,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Petunia, there's no way that Petunia
has more than twice as that, unless there
[SPEAKER_01]: are crazy duplication gene events,
which are really unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to get to that in a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we went ahead and we annotated
this transcriptome that we developed using
[SPEAKER_01]: BLAST2GO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And BLAST2GO actually uses the NCBI
database to do all the BLAST.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the annotation wasn't really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spent a lot of time trying to figure
out why the annotation wasn't really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized that, well,
the tomato genome is actually not on NCBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing the BLAST against all the
other species except tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we re-annotated the same
transcriptome against the SGN database.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a database exclusively for
Solanaceous that is run on BTI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I re-annotated using a BLASTx against
the SGN database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the annotation was actually way
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to annotate roughly 33,000
unigens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these 32,000 map directly to the
coding region of tomato with an average
[SPEAKER_01]: size of roughly 1 kb.
[SPEAKER_01]: We identify ribosomal proteins,
a few bacterial genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the large majority of the genes were
unannotated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that they correspond to variable
5 prime and 3 prime UTI regions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: unique to Petunia that are normally
conserved with tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you might recall from the
beginning, Petunia is a great model for
[SPEAKER_01]: transposons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that we're actually capturing
a lot of that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we need to keep in mind as well that
we have this big number of unigens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because multiple unigens can
correspond to one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a simple example in which we
have a gene with four exons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And assuming that this gene doesn't have
any isoform, this is the only isoform,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will see that the same correlation of
the exons in the transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we map, we see enough coverage of
reads that align to exon 1 and 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do not see enough coverage from
exon 2 to exon 3, and the same from exon 3
[SPEAKER_01]: and exon 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the software, which is
pretty smart, but it's not smart enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is thinking that these are actually
three independent genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also explains why we get big
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this big number, it's been reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people that have done our de novo
assembly in other species, in Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: college, for example, find a similar
number of unigens, which was surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we decided to use genontology
to assign function to all these de novo
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly transcripts that we were able to
annotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the unigens
distribution, 50% of those are related
[SPEAKER_01]: with both metabolic and cellular
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 20% of the overall distribution
correspond to response to stimulus and
[SPEAKER_01]: biological regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we uploaded this transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: This transcript can be a great tool for
bioinformatics purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to share this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We uploaded as a FTP file in the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Genomic Database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a few weeks that we published
this work, we actually got a lot of emails
[SPEAKER_01]: from people asking if we could make this
blastable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever favorite gene that we're
working with, they could blast it again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we contacted people at the SGN and
requested if they could do a blastable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go now to the SGN, do a
transcription project.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can type whatever partial sequence
that you have for your favorite gene and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if you can retrieve more of the gene
itself or the annotation for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that wasn't the whole purpose
of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The project was to do RNA-seq to study
cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we needed to go through this de novo
assembly to have all the players to do
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have a reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can map using this software's bow
tie to look for gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do this, you generate a BAM file.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using RSEM, you can count,
normalize, and look for reads per kilobase
[SPEAKER_01]: of exon of read maps, which is a measure,
basically, of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using this package in this
bioconductor, DSEQ, you can look for
[SPEAKER_01]: differential express genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between these two things, the RPKM and
the DEX, you spend a lot of time doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: data mining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why do we need to data mine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what you get from using RSEM
bioconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a pretty complex matrix of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this is, for example,
corresponds to leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were treated with salt under 24
hours, you see all the RPKM values.
[SPEAKER_01]: RSEM is bound with trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can identify genes and different
eye forms of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, this is not really intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make absolutely no sense of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what you data mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what type of data mine method do you
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that really depends on the type of
research you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our case, making sense of these
100,000 genogenes, we decided to do look
[SPEAKER_01]: for anomaly detection, perform a gene
ontology analysis, cluster analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and compare, basically, our data with our
transcriptome analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to talk briefly about these
three today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at anomaly detection,
you have to remember that all these
[SPEAKER_01]: sequences were coming from leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We left the roots at the minus 80 at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do leaves, you basically
would expect that rubisco is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: abundant enzyme in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would expect that the expression of
rubisco is the highest in both
[SPEAKER_01]: salt-treated and controlled leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: We observed that the top 10 most expressed
genes in terms of RPKM were all related
[SPEAKER_01]: with the photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, rubisco was the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this data, of course, is not really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sort of to validate the RNA-seq
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't do anything with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it let us know that we're on the right
track with the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the gene ontology analysis,
we just aim to better understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: biological processes are affected with
soil stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I said before, we use gene
ontology to assign function to this
[SPEAKER_01]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real question that we were looking
for was, how do these biological processes
[SPEAKER_01]: change it with sodium chloride?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we perform a statistical analysis
Fisher test of gene ontology term
[SPEAKER_01]: differences, where we would look for the
dex of two time points, control 6,
[SPEAKER_01]: salt 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will compare those against our
universe, which is the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are different ways to talk
about and represent gene ontology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the world cloud is one of the
most simple ones to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep in mind that all of these are
overrepresented goal terms that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant FDR that I'm not showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at these two time points,
control 6 and salt 6, we see that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: abscisic acid and ethylene are one of the
most overrepresented goal terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also find kinases in G protein couple
receptors as the most overrepresented goal
[SPEAKER_01]: terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this, actually, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that ABA and ethylene are
distressed hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should, of course, see an
overrepresentation of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that kinase and GPCRs are crucial
for signaling transduction pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually seeing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding salicylic acid, it was really
interesting because this has been reported
[SPEAKER_01]: with more plant pathogen interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an interesting crosstalk
between the biotic and abiotic type of
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the most interesting part of the goal
term analysis, it wasn't this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that we found 72 unique goal terms
associated exclusively with 24 hours after
[SPEAKER_01]: cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these 72 unique goal terms were not
found at control 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we think about it, it actually
makes sense because at this stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: cells have been exposed to 24 hours of
sodium chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're actually seeing a little
cellular damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cells are trying to cope with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: One way is that they produce lipid
biothynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see that there's a lot of
glycerol transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also observe from this goal
analysis that cellular biological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, such as DNA replication,
DNA binding, are highly affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to bring these slides from
the very beginning to show that even in
[SPEAKER_01]: this really short list of consequences,
we were able with this analysis to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify how membrane stabilization and
osmotic potential are represented here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this analysis was really useful for us
to better understand the biology of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, of course, is a really brief
summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I want to talk about
with this first part is the cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a heat map using with the
RSEN package again, where we look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: differential expressed transcript isoforms
across the different time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in green, you see upregulated genes
and right downregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the interesting things about
the heat maps is that, or clustering for
[SPEAKER_01]: that matter, is that it allows you to
identify patterns of biological interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So RSEN actually gives us 12 clusters
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how they are related with
this side with dendrogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the heat map, you see that this is
a cell 6, cell 24, and the three control,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, of course, it makes sense that the
cell cluster more closely than the
[SPEAKER_01]: controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at these clusters,
there were four clusters that were highly
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two subclusters, 7 and 12, were at the
very bottom, where you can see that under
[SPEAKER_01]: cell, there's a lot of green colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under control, red color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the largest cluster,
two, and a small cluster up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you actually see red colors under
the cell and green colors under the
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this can be confusing, but the
interesting thing about clustering is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can now go and zoom into these clusters
and look at the profile of these genes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at this subcluster of
interest, by looking at subcluster 12 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 7, the one that were at the very bottom of
the heat map, we see that each one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these gray lines correspond to a single
transcript, and the blue one corresponds
[SPEAKER_01]: to a consensus of the cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that under the control,
the expression of all these genes is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when cell hits the expression in
subcluster 7 and 12, it goes dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we identified that these three
irregular transcripts were chaperones that
[SPEAKER_01]: were induced over 90 folds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this was the largest subcluster,
which wasn't really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does show an increase in their
expression upon cell stress, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly as dramatic as these two clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, this was interesting that we
only find in this whole live experiment 49
[SPEAKER_01]: transcripts that were highly expressed
under the control, but upon cell
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, their expression would down
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for our purposes of narrowing down to
candidate genes, we looked at this
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster, which was the most interesting
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had 88 transcripts that had a
really interesting pattern that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in following.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were interesting transcription
factors like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, some of these genes had
already been described in literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we decided to select a few
candidate genes, of course, we narrowed it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to those ones that were not
previously described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led us, this discrimination of
this gene led us to narrow it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically eight candidate genes,
eight novel candidate genes that have
[SPEAKER_01]: never been described in literature for
cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grouped these candidate genes into
two groups, basically those that were
[SPEAKER_01]: induced at both time points, cell 6 and 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cell 24, they were induced by several
faults, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of the candidate genes,
they were induced only at 24 hours after
[SPEAKER_01]: cell stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the profiles of these
candidate genes, I just want to draw your
[SPEAKER_01]: attention right away to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the expression of this gene is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is virtually zero under the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at six hours of cell stress,
it is induced by 17 faults.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 24 hours of cell stress,
it is induced by almost 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes this gene a really
interesting candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it makes it also really
interesting is not that it has a high
[SPEAKER_01]: expression and induction, but also is
unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that this gene maps directly to
chromosome 3 in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were not able to retrieve any
information about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's not a chaperone because
we weren't able to retrieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following up this gene would be really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these other genes are also highly
expressed and induced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not nearly as dramatic as this unknown
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, so the last four candidate
genes that we selected, they were only
[SPEAKER_01]: highly induced and highly expressed at 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these genes, there are cell-sensitive
genes that are late in the induction
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lastly, I want to say that doing
RNA-seq is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows us to identify cluster genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand a little bit of the biology of
high stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to make these candidate genes
official, quote unquote, you need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the characterization of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is that we ordered a few of
these mutants, one of the eight candidate
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by we genotype, trying to find the
homozygous that has the tDNA insertion in
[SPEAKER_01]: both alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able, this is only one mutant,
we were able to identify roughly like five
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of homozygous line for this
genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, following up with this part of the
research, it really takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna suggest that the next PhD
student in Neil's lab maybe have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting task to follow up this gene,
especially the unknown one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unknown one, it can definitely lead
you to a plant cell type of publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also would like to see that the next
PhD student follow up with this reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic approaches, screening the mutants,
doing VIX.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, Petunia is a great model for
VIX.
[SPEAKER_01]: Complementation in planta, overexpression
with 35S and inducible promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like a more broad type of
research would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at only one cultivar,
Mitchell diploid, but it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to see if other Petunia
hybridas perform in the same way than
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to finish up this section,
I like to say that pretty much everything
[SPEAKER_01]: what I just mentioned, it was published in
PLOS-1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paper came out a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a big collaboration between,
of course, Neil, myself, people in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, Orellano, who is actually now a
faculty member at Virginia Tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Scanlon and James Giovanoni.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I'd like to acknowledge two of my
colleagues, Margaret Frank, who is now a
[SPEAKER_01]: postdoc in the Downford Center,
and Brian Emmett, who contributed with
[SPEAKER_01]: really thoughtful comments, especially
Brian, with a lot of statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between all of them, we were able to
publish this, and we were really excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing that I want to talk
about is how can we expand basically these
[SPEAKER_01]: results now with the reference genome and
including root samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the specific goal for this was to
compare using this platform, Illumina,
[SPEAKER_01]: with our reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I show you this experimental design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said at the beginning that we focus
firstly on leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're including everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have the sequence for leaves,
so we just needed to include roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only different thing that we use
now is that we use the Tuxedo package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this package, basically you map all
the rates using TopHat that runs Bowtie2
[SPEAKER_01]: in the background to align all the rates
to the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you use CAF links to look for all
the aligned rates, make them into
[SPEAKER_01]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with CAF diff, you can look at
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, why did I bother to do
all the de novo assembly in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place if you have reference genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Neil said at the beginning,
we didn't really have a reference genome
[SPEAKER_01]: when we first started, but it wasn't until
late September that we started to
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborate with the Petunia Genome
Consortium, which allow us to use one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reference genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very briefly, the Petunia Genome
Consortium, it is a really big effort
[SPEAKER_01]: between scientists in both the US and
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, probably the most important
people are in BTI, Lucas and Ore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people in Switzerland,
Chris Cullemeier, people in Italy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Tom Gerrard in the Netherlands,
as well as Francesca.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was great because it really
allowed us to use the genome as a
[SPEAKER_01]: reference and that expand a whole lot the
way that we can do RNA sequencing,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we specifically doing with the
Petunia Genome Project?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say much because it hasn't
been published yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I'm looking at
is I'm looking at molecular markers,
[SPEAKER_01]: single nucleotide polymorphism,
SNPs, to assess how many transcripts are
[SPEAKER_01]: inherited from each parent to a hybridome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Tuxedo analysis, what we used,
it was this genome, the Petunia axillary
[SPEAKER_01]: genome, because both the functional and
structural annotation of the genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was actually in better shape than in
FLATA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually see that here we have
roughly 36,000 genes, which is much less
[SPEAKER_01]: than the 100,000 that I find in the de
novo assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But using this genome as a bioinformatics
resource, it was of great help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we run the analysis using Tuxedo
and the reference genome, we found
[SPEAKER_01]: actually 34,000 genes, which is much,
much more accurate than the 100,000 unit
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that we find with the de novo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found 37,000 isoforms with Tuxedo and
135,000 with de novo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, there's no question that
running Tuxedo, it is a much more accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do RNA sequencing, we identify roughly
11,000 differential expressed genes
[SPEAKER_01]: between root and leaf over a million
promoters and over a million splicing
[SPEAKER_01]: sites when we look at the Tuxedo output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the things that is really
interesting with Tuxedo is that you take
[SPEAKER_01]: everything into R, and into R,
you really can do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do anything you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to do the analogy with the cell
cycle, because doing RNA sequencing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is really like the cell cycle where you
have a lot of checkpoints and if the
[SPEAKER_01]: checkpoint has not been satisfied,
the cell cycle stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the RNA-seq, it's really the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first checkpoint for us
where we see, how do the sample cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, in this dendrogram,
we see that we have two big branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: one corresponding to root and one
corresponding to leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes sense, because roots should
be more closely related to each other than
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't see this sort of pattern,
there is something that went wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to stop and go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I had to do this twice,
because one of the scripts that I wrote,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look now between this branch,
you see that the control cluster more
[SPEAKER_01]: closely together than the cell treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a really good sign that you're
on the right track.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at all the biological
replicates and the technical replicates
[SPEAKER_01]: here, you see that they also cluster
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see all the leaf cell 24 cluster here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, again, is a good indication
that you're doing things well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at differentially expressed
genes, now with Tuxedo, we actually can
[SPEAKER_01]: further look into leaves and roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this Tuxedo package, we were able
to identify 6,700 differentially expressed
[SPEAKER_01]: genes, some of them that were exclusively
expressed in this early time point,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them were exclusively expressed in
this later time point, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these decks are expressed between
both time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the de novo assembly,
we were able to identify 7,000
[SPEAKER_01]: differentially expressed genes,
which wasn't that far off from what we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually found here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we did the same thing with the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are specific genes induced at this
time point and at the other time point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I said, this is still ongoing
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have all the data that I'd like to
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I'm currently
working on is see, well, how many genes
[SPEAKER_01]: are differentially expressed that are
between leaf and roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, so I still need to do gene
ontology analysis for Tuxedo, do the
[SPEAKER_01]: clustering using these two softwares,
and talk about candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't have all the candidate genes,
but we do have this one that it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: really amazing profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can actually see that the
expression, it remains pretty flat,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually zero in leafs and even in roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only at root cell 6, it is expressed
over 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: FBKM induced 24-fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at root 24, it is induced by almost
80-fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the expression of this candidate gene
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ortholog in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to still look at the function of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, I just want to wrap up
with some conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually developed a really novel
transcriptome of pituitary hybrida under
[SPEAKER_01]: cell stress, where we identify over 1,000
different abregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through clustering analysis,
we were able to narrow it down to eight
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, using Tuxedo package,
it's really a much more accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: bioinformatic tool that gives you a better
representation of gene expression and
[SPEAKER_01]: differential expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still working on finishing up with
this Tuxedo package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to do the ontology and the
clustering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the things that I really
want to do is compare how do the candidate
[SPEAKER_01]: genes from the denoble compare to the
Tuxedo analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lastly, I'd like to acknowledge Mike
Scanlon from Plant Biology, Marine Hanson,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Debbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Debbie from MDG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, all the collaboration with James
Giovannoni.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orellana was the bioinformatician that
helped us a lot with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also taught me a lot of bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really grateful to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucas Miller, we run all the software for
free, basically, in a huge server at the
[SPEAKER_01]: BTI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the Cornell sequencing facility,
they did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I want to very specially thank
Dr. Neil Matson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as he said, I came in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nelia was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the stegonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank Neil for all his
patient, all his mentoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been a great advisor, someone really
great to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm basically mostly grateful,
because he really led me wander off pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: far away from his owner of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was willing to collaborate and learn
with me, which is something that sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty members don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think his really kind approach to do
that enabled us to build a stronger
[SPEAKER_01]: network connection in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dylan wasn't even in the map at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only weird thing about Neil,
I have to say, is that he likes to think
[SPEAKER_01]: in really strange places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first came, I thought maybe it
was an American thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I realized that no, it was Neil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he always, even in these
places, he wanted to talk about research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always was procrastinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I also want to thank my
girlfriend, Amanda, for all her support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, our dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the last slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank the Horticulture
Department very much for these great six
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also SOHO for supporting six years as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the biology, different bio TAs
that I've done over the last four years
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Professor Trojan is here,
who runs this bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any question, I'm happy to
answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that you said 2% of your unit genes map
to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's because the tunas were
infected with certain diseases or lab
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do those bacteria genes come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some little percent of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find any human genes suggesting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which map do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very beginning of your talk,
you could have a slide showing the general
[SPEAKER_03]: response mechanisms for salt stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our SOS1 and sodium proton antiporter,
those two genes are among the upregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: SOS1 and sodium proton antiporter.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, SOS1 is a sodium proton antiporter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both are upregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find them in your research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer for that is that tunas is a
model that you really withstand salt
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that after 24 hours,
you start seeing damage, but you don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: the upregulation of these genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to see the sample extrusion
mechanism here, you have to expose plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to 48, 96 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you will see these types of
responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is it going to take to provide
information to plant breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it will take a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I said, the functional
characterization of the gene is equally as
[SPEAKER_01]: important as the RIC part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just identify a novel type of genes
that may or may not be suitable for use as
[SPEAKER_01]: marker for breeding, or to use for gene
imaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
