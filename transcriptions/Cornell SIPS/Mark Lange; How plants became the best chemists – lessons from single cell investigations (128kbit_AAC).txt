[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thank you for the
invitation, and I'll talk to you about
[SPEAKER_00]: secretory structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone may have heard about those,
but I hope to convince you that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually important, and diversity is
really a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an opportunity, but it's also a
curse, so sometimes we're spread too
[SPEAKER_00]: thinly, and you will probably recognize
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just seize these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I want to put out a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not entirely proven and tested,
but I think it's an interesting one to
[SPEAKER_00]: start for a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical diversity of metabolite
correlates with the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, when you look at plants,
they make hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: different metabolites across the different
species in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans can't do that, and one of the
reasons is because plants, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: have evolved these secretory structures
where they can use them as a playground
[SPEAKER_00]: for testing out new biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make something new, it's not
immediately detrimental to growth because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can sequester it, and that's a key
aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the hypothesis that I'll go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other possibility, obviously,
is to volatilize metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get rid of them by moving them
into the atmosphere, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something we'll focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at the evolution of land
plants in various different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at extant plants and try to
make inferences as to what things may have
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at biomarker metabolites that
are indicative of certain metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at structures that exist on
plants today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you notice that
there are various different structures
[SPEAKER_00]: that have evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important one was the evolution of oil
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the non-vascular plants,
you have hornworts, you have mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very rich in chemistry,
but the liverworts are incredibly rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have oil bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are intracellular organelles that
hold lipophilic metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least from the correlative
evidence, that might be one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why they can generate this diversity of
structures, because they can sequester
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what people have also, boy,
this is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: What people have also shown is that there
are ambers that people have recovered from
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 300 million that have been dated
back to more than 300 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are fossilized remains of what
very likely were resin ducts or resin
[SPEAKER_00]: blisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still find them in the extant conifers
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's an important storage
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will find glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these were the earliest ones were
found at a similar time dated back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition of the conifers to the Permian
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was seed ferns that had these
glandular trichomes with hooks on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if an insect would walk over the
surface, it would catch this hook and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would then release volatiles very likely
that were stored in those glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're very common in the
angiosperms, which evolved much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were also, it looks like present
in some of the plants that were present on
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth much earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will find these various different
themes when it comes to these secretory
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to make a pitch very briefly
about studying these metabolites that
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate in these specialized
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that this is not what people
would generally consider as metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these buzzwords that people
like to use these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are lots of considerations
that have to go into your experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to go over this very,
very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at volatiles,
in some cases you can collect them from
[SPEAKER_00]: the head space, but you have to be
equipped to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's become very popular is tissue
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a few pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that looks like and what you can
learn from those kinds of technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you analyze, you can pre-process
your samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only interested in a subset of
metabolites, you can absorb them to
[SPEAKER_00]: certain types of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has volatiles, you can do solid
phase extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fairly common method for
pre-treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in most cases you want to separate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have thousands of different
metabolites in an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they all go into your detector at
the same time, you might overwhelm that
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chromatographic separation is
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use stationary phases,
as they're called, or different columns
[SPEAKER_00]: that have different polarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, you retain the analytes
differentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That separates them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we do a lot because we work
with volatiles that are used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fragrance and flavor industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of chiral separations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus limonene smells like turpentine
almost, plus limonene smells like citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are able to differentiate
enantiomerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to focus on those
chiral separations to ensure that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: which of the isomers you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for larger scale separations,
we do the typical large columns that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have different ways in which you
can detect metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass spectrometry is certainly one
important one these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diet array also gives you information that
allows you to infer to structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flame ionization detection is something
that you do with GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very nice for routine screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It essentially just burns carbon,
gives you a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's non-selective, which is an
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can characterize your analytes by
fragmenting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain rules in chemistry
that allow you to infer structure from
[SPEAKER_00]: these fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same with nuclear magnetic
resonance, which is even more informative
[SPEAKER_00]: toward structural characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you still run into that major
problem of peak annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have lots of spectral features that
are reported by your instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to use databases to
match those with known spectra or a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectra of known metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you develop technologies like Gorot and
Hisnabdu, where you're trying to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with rules that will allow you to use
theoretical databases essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the take-home message here is I review
a lot of papers and people oftentimes just
[SPEAKER_00]: believe what the instrument tells them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you certainly can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because your top library is X,
Y, and Z doesn't really mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes you really have to dig deeper
and do a better job with the annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's also important is that
you're not just using one technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to look at things from various
different angles, separate metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: using various different techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also ideally use different
techniques for detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little pitch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about these specialized cell
types or secretory structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll begin with Chinese medicinal plants
that we've worked with, the Thunder God
[SPEAKER_00]: vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great name, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's used in traditional medicine and
medicines throughout Southeast Asia since
[SPEAKER_00]: the 15th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the roots that people
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously that's non-sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you kill the root, you kill the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to regrow these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be at a certain age before
you can harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw those roots before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are plants that are six,
seven, eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fairly slow cycle in which you
grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug candidate that has been pushed
the furthest is called tryptolite,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a diterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a structure in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been clinical trials that
have been reasonably successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a sourcing problem because
you're extracting from these roots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields are extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because the dry weight
content of those diterpenes is 0.008% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine you're going through
enormous amounts of tissue before you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is some preclinical data for
some of the triterpenes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll briefly mention some of the work
that we've done on those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's important is that the
traditional methods that people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: using are great for preliminary data,
but it's very difficult to do this at a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat similar to the situation
with taxol, which some of you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is now produced in
plant cell cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Justin Fischetic was a postdoc who now
works in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost all the students and postdocs
that come out of my lab these days because
[SPEAKER_00]: those states that have legalized cannabis
now require the measurement of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while everyone has focused on the
cannabinoids, no one knows how to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for me to get students to
actually finish, which is good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't answer that, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, on the left side here,
that is tryptolite, very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: functionalized diterpene, synastrol here
is a triterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both accumulate in the roots to the
highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tryptolite you also find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, this is a logarithmic
scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gray are the synastrol
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very, very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the different root types
that you see here, much higher than what
[SPEAKER_00]: the diterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the boss sometimes goes into the
lab and actually does stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly when it's things that no one
else likes, like running larger columns
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolating metabolites and those kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did this three years ago,
I think, over Christmas break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I isolated some of those peaks and Niana
Shvidya, or Shri as we call her,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is a senior scientist in the group,
did most of the downstream analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she ran them all the mass spec,
she got NMR spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we developed a database for NMR
spectra that has been very, very useful
[SPEAKER_00]: for us in deep replicating extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can very quickly identify which of
the peaks that we find in a chromatogram
[SPEAKER_00]: and then where we have spectra have
actually been reported before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, I hope you can see
that, I hope that there are a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: these sesquiterpene alkaloids of fairly
complex structure where in some cases they
[SPEAKER_00]: only differ by positions of certain
functional groups or you have functional
[SPEAKER_00]: groups in different locations and that is
very, very difficult to resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with fairly crude extracts using
this NMR database, we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify or associate a tentative
annotations that wiggled it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a structural class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to get full spectral annotation,
you would have to do two-dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments and those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next thing that we wanna try
to integrate two-dimensional spectra into
[SPEAKER_00]: the database and find a way to generate an
algorithm that will capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, the point here is that these
databases allow us to go through extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: much faster than before and focus on the
metabolites of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll talk about now are the
dieterpene, so the dimethyl celestial and
[SPEAKER_00]: the celestial that I showed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did root imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's a malady-based
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a cryo-sectioned sample,
you have a laser that goes over that
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample can be moved in a certain
pattern and essentially eventually you
[SPEAKER_00]: will have covered the entire surface of
that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end then is a mass
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially at every given time when
you've collected a sample and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what pattern you used to go across that
sample, you get a mass spectrum on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then analyze those mass spectra
and in this particular case, it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument that also allows you to do
separations in the gas phase called ion
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the molecules are separated by shape
because you can't do chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very important here because a lot
of these are isobars, they have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: mass, but the shape is different so you
can distinguish them using ion mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, you have these
triterpenes all on the outside where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex is, whereas some of these
sesquiterpene alkaloids, they are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex, my bad, and the triterpenes are
all in the periderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing in this case is that these
triterpenes of interest, they're quinone
[SPEAKER_00]: methides, so they have a color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have chromophores in there so we can
actually see them and we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate what we see with mass
spectrometry with what we actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nice thing here is, as the
technology improves, you can get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: almost cellular resolution with these
technologies and that is, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that in the future is going to
make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and this is the drawback,
it's not very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the diterpenes, for example,
we couldn't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrations of those were too low
to be picked up using this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were somewhere in the fairly high
background noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you have to do is you
have to coat these samples with something
[SPEAKER_00]: that facilitates the ionization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in an ion source, you have a lot
of energy to break up molecules or ionize
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Maldi, you don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need that matrix to help you with
transferring energy from the laser all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the matrix gives you a lot of
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's certainly one disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to, well, let's stay with those
triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another cross section in this
case of a fixed route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this orangish color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because they've been fixed and you
use solvents to do that, the triterpenoids
[SPEAKER_00]: don't stay exactly in the location where
they were before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we were asking is,
is it maybe incorporation into membranes?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are sterols in membranes,
like beta-cytosterol would be a common
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question would be, is there more of
these triterpenes found in the layer where
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually find the accumulation based on
the mass spec results compared to other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the route?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the outer route parts,
if you just release, if you just section
[SPEAKER_00]: this out, had a bit more beta-cytosterol,
which is a typical membrane sterol,
[SPEAKER_00]: than the inner parts of the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to keep in mind that large
parts of the inner route are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no functional membranes and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference is really not that
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for the triterpenoids,
the difference is enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: From high milligrams per gram quantities
in the periderm, essentially nothing in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt that the membrane was
apparently not the best candidate as a
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that got us thinking, and we did a
number of different stains for different
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall polymers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is suberin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the localization,
then the only one that appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate with the localization of the
triterpenoids is suberin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a polymer, and there are,
in some cases, people have actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reported triterpenoids to be incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are soluble, so we can just use
an organic solvent and they'll come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not polymerized into the
polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just somewhere out there,
you know, in that general cell wall area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know exactly where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least the imaging gave us some good
ideas of where to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us back to what do we do
with those diterpenes that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed a different system to work on
where the concentrations that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: work with would be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michael Hartman, who's now at the
University of Dusseldorf, was a postdoc in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amber Parish.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still a technician in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed a root culture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are adventitious root cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, you can grow them in fairly
large flasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow to kilos weight balls of roots
within a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very nice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the profile here,
so those are the roots and metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much about the various
different metabolites there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tryptolite is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tryptolite and other diterpenes are
secreted into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to extract from the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just being placed where you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You replace the media anyways,
so every two weeks you would take the
[SPEAKER_00]: media, extract them, and those root
cultures would keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concentrations in there would
actually be fairly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that allowed us to just look at the
profile of diterpenes in those root
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was using that same approach
where we're combining the analysis by mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometry, MSS, MS spectra,
and NMR to get IDs on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the structures,
you can place them into a theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we could come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the universal precursor for most
of the diterpenes, geranyl, geranyl
[SPEAKER_00]: diphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make an intermediate, eventually
the hydro-abionic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, you're functionalized,
so you have to lose this as CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to functionalize this position
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give you an additional
hydroxylation here, would give you
[SPEAKER_00]: tryptanin B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not detect tryptanin B in our cell
cultures, but we detected something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called tryptanin A, so it's
methylated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a methyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cyclize here that methyl ester,
but you can also cyclize at this stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and both of those metabolites we found in
our extracts, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, you can just look at the
metabolites that you're getting out of an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract like this, and you can come up
with a hypothesis of what the power
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic pathway looks like, and then you
can start trying to work this out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which one of the PhD students,
Fima Inabwi, did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she looked at the diterpene synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-step conversion here to a
precursor, a different precursor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have various different
terpene synthases that take it to those
[SPEAKER_00]: different structural types, and what was
rewarding in this case is that the end
[SPEAKER_00]: products generated by those terpene
synthases have the structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: structural cores that people have reported
to occur in the genus tryptorhidium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kaolin diterpenes that are not
directly related to gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same core structure,
but they're actually natural products and
[SPEAKER_00]: not hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have more hormone functions,
and so those had been characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: before, and we essentially identified the
first genes and encoded enzymes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: path to those natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AB18 diterpenes, those are the
precursors of tryptolide and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: diterpenes in tryptorhidium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was significant progress there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now a number of other groups
that are working on this, so because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a lot of funding for it,
we're currently not taking this any
[SPEAKER_00]: further, so that allows me to transition
to a different project.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different type of secretory structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll be talking about glandular
trichomes, and one of the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've worked with for many years is
peppermint and other mints, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: question was, so we had made significant
progress in working out the pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to the essential oils that you're all
familiar with, but what was not known is
[SPEAKER_00]: how they power metabolism, because the
glandular trichomes in there are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these structures?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are epidermal outgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see them with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis you can, but in most plants
you can't, and they usually have a series
[SPEAKER_00]: of cells that are highly active
biosynthetically for the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific specialized metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually some kind of storage
cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that this is actually pre-formed,
and then essentially that space in between
[SPEAKER_00]: just fills up, and some of the metabolites
that you will find in different glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome types would be menthol and other
mono-terpenes, and peppermint,
[SPEAKER_00]: artemisinin would be a nice example,
and sweet wormwood used as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-malarial, salvin RNA is the only
psychoactive terpene known so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm sure you're all familiar with,
just on paper of course, and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: important questions for us was where does
this complex oil composition in peppermint
[SPEAKER_00]: come from, and that involved trying to
find out what the different contributions
[SPEAKER_00]: from potential ancestral species were to
the very complex hexaploid genome of
[SPEAKER_00]: mentholpiperida or peppermint,
and it turns out that two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents, if you will, were mentha
suaviolans, or apple mint, and mentha
[SPEAKER_00]: longifolia, or horse mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are diploid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are particularly prominent in the
Mediterranean, and very likely that's
[SPEAKER_00]: their origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My current hypothesis is that it was the
Romans that brought a experiment-like
[SPEAKER_00]: plant over to Britain, where eventually
mentha huperida emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppermint was first found in a place
called Mitchin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively close to present-day
London, and very likely humans did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a hand in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a chance discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone went into a field, said,
oh, this smells nice, and because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile, because of that very,
very complex genome composition,
[SPEAKER_00]: four copies from mentha aquatica,
which is water mint, very common in
[SPEAKER_00]: England, then one copy from mentha
suaviolans, and one copy from mentha
[SPEAKER_00]: longifolia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine what that does during
meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sterile, and that's why everyone's
been growing just vegetatively propagated
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also no breeding with the most
widely grown spearmint, which is native
[SPEAKER_00]: spearmint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't do a whole lot with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we wanted to know is how you
power metabolism in the cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make those essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably go back briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the contribution from the water mint is
primarily a molecule called mentha ferran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from the mentha spicata comes,
it has a different hydroxylation path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different pattern from peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the position C6, and all the
C6-related metabolites tend to accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: in spearmint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a different position that is
functionalized in peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the C3 position, and you can see that
all the products that accumulate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil from this pathway are functionalized
in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of differentiates the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know how you power
metabolism in there, Sean Johnson,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's now a postdoc with Bjorn Hamburger
at MSU, was very interested in building
[SPEAKER_00]: genome scale models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, what you do is you
summarize all the information you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: on a species of interest, and you put this
on top of something that's already known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first genome scale models,
as you might imagine, were developed for
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contained a few thousand metabolic
reactions, and they were all linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key there is that the only parameter
that's really important there is mass
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one is the
stoichiometry of all the reactions has to
[SPEAKER_00]: add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only constraints there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no kinetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only information you need is which
enzymes use which substrate, make which
[SPEAKER_00]: product, and what are the cofactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this across hundreds or
thousands of reactions has to add up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of curation that has to
go into building these models and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you extract information about those
reactions from various different
[SPEAKER_00]: databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use as much information as you can
that is already existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balancing the equations is essentially
what I just told you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need subcellular localization,
because if you have different isozymes
[SPEAKER_00]: doing different things in different
compartments, you want to capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then means that metabolites have to
be able to move between compartments,
[SPEAKER_00]: so all of this has to be accounted for,
otherwise your model dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we also wanted to do is
associate reactions with transcripts,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily to figure out which of the
reactions in this very large network are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have pathways where you need 10
reactions and the genes for all those 10
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are not present, well,
very likely that pathway is not used in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cell type, which is the definition of
a specialized cell type.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do a whole lot of things,
so you want to know what do they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we integrated,
and there are some algorithms that also
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to integrate those for flux
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to be careful, because
transcription doesn't really translate
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to enzyme activity, so you have
to use algorithms that are based on
[SPEAKER_00]: weighted measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the impact of a change in transcription
level will not be as high as it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: if you didn't weight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still more like a presence-absence
call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you expand your network by the
reactions that are known to occur in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant of interest or your cell type of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you essentially do a few other things
that you don't have to worry about too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it breaks it down into a system that's
a bit more simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have leaves of peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the secretory cells within those
glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disk of eight cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you import a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are non-photosynthetics,
so they can't just take CO2 from the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go through a network of reactions,
and you make monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure a lot of the metabolites
that are required to make monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure all the monoturpenes and
sesame turpenes and also the flavonoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that accumulate in the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us a system where we can now
predict what is the most likely path
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the different possible
reactions toward these end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things that Sean did
was in silico knockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question that you're asking in that
case is, what's essential?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I knock out a reaction, does that
network find some way around and still
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine in central carbon
metallon, there's usually some way around
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get into the end product
pathways, there's none, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially all the genes that are
directly involved in making monoturpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and secreting those is lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you modeled this as a silico knockout,
obviously you need to exchange all the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen,
otherwise you can't make anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to import sucrose or some other
oligosaccharide as a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also need to worry about
energy equivalence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to worry about the electrons
for reduction reactions because in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case it was ferredoxin NADP reductase or
FNR that was returned as an essential
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme for producing monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might not think as that of being
directly related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we looked into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the bioenergetic constraints
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this shows is essentially relative
expression levels based on RNA-seq data
[SPEAKER_00]: for isolated glandular trichome cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see all the constituents of
oxidative phosphorylation and its
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the TCA cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we asked, well, how does this
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much CO2 are you producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the quantity of monoturpenes
produced from sucrose as a carbon source?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's radio-labeled
sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested various different concentrations
and then we used oligomycin, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor of the ATP synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the presence of oligomycin,
you should not be able to generate ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore if this is the process by which
you're making ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at very low sucrose
concentrations, you just don't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that makes sense because if you
don't have carbon, you can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go a little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one millimolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are experiments with isomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are isolated secretory cells,
I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're making less monoturpenes,
but you're still making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to higher sucrose
concentrations, there's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be some other process
that also provides energy for these cells
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not related to what I'm showing
you on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one possibility, it's not very common
to talk about fermentation in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they actually do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polymptums, when they grow, rely on
fermentation because they grow pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells have to make turpenes very,
very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In peppermint, the oil-filling process of
an individual trichome takes only 25 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an almost visible quantity of oil
produced by eight cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 24, 25 to 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enormous flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you're coupling the
recycling of NAD and ADH to the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of ATP at the bottom end of glycolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're generating ethanol in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes do this all the time and they do
it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the modeling can help you a
little bit because you can ask if I allow
[SPEAKER_00]: certain imports and if I allow certain
exports, would you predict any role for
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation if I allowed these reactions
to be present?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can model without, you can model
with, you can have various iterations of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least our initial calculations
indicated if you could do fermentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would actually get a fairly high
carbon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would benefit the entire system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean did a number of stainings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stain for alcohol dehydrogenase,
which is one of the key enzymes to make
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that some of the glandular
trichomes start to stain very darkly in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not all of them stain because the ones
that you would stain are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actively secreting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a developmental program that
leaves go through and not all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichomes are active at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on where you are on the
plant and at what stage you are if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually actively secreting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the isolated secretory cells,
you can see that there's different levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of activity, but there's certainly
activity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then also looked at trichomes that were
isolated from young leaves where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher proportion of glands in secretory
phase with those of mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the labeling went from more than 10%
of all the glands being labeled to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADH activity was very high and young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glandular trichomes was essentially
lacking in mature ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two isoforms that were detectable
in our transcriptome data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expressed them, purified them,
characterized them, and they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: typical KM values of alcohol
dehydrogenase, which are actually pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Vmax values that are also fairly
consistent with what's in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be an alcohol
dehydrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might actually be going that path,
but how does that relate to the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the KM for the substrate of the
alcohol dehydrogenase is very high,
[SPEAKER_00]: it means you need pretty high
concentrations before this becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable source of recycling NAD and ADH and
producing ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's consistent with you need a
whole lot of sucrose to get enough flux
[SPEAKER_00]: into fermentation before it actually makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we estimate that the sucrose
concentration, unfortunately, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: measure sucrose in those cells because as
you isolate them, they empty out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: small molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to refeed from a carbon
source, which is an advantage in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, but you can't determine how much is
in those cells unless you had a sensor or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would give you in vivo
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least as a model, it makes sense
that fermentation would support the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of those monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these very complex schemes with
lots of stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the pathway from precursors all
the way to lots of various different
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the same pathway that I
showed you with structures before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here it's the genes and enzymes that
have been added.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to focus a little bit on
those redox active enzymes, which I've
[SPEAKER_00]: blown up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you about the ferredoxin NADP
reductase or FNR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in non-photosynthetic cells,
the transfer of electrons works opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: in the opposite direction as in
photosynthetic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been established in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The redox potential of the enzymes are
different in that you're actually starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're transferring a hydride,
which translates essentially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer of an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going from NADPH to FNR to
re-reducing ferredoxin, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: active enzyme that interacts with those
reductive enzymes in the pathway toward
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the precursor pathway that
provides the precursors for monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually do need this enzyme in
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had never really thought about it that
much, but the modeling essentially pointed
[SPEAKER_00]: us toward the FNR as a potentially
important player in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way you can use these
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Sean then did is he looked at all
the different isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I hope you can see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the isoforms of FNR that
occur in glandular trichomes and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all cluster together across
various different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the photosynthetic ones,
which are different, different redox
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, different sequence,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they kind of cluster together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surprise was here that when we looked
at the ferredoxins, so the substrate for
[SPEAKER_00]: the ferredoxin reductase, you still have
the photosynthetic ones that cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have a minor, very lowly expressed
isoforms in glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this with glandular trichomes
from various different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cluster with the root isoforms
that have been characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a separate one, which is the
major isoform in all non-photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mint family, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cluster separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears that there might have been
an event that led to the evolution of a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate clade of ferredoxin enzymes that
is present in glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that all fit together?
[SPEAKER_00]: The major and minor isoform, if you cut
off the placidial targeting sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at what we believe is the mature
protein, there's 12 differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence at the amino acid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have 12 possibilities of affecting
the interaction of the biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme, the electron transferring enzyme,
and the source of electrons, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: FNR that you need to re-reduce the
ferredoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think it's a difference in redox
potential, because that wouldn't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe it's actually a difference in
the interaction between the proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to do a little bit of
modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, you need to test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that Nate Boyer is
now beginning to do, a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you see the pairwise interactions
between, in this case, the FNR and
[SPEAKER_00]: ferredoxin, and there are two residues at
the interface where electrons are being
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred that could be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the interaction between the
ferredoxin again and the HDR, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic enzyme involved in monoturbin
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a total of six residues that are
in locations where you could, where an
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction might occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes, if you can measure,
the heats that would be differential
[SPEAKER_00]: during the interaction of those different
enzymes, then you can determine if the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-protein interactions have an
effect on total flux through that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we're trying to
do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you need super clean proteins
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to absolute homogeneity,
and then you can use isothermal
[SPEAKER_00]: calorimetry and other methods to really
study the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we're trying to
do, but we're not yet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we asked, well, is this something
that is transferable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we transfer what we've learned with
Mint to other glandular trichome-bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because quite a few of them, including
tomato that a number of people here are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, are photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does what we've learned about Mint
apply So we did genome scale modeling for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the species where glandular
trichome-specific transcriptomes were
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this case, we only used Illumina
datasets because it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of these algorithms to work if
you take data from various different
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why tomato is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that's been released on
glandular trichomes is old enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still ESTs and not Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't find datasets to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't include tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other species that you'll see
are interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the grant scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some that can do photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can generate, reducing equivalent
NATP through photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can couple this to the incorporation
of CO2, like you do in photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You generate various different end
products from various different
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediates, depending on the type of
trichome you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they will be specialized,
for example, to accumulate terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain types of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes small amounts of flavonoids
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be others that make large
amounts of flavonoids, but maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some that accumulate acyl
sugars, but maybe not too many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitter acids would be in hops and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't have all of these
reactions present in all of the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can capture the diversity in
metabolic pathways using these metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were asking is, first,
if you just look at gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, do they match what we would
expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the abundance of transcripts somehow
correlate with the abundance of end
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for salpy glosses, which accumulates
acyl sugars, but primarily flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid biosynthesis genes are highly
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some acyl sugars, but it's not a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Solanum, Kituense, accumulates more
acyl sugars, less flavonoids, but still
[SPEAKER_00]: decent quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that's reflected in the
genes that are known to be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a salvia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes primarily di-terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the pathways that are involved in
di-terpene biosynthesis are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for a salvia divinorum, which makes a
different set of di-terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mentha heparida is very rich in
monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's reflected in the gene
expression patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitter acid biosynthesis in hops is just
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lupulin glands, there's almost nothing
else in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have alkaloids in Campotica,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sesquiterpene lacotone in something called
xanthium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Arabidopsis that doesn't make
anything in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't find those transcripts as
being enriched at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing that was interesting,
if you look at the size of these bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there are two species here that are
known to be non-photosynthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the glands are non-photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hops and peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in both cases, the relative number of
transcripts devoted to making these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular end products is the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the degree of specialization appears to
be even higher in those that are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might just reflect the fact that if
you're partially photosynthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can at least use other pathways to
supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have to be even more specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for the complexity of this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is modeling various different
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different levels of photosynthesis,
photosynthesis unrestricted, and sucrose
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake unrestricted, both unrestricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is reduced sucrose uptake,
but still photosynthesis at full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50, no photosynthesis, I believe,
and high sucrose uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the four different scenarios
that we modeled for all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to pick one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's very difficult to see all
the different colors, but what's
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighted here is with the blue squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are reactions that we would usually
associate with heterotrophic metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breakdown through glycolysis and so
on toward a certain end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see whenever you have sucrose
present, in high amounts, if you allow
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose to be used, that's what they will
do primarily, even if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually experimental evidence
from Alain Tissier's lab in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked with tomato, and he actually
showed by feeding experiments that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the photosynthetic trichomes of
tomato prefer an imported carbon source to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their own photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although they're photosynthetic,
they're only partially photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you reduce the amount of sucrose
available, then they will resort to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis if they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't, then everything breaks
down, and they don't make anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you learn at least a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll race through the rest very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're pretty much out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the important questions is
obviously, OK, we're beginning to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how these specialized cell types work,
what they do, how they function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we extrapolate this so that we can
make predictions at a macroscopic level?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first did this with peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Rigoberto Rios, who's now a
professor in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He counted glandular trichomes on leaves
at any given stage after a leaf emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the numbers are pretty
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be a special kind of person
to do this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these grids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to associate the
various different enzymes with different
[SPEAKER_00]: development stages and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, the models that we've
built can now be used to go from a single
[SPEAKER_00]: cell type to the entire leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do the same for the entire
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done something similar for resin
ducts in loblolly pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just summarizes work that took many,
many years to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still unpublished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, this is a cross-section
through a needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see resin ducts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a smaller one emerging here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can determine the volumes of these
resin ducts by microscopic measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can extrapolate to 3D structures
using various different assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, we can also measure
the oleoresins that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you project how much resin should
be there based on just microscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and then extrapolation,
which is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To those that I actually measured,
we've done this for three entire trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually fairly close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you understand what is happening at
the single cell level, you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, if you're willing to put in
a lot of time and you have very patient
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you can extrapolate to entire
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last example, where this is Sausie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Sausie Buonadrigo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She became a Buddhist nun after she
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if it's for everyone to
work on these kinds of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked with Citrus Peel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her model system was grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they have different shapes
at different developmental stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to capture this mathematically
when you're going through all your
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of microscopic images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have developmental patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have fruit size versus volume per
cavity and the distribution of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity sizes over fruit development and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make predictions of how much
oil should be accumulated in the peel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the dotted line is what we
predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solid line is what we measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was over two growth seasons for
entire fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually works reasonably well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go from single cell types again
to entire fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I think I've mentioned people
who are involved in my lab, in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that might be interested,
you can look at our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a service center that might
be of interest to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of collaborative work
with Ruben Peter's lab on the Tryptoregium
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others were not as collaborative in
this particular case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding came over the years from lots of
different sources for the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for individual people from the
NIH, O'Bride, and the Human Frontiers
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's the last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for staying with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the question is, do those cells
then produce ATP less efficiently when
[SPEAKER_00]: they use fermentation than what they would
do if it was through oxidative
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is it's very difficult to
quantify those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at enzyme activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not measured ethanol production,
which would be what you would have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can label, but trying to quantify
these exactly when you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: these isolated cells is not trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're measuring CO2,
you always have to take into account that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a process where you're trying to
capture this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the monoterpenes or other
volatiles will be captured as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to measure CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've not found a technical approach
that we found was quantitative enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: really answer the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to know how much
contribution you have from the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, they must be doing either one or
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are not mutually exclusive,
but quantifying this has been a real
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you would think they do this
when, for some reason, oxidative
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation is not at its peak,
or they can't use that in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: they would usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would almost seem like it's a
supplemental thing they would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the carbon source is high, which
changes the kinetics, and it just makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't know if everyone could hear
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question about secretion and
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been something that's bugged us
for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did EST sequencing, which is what
you did before some of you were born,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you would look at the abundance of
these ESTs, and you would notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be things like lipid transfer
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In peppermint, it was the most abundant
transcript in glandular trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a percent of all the transcripts
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some structure functional modeling
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lipid transfer proteins are
supposed to transport lipids from one
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can fit, if you look at the,
it's solution state structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: NMR structures, that they have for the
lipid transfer proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit one fatty acid chain in there,
and then the rest just has to kind of sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and it moves them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For terpenes, they have a different
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much smaller, but they're a little
bulkier, and we could not come up with any
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism that would give you any
specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you try really hard, you can fit a
monoterpene in there, but it never felt
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some transporters that people
have found, mostly through genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, but in some cases also
biochemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latalia Dudereva reported one recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some older works on roots
that secrete diterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have found ABC transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when you make mutants, then are
impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lipid transfer proteins in
tobacco that have been associated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but never had a structure function that
was shown to actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's evidence, genetic evidence,
that this could work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biochemical evidence is still somewhat
weak, and I'm still worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how these things would be
specific enough for the types of volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: blends that you're producing that would
then be secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that everyone wants to
figure out, but it's a tough challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
