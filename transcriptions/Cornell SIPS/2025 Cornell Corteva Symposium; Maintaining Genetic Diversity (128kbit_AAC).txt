[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, good morning, everyone, and thank you
more for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited to talk to you all today
about some of the work that my lab is
[SPEAKER_06]: doing and turning to tomatoes genetic pest
to improve traits for its future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get started, I just want to
thank the grad students for the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity to present here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really an honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was a grad student, these symposia
were a highlight of my graduate career.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first one that I attended in
2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: The theme that year was breeding for the
emerging global middle class.
[SPEAKER_06]: That year, I had the opportunity to
nominate and ultimately invite a scientist
[SPEAKER_06]: whose work I really deeply admire.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Frank Mangan at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst, who devoted his
[SPEAKER_06]: career to reaching out to immigrant
populations in the Northeast United
[SPEAKER_06]: States, developing market opportunities
for new vegetable crops for those
[SPEAKER_06]: communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned recently that Frank passed away
last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: This symposium gave me the chance to meet
him in person, hear a wonderful seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to be on the other side of that and
presenting today, it's really meaningful
[SPEAKER_06]: to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all for the opportunity,
and thank you, Portiva, for sponsoring
[SPEAKER_06]: these wonderful programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was also excited as a new tomato
breeder to hear the theme of this year's
[SPEAKER_06]: symposium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm biased because of what I work
on, but I think tomato is really a model
[SPEAKER_06]: for the conservation, characterization,
and utilization of wild relatives in plant
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the efforts of pioneering
geneticists like Charlie Rick,
[SPEAKER_06]: who collected thousands of accessions,
both wild and domesticated, of tomato,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have access to excellent germplasm
resources in gene banks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild relatives of tomato have been used to
answer fundamental questions about
[SPEAKER_06]: evolutionary biology, like the evolution
of self-incompatibility and interspecific
[SPEAKER_06]: incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And breeders have used these genetic
resources for, at this point, almost 100
[SPEAKER_06]: years to identify traits of agronomic
importance in wild relatives and bring
[SPEAKER_06]: them into domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to give a really high-level
outline of my talk today, I want to share
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit about the genetic history of
tomato before going into what the modern
[SPEAKER_06]: US tomato industry looks like and where
the research that my lab is doing,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we aim to fit in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk about two different
projects that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, looking at a very diverged tomato
wild relative and looking at sources of
[SPEAKER_06]: abiotic stress tolerance there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also going more recently into
tomato's evolutionary past, and breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: modern varieties for quality and beauty
using heirloom genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, I'll talk about some of
the challenges that we're facing and what
[SPEAKER_06]: I think possibilities are for the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're generally considered to be 16
species that are wild relatives of tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are found in western South America,
where populations of these grow from the
[SPEAKER_06]: western slopes of the Andes to the coast
Two of these species are also found
[SPEAKER_06]: exclusively on the Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_06]: These species occupy a variety of
different ecological niches and grow in a
[SPEAKER_06]: variety of different microclimates that
people have characterized extensively,
[SPEAKER_06]: considering what that could mean in terms
of their potential impact for tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the domestication of
tomato, for a long time, it's been
[SPEAKER_06]: recognized that the most closely related
wild relative is Solanum pipinellifolium,
[SPEAKER_06]: which you can see on the left here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This species produces small, maybe
pea-shaped fruit that ripen to a red
[SPEAKER_06]: color.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also been this other botanical
variety of tomato called Solanum
[SPEAKER_06]: lycopersicum variety, Saraciforme,
that grows either as a cultivated plant
[SPEAKER_06]: through South America, Central America,
Mexico, or it grows in wild populations or
[SPEAKER_06]: as like a weedy species in relation to
human habitats.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been proposed that this botanical
variety was kind of an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_06]: intermediate in the domestication of
tomato from Solanum pipinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the exact nature of where and how that
happened has been under debate for a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the most recent theories that's
come out proposes a pretty complicated
[SPEAKER_06]: story of how tomato was domesticated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the story that they present is most
parsimonious with the genetic data that we
[SPEAKER_06]: have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the authors of this paper propose
is that tens of thousands of years ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: before humans arrived to South America,
ancestral populations of Solanum
[SPEAKER_06]: pipinellifolium migrated to Mexico,
acquired different traits, adaptations to
[SPEAKER_06]: a new climate along the way, and diverged
into this new species, Solanum
[SPEAKER_06]: lycopersicum variety, Saraciforme.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then tens of thousands of years later,
it moved back to South America.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this time in a much shorter time span,
probably carried by humans who are also
[SPEAKER_06]: carrying other early domesticated crops,
such as maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in South America, it hybridized with
wild populations of Solanum
[SPEAKER_06]: pipinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_06]: The native people of South America might
have selected and domesticated Solanum
[SPEAKER_06]: lycopersicum Saraciforme at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It then moved back to Mexico, where the
native people of Mexico domesticated the
[SPEAKER_06]: large fruited tomato that we all recognize
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't really have records of what
early tomatoes selected in Mexico look
[SPEAKER_06]: like in terms of herbarium specimens or
images.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we do have is what was characterized
by the Europeans in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_06]: 1500s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shortly after the conquest of Mexico and
when tomato and other crops were moved
[SPEAKER_06]: back to Europe, and grown in botanical
gardens, and characterized by botanists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we can see is that there really
was quite a bit of morphological variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomatoes at this point were yellow,
they were red, they may have been purple,
[SPEAKER_06]: they were different shapes, they were
small, they were large.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like native Mexican farmers
probably selected and grew and preserved a
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity of varieties with different
morphologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shortly after that, the tomato began to
spread outside of botanical gardens and
[SPEAKER_06]: into local cuisines and cultures across
Europe, starting in Spain and Italy,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then moving to other countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as this new crop was integrated into
new cultures, we saw this radiation of
[SPEAKER_06]: morphological diversity and development of
novel use types.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Italy, you see the development of
types that some of you might be familiar
[SPEAKER_06]: with today, like the San Marzano paste
tomato, a type with high soluble solids
[SPEAKER_06]: for processing into sauces.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Spain, there was a development of these
storage tomatoes, these de penjar
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties that traditionally were hung and
stored for the winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's kind of interesting or
paradoxical is that despite all of this
[SPEAKER_06]: morphological variation, genetic data
shows that actually these vintage or
[SPEAKER_06]: traditional European land races of tomato
have a very narrow genetic basis,
[SPEAKER_06]: much more narrow than the wild populations
that preceded them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems hard to believe, but if you
are familiar with some of the effects of
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the mutations that are used in
tomato breeding, it kind of starts to make
[SPEAKER_06]: sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this figure on the right here shows
just the effects of four different genes
[SPEAKER_06]: with strong effects on tomato fruit shape
variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see how different combinations
of alleles at these four loci result in
[SPEAKER_06]: this wide variation of tomato shapes among
modern market classes of tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thinking about genetic diversity in
tomato's evolutionary history,
[SPEAKER_06]: it appears that there were multiple
incidences of genetic bottlenecks
[SPEAKER_06]: affecting the genetic diversity,
but also a few cases where as a result of
[SPEAKER_06]: admixture and crossing with wild
relatives, the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_06]: increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, as Pimpinella folium migrated to
Mexico, there was a reduction in genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then as those populations moved back
to South America crossed with the wild
[SPEAKER_06]: population of Pimpinella folium,
there was an increase in genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: After domestication in Mexico to the large
fruited domesticated type that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: familiar with, there was a further
reduction in genetic diversity that was
[SPEAKER_06]: made more extreme with the bottleneck as
those moved out of the Americas and into
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, if you look at the genetic
diversity in modern varieties today,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's actually been an increase in
genetic diversity in modern tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties, which kind of contradicts
something that a lot of us think when we
[SPEAKER_06]: think about the results of modern plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for that is because plant
breeders have intentionally introgressed
[SPEAKER_06]: alleles from wild species into modern
tomato varieties as sources of important
[SPEAKER_06]: agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here I'm showing the phylogeny of
tomato species that I showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those species that I've circled here have
been used to identify traits of interest,
[SPEAKER_06]: move them into tomatoes, and those traits
are used commercially today in tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just the most closely related
relative Pimpinella folium.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some that are quite diverged from
domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: The species that I put an asterisk next
to, there's reports in the literature
[SPEAKER_06]: about QTL or genes being mapped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And move to tomato, but I'm not sure if
they're used commercially or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sequencing data shows that these wild
introgressions actually contribute
[SPEAKER_06]: significantly to the genomes of modern
varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look at these images here,
the light blue represents haplotypes from
[SPEAKER_06]: modern tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these other colors show haplotypes,
introgress from wild species and the
[SPEAKER_06]: traits that they're associated with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in some cases, if you look at
chromosome one and you look at these
[SPEAKER_06]: processing tomato hybrids, here denoted
with P, you can see that there are small
[SPEAKER_06]: introgressions from selenium and
Habrikites that provide higher soluble
[SPEAKER_06]: solids content associated with the AGPL1
gene.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at chromosome six,
you can see among a variety of modern
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties, both fresh market and
processing, you'll see that over half of
[SPEAKER_06]: the chromosome seems to be represented by
these two different disease resistance
[SPEAKER_06]: introgressions from selenium chelense and
selenium peruvianum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's even more extreme on
chromosome nine, where essentially all of
[SPEAKER_06]: the fresh market hybrids that were
sequenced in the study have a very large
[SPEAKER_06]: introgression from selenium peruvianum
conferring resistance to tomato mosaic
[SPEAKER_06]: virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even more amazing to think about this
when you think about or see in seed
[SPEAKER_06]: catalogs, the extent of introgressions
that are present in modern tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a screenshot I took from the
Harris seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a tomato called Maverick,
bred by an alumnus of Cornell,
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason Cavatorda with Earthberg seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at what I highlighted in
terms of its disease resistance package,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can count one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10, 11, resistance to 12 different
diseases or disease races.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few of these might be represented by
different multiple genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of those are independent
introgressions from wild species that
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato breeders have.
[SPEAKER_06]: have used in breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before I go into the focus of my lab
and talk about a few examples of how we're
[SPEAKER_06]: using genetic diversity in tomato
breeding, I thought it might be useful to
[SPEAKER_06]: just give an overview of kind of what the
tomato industry looks like in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States and where the tomatoes that we eat
come from.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of acreage, the state with the
most significant acreage is California
[SPEAKER_06]: with almost 300,000 acres of tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is predominantly processing
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very highly specialized industry
with specialized varieties that are
[SPEAKER_06]: machine harvested.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are processed into ketchup and
tomato sauces and all other products that
[SPEAKER_06]: we eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state with the second highest report
amount of tomato acreage is Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are about 30,000 acres of tomato in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, Florida is where the
tomatoes that we were shipped across the
[SPEAKER_06]: country and consumed in the off season
when tomatoes couldn't be grown elsewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: were produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And historically, the way this happened
was these were varieties that were picked
[SPEAKER_06]: when they were what's called mature
greens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before they start turning red off the
plant, they were exposed to ethylene gas
[SPEAKER_06]: to promote ripening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this way they could maintain a very
high level of firmness and tolerate being
[SPEAKER_06]: shipped around the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that industry still continues today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increasingly, though, if you go to the
supermarket and look at tomatoes that are
[SPEAKER_06]: there and look at the sticker and see
where they came from, you might notice
[SPEAKER_06]: that a lot of them come from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are varieties coming from high
tech greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: These greenhouses, there's a large number
of them in Ontario, also many in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Northeast and Midwestern United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is another very highly
specialized production system where these
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses grow indeterminate or vine
ripening types.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're plants that are grown for 10 or
even more months.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the end of the season, these things are
dozens of feet long.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are producing high quality
tomato varieties that are sold off in
[SPEAKER_06]: retail, in supermarkets, in clamshells.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, the last major kind of production
zone I'll mention is Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: We import a lot of tomatoes from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlike Florida, these are typically
harvested vine ripe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of these varieties have a gene that
offers extended shelf life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have slow ripening, and they can
tolerate being shipped when they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see a lot of these in the
supermarket as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say those are the four major
production regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I didn't mention was New York and
the Northeastern United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's obviously where we are,
and that's where my work is based.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in New York, we have around 2,000 or
maybe a little bit more acres of tomatoes
[SPEAKER_06]: grown in the open field.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably similar acreage in
Pennsylvania and New England.
[SPEAKER_06]: So compared to, say, Florida or California
or Mexico or high tech greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_06]: the total value of that seed market is
more minor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of private sector investment
and breeding, there's fewer resources
[SPEAKER_06]: devoted to breeding for this region.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still a significant amount of
acreage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because farms on average in the
Northeast are smaller than many other
[SPEAKER_06]: parts of the country, collectively,
this is representing thousands of
[SPEAKER_06]: individual vegetable farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: For many of these people, tomato might be
a very significant crop in terms of their
[SPEAKER_06]: profit margins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's still many needs that need to
be addressed for this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are those needs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that I would say would define
tomato production where we are is we have
[SPEAKER_06]: a pretty short growing season,
May to September.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have warm, humid summers that result in
high fungal and bacterial disease
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those diseases that we have in the
Northeast are, in many cases, different
[SPEAKER_06]: than the diseases that are of importance
in the Southeast and in protected culture
[SPEAKER_06]: environments.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Northeast, we also have very high
proximity to major population centers,
[SPEAKER_06]: people with very high demand for good
quality produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that results in farms having a
diversity of marketing strategies,
[SPEAKER_06]: people selling wholesale and people
selling directly to consumers through
[SPEAKER_06]: things like farmers markets and
community-supported agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of my lab's research and
extension goals, to summarize it at a
[SPEAKER_06]: really high level, what we do is we try to
release cultivars and germplasm adapted to
[SPEAKER_06]: the Northeastern United States with high
yield, quality, and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: We discover the genetic basis of traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: In many cases, traits that are important
to the Northeast, but also to other
[SPEAKER_06]: production regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another goal we have is to model
strategies for the implementation of new
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies and applied vegetable
breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as part of our extension mission,
we try to generate and disseminate results
[SPEAKER_06]: on variety performance in New York for our
stakeholders, which are farmers,
[SPEAKER_06]: gardeners, and members of the seed
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm going to get into two different
projects that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leveraging genetic diversity from tomatoes
past at kind of different places in its
[SPEAKER_06]: evolutionary history.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the first project, we're accessing
diversity that diverged from tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is from the species of lamb
sidians, where we're looking at sources of
[SPEAKER_06]: abiotic stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then instead of millions of years ago,
we're also accessing diversity that
[SPEAKER_06]: diverged from modern tomato maybe more
like 100 years ago or 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this figure is definitely not to scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's quality that we're trying to
access from heirloom varieties for modern
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll talk a little bit first about
salanum sidians.
[SPEAKER_06]: Salanum sidians is a tomato wild relative
that grows in the Atacama Desert of
[SPEAKER_06]: northern Chile.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Atacama Desert is the most arid
non-polar desert on Earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: On average, it receives about half an inch
of rainfall a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some weather stations in the Atacama
Desert have never recorded any
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation as long as they've been
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's remarkable is if you look at
these pretty desolate landscapes,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are these wild tomatoes that are
able to grow there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like a pretty remarkable
source of tolerance to these very harsh
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the phylogeny that I showed
earlier, you'll notice that I didn't have
[SPEAKER_06]: a circle around salanum sidians.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because for a long time,
breeders weren't able to access genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity in salanum sidians because of
reproductive barriers with lycopersicum.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't cross lycopersicum and salanum
sidians.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Roger Chatelet at the University
of California Davis, over the course of
[SPEAKER_06]: many years, decades, actually,
completed a very complex series of crosses
[SPEAKER_06]: using bridge species in order to move
genetic material from sidians into
[SPEAKER_06]: lycopersicum and develop a population of
introgression lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are 56 lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each of them have a single introgression
from salanum sidians in the background of
[SPEAKER_06]: domesticated fresh market tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: These introgressions range in size.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on average, they're about 20
megabases, which most of them probably
[SPEAKER_06]: have several hundred genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this population was developed and
released recently for use by the tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding community.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were very interested in this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I first started, and we still are,
there are multiple traits that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in looking at.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is salindi stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a few different reasons why.
[SPEAKER_06]: So salindi stress can depress tomato yield
in a few different environments of
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial relevance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the Central Valley of California,
where, like I said earlier, there's almost
[SPEAKER_06]: 300,000 acres of tomato, there are
actually millions of acres of cropland
[SPEAKER_06]: there that are affected by pretty high
groundwater salindi.
[SPEAKER_06]: This red area shows areas where the
salindi is so high that there's a yield
[SPEAKER_06]: impact on tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: In New York, we're a much wetter climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soil salinization is not really so much of
an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, in certain kind of
production systems, it can be a problem
[SPEAKER_06]: for farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in recent years, in the past maybe 10,
20 years, the production of tomatoes in
[SPEAKER_06]: high tunnels has really kind of exploded
in New York and many other states.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens when you put some sort of
covering over your plants and preclude
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation from falling on the soil is
you prevent leaching of salts that build
[SPEAKER_06]: up through application of fertilizer and
your irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this production system actually results
in creating something more similar to like
[SPEAKER_06]: an arid climate as in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: This can be managed through cultural
practices, but still in recent years,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've seen many farmers struggling with
high levels of soluble salts in their high
[SPEAKER_06]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there have been populations of salami
sedians found growing in basically like
[SPEAKER_06]: salt basins, soils with an electric
conductivity of almost 100 decisiemens per
[SPEAKER_06]: meter, which is around 40 times the level
that tomato can tolerate.
[SPEAKER_06]: The particular accession that was used as
the parent of the introgression line
[SPEAKER_06]: population, however, hasn't been
characterized for its salinity tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing that we wanted to do
was verify that it's tolerant to salt and
[SPEAKER_06]: also develop some methods or protocols for
evaluating salinity tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this work has been led by our lab's
field and greenhouse manager, Howard Rice,
[SPEAKER_06]: who has been very creative in designing
the irrigation systems that I'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: showing and leading these experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the literature, there's many different
ways that salinity is evaluated in tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes, people evaluate it in terms of
its impact on vegetative biomass at the
[SPEAKER_06]: seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really wanted to look at fruit yield,
the most directly relevant agronomic
[SPEAKER_06]: trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way that we did that was we grew
plants with drip irrigation and then with
[SPEAKER_06]: these fertilizer injectors, instead of
injecting just fertilizer into those
[SPEAKER_06]: irrigation systems, we injected table salt
as well at different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grew the plants to maturity and
evaluated their yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gonna pull my phone out to get a
quick time check.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this first experiment, we looked at
four different genotypes of tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two parents of this introgression
population is Fresh Market Line LA4354,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Citian's donor here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also, as a susceptible check,
we looked at a processing tomato hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a resistant check, we looked at an
accession of Solana pinellia that's been
[SPEAKER_06]: characterized by others for salinity
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of that work has been at the seedling
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this experiment, we grew the plants
under four different treatments,
[SPEAKER_06]: a fertilizer-only treatment, and then
three different levels of sodium
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sodium chloride, up to a total electrical
conductivity of 17.5 decibels per meter,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is much higher than what any farmer
would hope to find in their soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here I'm showing the effects on fruit
yield for the two tomato entries in this
[SPEAKER_06]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the red, that's denoting
the Fresh Market parent of the
[SPEAKER_06]: introgression line population.
[SPEAKER_06]: The green is the processing tomato hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see on the left here, pretty steep
decline in yield with increasing salt
[SPEAKER_06]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the highest level of salt that we
applied, the yield was maybe around 20% of
[SPEAKER_06]: what we saw under the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also see that the most precipitous
decline was from the control to the first
[SPEAKER_06]: level of salinity applied.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that, it kind of plateaued.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's interesting that we
haven't really followed up on,
[SPEAKER_06]: but seemed to be a curious result,
was although the response with these two
[SPEAKER_06]: different varieties was the same in their
total yield, the way that that was
[SPEAKER_06]: realized was different actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So selenium, the Fresh Market tomato
variety, showed a decrease in fruit
[SPEAKER_06]: weight, whereas the processing tomato
hybrid showed a decrease in fruit number,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that resulted in the same response in
terms of total yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the two wild species we had in this
experiment, we can't evaluate their fruit
[SPEAKER_06]: yield because they devote a really
negligible portion of their biomass to
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way that we looked at this was we
looked at their vegetative biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the results of this were kind of
surprising to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look again at the domesticated
tomato genotypes in this experiment
[SPEAKER_06]: represented in orange and green,
you can see that there wasn't really a
[SPEAKER_06]: strong response to selenium in terms of
their vegetative biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, under two of the salt dosages,
the Fresh Market tomato line showed
[SPEAKER_06]: greater vegetative biomass than under the
control.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two presumably resistant wild species
actually showed stronger declines in
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetative biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at citians, which is this teal
color here, you can see the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: from the control to the highest salt
concentration there.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the absolute difference,
it was fairly minor, but that's because
[SPEAKER_06]: selenium citians we found to be a
slow-growing plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't really much biomass to
decrease.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as a relative difference, actually it
had the steepest decline of all four of
[SPEAKER_06]: the entries in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was kind of like a disappointing
result.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want the donor of the trait that
you're hoping to introgress to show a
[SPEAKER_06]: poorer response than the parent you're
hoping to introgress it into.
[SPEAKER_06]: But after thinking about it a little more,
we decided maybe it's comparing apples to
[SPEAKER_06]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're comparing these species who don't
produce any fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't devote any energy to fruit
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And comparing their vegetative biomass to
tomato varieties that do devote a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: energy to fruit production, and we saw
that that fruit production was affected.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we moved forward with screening the
introgression lines, thinking that maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: in the background of domesticated tomato,
we'd be able to see more of the effects of
[SPEAKER_06]: the selenium citians genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started by looking at 27
introgression lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of the complete set was available
for dissemination when we started this
[SPEAKER_06]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also avoided lines carrying
introgressions in a heterozygous
[SPEAKER_06]: condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are introgressions where there's a
recessive lethal mutation in the
[SPEAKER_06]: background of domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to make our lives easier, we just
avoided working with those.
[SPEAKER_06]: We evaluated these under both control
conditions and a fertilizer treatment with
[SPEAKER_06]: about 75 millimolar sodium chloride.
[SPEAKER_06]: We completed the first replicate of this
last fall, and the second replicate we're
[SPEAKER_06]: hoping to wrap up in the next month or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here, as opposed to looking at the
wild species itself, here we were able to
[SPEAKER_06]: see an effect of selenity tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at the gene effects in the
background of domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this plot here, on the left,
I'm showing the distribution of fruit
[SPEAKER_06]: yield under the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the right is the distribution of fruit
yield under the salt treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lines connecting the performance
of individual genotypes between those two
[SPEAKER_06]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: The red line is the domesticated parent,
recurrent parent of the population,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the black lines are all introgression
lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw, unsurprisingly, that the
domesticated parent did pretty well for
[SPEAKER_06]: yield under control conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It ranked fifth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But under saline conditions, it ranked
17th in terms of its yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in terms of the severity of its
percent decline in yield, it ranked third.
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of all the entries, it showed the
third steepest response in terms of its
[SPEAKER_06]: difference in saline versus control
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The introgression lines ranged from a
response of about a decline similar to the
[SPEAKER_06]: domesticated parent, around 80%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best introgression lines showed a
decline in yield of around 45%.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also saw there were four introgression
lines that outyielded the domesticated
[SPEAKER_06]: parent under both control and salt
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are our immediate takeaways from
this experiment?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for one thing, by the fact that
almost all the introgression lines did
[SPEAKER_06]: better than the recurrent parent,
it seems like there are multiple genes
[SPEAKER_06]: distributed across the genome that provide
partial effects individually on salt
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: My background is in disease resistance
breeding and pathology, where we can
[SPEAKER_06]: identify single genes, R genes,
with major effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I probably should have done my
homework and read some more about plant
[SPEAKER_06]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_06]: This might not have been such a surprising
find in terms of abiotic stress
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this leads to the question,
are these genes, do they have effects that
[SPEAKER_06]: are large enough to be commercially
relevant?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can look at the lines that did the
best.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a 45% decline in yield compared
to an 80% for the domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can look at that two ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is 45% is much better than 80%.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, a 45% decline in yield is still
a 45% decline in yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that enough to be relevant
commercially?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to do further experiments to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we're interested in doing
is combining different introgressions that
[SPEAKER_06]: each had pretty good effects individually
and seeing what they look like in
[SPEAKER_06]: combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're currently doing a crossing block to
try to answer that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another question that we need to
answer is, can we reduce the sizes of
[SPEAKER_06]: these introgressions enough to get rid of
linkage drag while retaining the effects
[SPEAKER_06]: on salt tolerance?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of work to do,
but we're excited about this project.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just looking at the fruit yields
from the control on the left to salt on
[SPEAKER_06]: the right, except the pattern's actually
reversed with this lower picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to mislead anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the variation in response
among these lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And visually, it's pretty observable,
the impact that these introgressions have.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also moving on to look at other
traits that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these is freezing tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: The accession of salamsidians that was
used as the parent of this population was
[SPEAKER_06]: characterized and discovered growing at
really high elevations where the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature goes below zero degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pablo Bencourt is an intern in my lab
who's leading this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been really excited to see that
when you throw tomatoes in a grow chamber
[SPEAKER_06]: at pretty cold temperatures, they come out
looking like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you throw salamsidians in there,
it comes out looking like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like maybe a more far-fetched
project than even the salindi tolerance
[SPEAKER_06]: project.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we hope is that we can develop
tomato varieties that have freezing
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance as seedlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmers can transplant them to their
fields maybe a few weeks earlier than they
[SPEAKER_06]: typically would, get season extension,
maybe harvest tomatoes earlier in the
[SPEAKER_06]: season when prices are better,
and not have to worry about late spring
[SPEAKER_06]: frost.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Pablo, just this week, I think,
wrapped up screening the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: integration line population.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're interested in the results of
this project, come talk to him during the
[SPEAKER_06]: event today.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I want to move on and talk about
another project that we're doing focused
[SPEAKER_06]: on using heirloom tomato varieties in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to give a little bit of a
historical perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of modern tomato breeding,
so breeding trends in the 20th century,
[SPEAKER_06]: what those trends reflect are larger
ongoing trends in society at the time,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Industrialization of agriculture,
the commodification of produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's reflected in the traits that
breeders were selecting on, things like
[SPEAKER_06]: uniformity, firmness, fruit firmness and
shipability, fruit size, shape,
[SPEAKER_06]: and color, disease resistance,
yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have on their flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably was not a major trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quite under selection for a lot of
this modern tomato breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the end of the 20th century,
so starting maybe in the late 1980s or
[SPEAKER_06]: 1990s, the heirloom tomato started kind of
growing in popularity.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at this figure on the left,
this is showing the mentions of the term
[SPEAKER_06]: heirloom tomato in two newspapers from
1989 to 2005.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point, it was something that didn't
really exist in our popular consciousness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And within a few decades, it became
something that was common to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the result of maybe a few
different larger movements or trends
[SPEAKER_06]: happening in society that kind of
represented maybe a pushback against some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the industrialization of agriculture
that was happening at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Seed Savers Exchange was
established in 1975.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a network of individuals interested
in preserving seed that maybe was handed
[SPEAKER_06]: down to them in their family or in their
community, saving those varieties and
[SPEAKER_06]: distributing them among a network of other
seed savers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chefs like Alice Waters opened restaurants
that were the first to champion what we
[SPEAKER_06]: now refer to as farm-to-table cooking.
[SPEAKER_06]: They included items on their menus like
heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty soon, heirloom tomatoes became
ubiquitous at farmers markets,
[SPEAKER_06]: upscale restaurants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today, they're pretty common to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: In grocery stores at Wegmans here in
Ithaca, I can see them all year round
[SPEAKER_06]: grown in greenhouses in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what exactly is an heirloom tomato?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no scientific definition for this
term heirloom tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are a few different definitions
that are thrown around more popularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here are some of the most common ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They must be open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They must have been introduced more than
50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of an arbitrary cutoff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it means is that these aren't the
results of modern breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are heritage varieties that were
selected in a previous time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then according to this book,
Taylor's Guide to Heirloom Vegetables,
[SPEAKER_06]: they must have a history of their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of these varieties are
accompanied by stories like familiar lore
[SPEAKER_06]: about where these came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who originally selected them.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many generations they were passed
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That make them kind of more interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you do ask most people what an
heirloom tomato is, maybe I'll poll all of
[SPEAKER_06]: you later, I think they probably wouldn't
refer to these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, they'd probably be thinking of
visual traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that differentiate them from round,
round tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Differences in size, shape, and color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some defects that have been selected
against.
[SPEAKER_06]: Defects depending on who's deciding what a
defect is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things like green shoulders or scarring on
the blossom end of the fruit that are all
[SPEAKER_06]: associated with these varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are a few of my personal favorite
heirloom varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are also ones that are among the
most popular and most well known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cherokee purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brandy wine, both pink brandy wine and
yellow brandy wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Striped German.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've grown these in your garden,
maybe you'll agree with me that these are
[SPEAKER_06]: very delicious varieties of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And their quality in terms of eating them
fresh in a salad is really excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think part of the popularity of
heirloom tomatoes is not only for their
[SPEAKER_06]: cultural associations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they mean in terms of
self-sufficiency and seed saving and a
[SPEAKER_06]: pushback against industrialization of
agriculture, but also for their value in
[SPEAKER_06]: and of themselves as really excellent
varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in recent years, there's been kind of a
movement with some seed companies to
[SPEAKER_06]: develop varieties combining some of these
qualities found in heirloom tomatoes with
[SPEAKER_06]: traits more typical of modern high breeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things like disease resistance,
resistance to cracking, high yield
[SPEAKER_06]: potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a screenshot from high mowing seed
catalog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the terms that some of these
companies is using is high looms,
[SPEAKER_06]: a combination of hybrid and heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like that term a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a term that we're using in our
lab to describe the breeding efforts that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we started doing in the lab
was variety trials of commercial high loom
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you can see the harvest from these
varieties in bins in preparation for a
[SPEAKER_06]: field day we had last summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the variation in color,
how beautiful some of these varieties are.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the data that we collected,
we also saw that there have been pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: significant improvements in terms of many
agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this plot on the right is showing these
varieties in terms of their percent grade
[SPEAKER_06]: one fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the proportion of fruit that can be
marketed is USDA grade one, meaning free
[SPEAKER_06]: of blemishes and other defects.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at Brandywine Pink,
which is our heirloom check, the percent
[SPEAKER_06]: grade one was about 25%, which if you
think about that from a commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture perspective, that's pretty bad
if a farmer has to discount or throw away
[SPEAKER_06]: 75% of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these high loom varieties get up to
70%, so a pretty big improvement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also trial just normal standard slicer
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We found in our trials that the percent
grade one in those can get up to,
[SPEAKER_06]: say, 95%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's still probably our trade-offs
in terms of things like resistance to
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit defects, shipability, and traits
relating to eating quality, softness,
[SPEAKER_06]: texture, thickness of fruit skin,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another thing that we did when I first
started in 2023 was surveyed growers in
[SPEAKER_06]: New York about their perceptions of both
heirloom and high loom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was in collaboration with Teresa
Rusnik, vegetable specialist with Cornell
[SPEAKER_06]: Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_06]: And out of the 76 tomato growers in New
York who responded to our questionnaire,
[SPEAKER_06]: we found that about 3 quarters of them
grew heirloom varieties as a portion of
[SPEAKER_06]: their productions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of speaks to the demand that's
grown for this type of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fewer grew high loom varieties,
about 44%.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grew high loom varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we asked what the challenges that
they found associated with heirlooms,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were things that we weren't
surprised by, disease susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_06]: susceptibility to fruit defects,
and poor storability or shipability.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I found more interesting was when we
asked, what are your desired attributes in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of future high loom varieties?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they ranked these, the top four
were number one, resistance to diseases
[SPEAKER_06]: common of the open field, number two,
resistance to fruit defects, three,
[SPEAKER_06]: determinate growth habit, and four,
resistance to diseases more common in the
[SPEAKER_06]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that this is interesting to
me is that most of the seed companies
[SPEAKER_06]: currently are breeding types that are
indeterminate and maybe more adapted to
[SPEAKER_06]: the high tunnel or the greenhouse in terms
of their disease resistance package.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seemed like there were some needs
that still may be left needing to be
[SPEAKER_06]: addressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started crossing modern varieties
with heirloom varieties in 2023.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the modern lines that we're
using as parents, we're making use of
[SPEAKER_06]: lines developed at Cornell by my
predecessor, Martha Mutchler, who
[SPEAKER_06]: developed lines with a really
comprehensive disease resistance package
[SPEAKER_06]: to diseases in the open field in the
Northeast, including several novel
[SPEAKER_06]: diseases resistance genes in QTL that her
lab discovered.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we crossed a few of these lines
with a number of heirloom varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have four listed here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the populations that we carry
forward in the scheme that I'll show you
[SPEAKER_06]: in a few slides.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we made crosses with many more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the objective of this work is to
develop attractive, crack resistant,
[SPEAKER_06]: high flavor lines with strong open field
disease resistance and determinate growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been following a pretty aggressive
timeline to move this project forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the winter of 2023 and 2024,
we carried out two generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the crossing block.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the F1 generation in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The F2 in the field last year,
we used marker assisted selection to
[SPEAKER_06]: enrich those seedlings for the disease
resistance alleles, especially for the
[SPEAKER_06]: diseases that we were most interested in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We then made visual selections in the
field for fruit quality traits and for
[SPEAKER_06]: determinate growth habit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a determinate growth habit is a
concentrated flowering type that sets
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers in a short window and then kind of
stops growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The selections from that field here are a
picture of a couple that we're really
[SPEAKER_06]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we continue to see fruit like this,
we'll be very pleased.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we sent those to a winter nursery in
Costa Rica for single seed descent,
[SPEAKER_06]: so the F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this year, we plan to get back around
320 F4 families from this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are derived from 10 crosses,
these 320 families.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them are part of this high loom
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have crosses that are,
I guess you would say, modern standard
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties by modern standard varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: But six of them are from heirloom by
modern crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing that we're excited to do
with this population is use it as kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: a test case for how we might be able to
implement genomic selection in our tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this work is being led by Jack
Fabrizio, who's a postdoc in the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the specific strategy that we're
planning to use is what people call a test
[SPEAKER_06]: and shelf strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us, one of the biggest opportunities
that genomic selection poses to a
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetable breeder is the opportunity to
have our phenotypic data stretch further,
[SPEAKER_06]: collecting data like yield or fruit
quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a perishable crop that has to be picked
multiple times is really labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very difficult for us to do that in a
large number of entries.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we can do it on a certain number of
entries, then predict into a larger
[SPEAKER_06]: number, we think that can have pretty big
impact on our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year, out of these 320,
we're going to put 80% of them in the
[SPEAKER_06]: field, genotype those, phenotype them as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to predict on the
entire population, including the 20%,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're only genotyping and not
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's kind of a quick schematic of
what that would look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those 80% will be used to calculate
genomic estimated breeding values,
[SPEAKER_06]: including on the holdout set.
[SPEAKER_06]: So among that entire population of 320,
we'll select the top 10% across the entire
[SPEAKER_06]: population.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll carry these lines forward for
further product development, further
[SPEAKER_06]: testing and breeding, maybe creating some
test hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll also intermate those,
complete another cycle of modified single
[SPEAKER_06]: seed descent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we think that as we continue to
do this and generate more historical data,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can change the proportions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe in two years, when we have
another population of F4 lines,
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of phenotyping 80%, maybe we can
phenotype just 20%.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can include a larger population.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can use some of the historical data
as well to make predictions.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are lots of questions to answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the practical implementation of genomic
selection, not just in my program,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think personally in vegetables in
general, there's literature answering
[SPEAKER_06]: these questions in many agronomic crops
that haven't been addressed really in many
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us, we're really interested in how
well can we predict within families,
[SPEAKER_06]: across families, across market classes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are these high limb crosses going to be
predictive of standard tomato by standard
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato crosses?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many markers do we need?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is 1,000 enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: 1,000 is kind of the number that is
financially reasonable for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're hoping that's enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: What training population sizes are needed
to achieve reasonable prediction
[SPEAKER_06]: accuracies?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it's a lot of work to collect
this training data.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do we really need to collect in
order for this strategy to work?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then tomato is a crop that's primarily
marketed as F1 hybrids, even if the
[SPEAKER_06]: inbreeding depression is not as strong as
in a crop like corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be predicting the per se
value of these lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the right strategy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we instead be predicting general
combining abilities or specific combining
[SPEAKER_06]: abilities?
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that we're hoping to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to start wrapping up my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing that's kind of in common
across these two projects that I described
[SPEAKER_06]: is the fact that these traits that we're
interested in are quantitative traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the history of tomato breeding,
there's been tremendous progress in trait
[SPEAKER_06]: improvement, focusing on moving
qualitative major effect genes from wild
[SPEAKER_06]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of using similar approaches to
improve quantitative traits, it's probably
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be a bigger challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that we're doing that with these
high loom breeding populations,
[SPEAKER_06]: we think genomic selection might help.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're using breeding methods that we think
are suitable for the improvement of
[SPEAKER_06]: quantitative traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't expect necessarily to find
amazing varieties in that first cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might need a few generations of
recombination to break up linkages between
[SPEAKER_06]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we think that using this approach,
we can develop high quality lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the work we're doing with
salami sedians, where we found that there
[SPEAKER_06]: are multiple genes conferring resistance
to the stress tolerance that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in, the linkage drag is
probably so extreme that there's only a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain limitation in terms of how many of
the integrations we can practically use in
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's a world in which we can use
two of them or even three of them if we're
[SPEAKER_06]: able to reduce the size of those
integrations sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: But beyond that, it's probably not
feasible from a practical point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we probably need creative
solutions moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what those are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll be inspired by the rest of the
talks today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's a world in which we can use
these genetic resources, these populations
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been developed, the phenotyping
platforms that we're using to identify the
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic basis of these traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then perhaps instead of actually
introducing them into tomato, we can just
[SPEAKER_06]: make the edits in tomato through genome
editing corresponding to those genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: differences that lead to the phenotypic
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, I'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about the work that some of my
lab members are doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have the chance to talk about the
work that my students, Ivana Castillo and
[SPEAKER_06]: Diana Molder are doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing really exciting projects in
disease resistance genetics in tomato and
[SPEAKER_06]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank the work from former
lab members who have contributed
[SPEAKER_06]: especially to a lot of the field work that
we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the funding sources that we've
had for the projects that I've described,
[SPEAKER_06]: including the California Tomato Research
Institute, who's funding some of the work
[SPEAKER_06]: with Solanum sedians and salt tolerance,
USDA Federal Capacity Funds, Cornell,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Vegetable Breeding Institute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have time for any questions,
I'd love to answer them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll also be around the rest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to talking with some of
you then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_08]: More about your process for putting in on
your breeding goals and focus for this
[SPEAKER_08]: program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question was what the process was
for honing in on our breeding branch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was through a combination of
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're still working on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, the most important thing is to be
out there and talk to people, learn what
[SPEAKER_06]: problems are, learn what needs to be
addressed, learn what solutions already
[SPEAKER_06]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't need to be reinvented from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first year, especially my first
summer in my position, I tried every week
[SPEAKER_06]: to visit at least one different farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I traveled to different parts of the
state, got in touch with extension
[SPEAKER_06]: specialists in those regions, got
introduced to vegetable growers in those
[SPEAKER_06]: areas, just learned about what they did,
asked what varieties they liked,
[SPEAKER_06]: why they liked them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could have your ideal variety,
what would it look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: And those conversations really helped
contribute to a lot of the work that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing and how we're moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Lara.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is supposed to be all the work that
you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this idea of islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my question is, so you're looking at a
lot of the agronomic traits, but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: assuming a lot of the motivation of using
the heirlooms is to introduce some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those more unique flavor and base
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's, of course, a really hard thing
to quantify.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any plans to incorporate that
to your agronomic selection?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really excellent question.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question was, how do we plan to select
for flavor in this heirloom program?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really tough to select for flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our early generation nurseries,
we walk through and we do a lot of tasting
[SPEAKER_06]: that we get very sick of tomatoes very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm someone who loves tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never thought that would happen to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to start, we're looking at some things
that are relatively easy to quantify.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bricks, acidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do some taste testing too,
not formally, but informally, and see how
[SPEAKER_06]: well those traits are associated with our
informal assessments of flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to go from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, tomato flavor has been a lot of
literature on what controls our
[SPEAKER_06]: perceptions of tomato flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a mixture of sweetness,
acidity, and then lots of different
[SPEAKER_06]: volatiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And measuring those is obviously a lot
more work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to see how we can balance our
resources and do that efficiently moving
[SPEAKER_06]: forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Lance.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got two questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: It always strikes me that we've taken this
perennial shrub and we've kind of composed
[SPEAKER_11]: this annual lifestyle onto it,
especially for the wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we evaluating the traits of these
things too early in that first season?
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we gave them time to establish,
do you think they would be more resistant
[SPEAKER_11]: to some of the stressors?
[SPEAKER_11]: And the second question is, given those
big integrations and how divergent
[SPEAKER_11]: Citian's is, Roger probably couldn't break
those integrations up with crossover and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do you plan to go about breaking
these things down?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are good questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the first question was,
how do we evaluate phenotypes and salami
[SPEAKER_06]: sediums when it's probably a perennial and
its growth habit is so different?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the answer is we probably
didn't really do a good job of doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grew it almost hydroponically in a
greenhouse the way we grow normal
[SPEAKER_06]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a thing that's adapted to the
desert, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We put in a very different kind of
artificial condition and probably not the
[SPEAKER_06]: best way to assess the traits that we were
interested in assessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when you look at the effects of
portions of the genome of salami sediums
[SPEAKER_06]: in the background of domestic eutomea,
I think it's much easier to isolate and
[SPEAKER_06]: evaluate those traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your second question was, how do we
plan to break apart those recombinations?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't know how easy or difficult
it's going to be, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that we are planning to do it now
is to just try it and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's magical thinking,
but I guess the only way to find out is by
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Greg, for that great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering, you mentioned that
heirloom varieties have been maintained by
[SPEAKER_03]: seed savers and that kind of came out of a
response to modern agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: modern breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do they feel about hylums?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there acceptance within the existing
heirloom community?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they excited about disease resistance
or are they kind of not liking this?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question was, people who are really
attracted to heirlooms varieties for
[SPEAKER_06]: various reasons, how do they feel about
hybrid versions of those heirlooms?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a diversity of
opinions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people who are interested in
heirlooms primarily because of their
[SPEAKER_06]: flavor and appearance are open to new
varieties, even if they're hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other people who have political
opinions on F1 hybrids and the control of
[SPEAKER_06]: seed, intellectual property protection,
those people probably aren't as thrilled
[SPEAKER_06]: about the development of hybrid varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these heirloom varieties, for the
point of interest, we can only get them by
[SPEAKER_06]: writing a letter to somebody else who
saved them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: These varieties, seed of them,
are sold by all sorts of major seed
[SPEAKER_06]: companies and grown commercially now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the honor of being, I think,
the side of this symposium that's more
[SPEAKER_00]: about conservation, which you might see or
you might remember is in the title itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Conserving and Utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like an honor and also a
responsibility to bring the other half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the equation to what seems like a really
strong and wonderful community,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly of plant breeders, genetics folks
and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a great community for me to connect
with and to speak with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the invite to the graduate
student organizers and to Cornell and to
[SPEAKER_00]: Corteva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not take for granted
opportunities to get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate, especially in this day and
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal, I think, above all else with this
talk is to engage you and enroll you even
[SPEAKER_00]: in how important that side, the
conservation side is to your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's see how I do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real photo, by the way,
and not just a screensaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the Great Sand Dunes National
Park in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a wild relative that I'll talk
a little bit about a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm going to be talking about
things like this flower on the left side
[SPEAKER_00]: and its relation to the flower on the
right side and how those two are still
[SPEAKER_00]: related after so many millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a reflection, when I started in
this work like 25 years ago, I do feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like we were all the weirdos that they
didn't know what to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: tri-societies meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had sort of our own little group that
nobody came to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four people in the audience and
all of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the crop wild relative people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that the plant breeders
weren't using the wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly were in all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was much lower on the awareness
screen there, I think, at the societies
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in the conservation world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been this huge sort of shift as
I've seen it into public awareness,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all of these articles around wild
foods or wild relatives or genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, even terms like that that you
never thought might end up in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might have seen that the World
Food Prize this year was given to
[SPEAKER_00]: conservationists, including of wild
relatives of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all kinds of crazy things are
happening in the world with the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true not just of public
awareness, but even in our very largest
[SPEAKER_00]: global or international accords and
agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the Sustainable Development
Goals and the new agreements and the older
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements of the Convention on Biological
Diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really our largest international
instruments of countries agreeing with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other about biodiversity,
about food and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all saying things like wild
species and wild relatives in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is wild in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually was not an intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple of slides that are a
little bit simple for you all in this
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will put a few definitions out and a
little bit of the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I keep a really simple wild
relatives or wild plants that are related
[SPEAKER_00]: to our domesticated crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you saw from the tomato group and from
the brassica talk and others, the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: definition or which plants are in and
which plants are out for each crop varies
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wheat one, the wheat talk coming
up after me is another example of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way of defining the edges of the
wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory behind this goes back 50 years
or 53 years now to some science that was
[SPEAKER_00]: really based mostly on crossing,
on breeding studies and seeing what could
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with one another and the coming up
with this kind of onion concept of the
[SPEAKER_00]: center being the crop and its related
species, same species that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you go out from the onion,
it gets less related and more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, those boundaries have really
fallen through modern tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can you can double chromosomes
easier and you can do these bridges with
[SPEAKER_00]: other species as mentioned in the brassica
and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the edges of the gene pool two and
three and out from there are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzier over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in the picture of
like who is a wild relative for what crops
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in, there is a wonderful
database, probably the only like truly
[SPEAKER_00]: global database run by USDA Grin Global
Taxonomy with that link there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope these presentations are available
to everyone after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to make mine, but there's a lot
of links in this presentation if useful to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go there and you can put in your
crop of interest and it will start to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you based on literature who are the wild
species and what have they been used for
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple of reviews of the
uses of wild relatives over the last 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years or 100 years in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially the trends are there's
more and more publications, folks saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're using wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is not the private sector
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's being published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's even higher the number of
uses, of course, when you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: privates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you might have seen already
from the talks we've had, the major major
[SPEAKER_00]: use is so far primarily pest and disease
resistance, also abiotic stress tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two final points as we just get into it
about wild relatives that I like to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you all as a very educated crowd
will not be surprised by this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the complexities of their use are
wondrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, of course, still just
bringing in single genes for important
[SPEAKER_00]: traits like pest resistance, but then
there's much more, I'm not saying any
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse, but much more complex
versions like grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what grape is, for those who don't
know, and I know this is a big crop in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, grape has a top, the scion that can
be different than the bottom, the root
[SPEAKER_00]: stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That top scion is still mostly in most
places in the world, one species,
[SPEAKER_00]: the domesticated species, vinifera,
but that is not the only species that's
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there's more and more coming
along of hybrids with vinifera and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a case, this is a rather
extreme case of this chambersine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, we don't actually even know all
the different species in it, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the list of six or actually seven
different species actually in this hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown on the East coast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the root stock there is,
now almost by standard or by definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of three or four different wild
species from North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how grapes are really able to grow
around the world for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the landscape really of
wild relatives and of how much they're
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, really integrated into
some of our most major crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to put this picture up here for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is because this is Cornell work,
seminal work from 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was one of these papers that really
did start to raise the awareness and
[SPEAKER_00]: change maybe people's minds, even
breeder's minds about using wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Dr. McCooch, who's maybe listening
in online, this is a kind of a synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, and it was making several points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is that you don't always know
what's in these plants, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder and also the challenge of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the photo here, the A was the wild
relative, which was spoken about by our
[SPEAKER_00]: first speaker here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The B on the left side there, that was the
domesticated version before the
[SPEAKER_00]: integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right side of that is actually after
the cross with this green tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a darker red version of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that darker trait came actually from
the wild green relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom side on the C,
this is a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I believe, pimpinella folium
crossing with that medium sized tomato to
[SPEAKER_00]: get even a larger tomato through that
vigor effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't always know what you're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the talk that I am going to give today
also, as much as it's about plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: about genes and concepts, conservation,
it's really also about people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservation really can't happen by an
individual or institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger and more collaborative it is,
the more it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relationships matter to conservation
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a big first step 15 years
ago through a mega global project called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cropout Relatives Project that was 50
million euros through the government of
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that enabled giant steps forward in
trying to understand who are the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives of our major crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well are they conserved in seed banks
or gene banks around the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit more about that
in a minute and then start to do more
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-breeding around those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an important project for me
because I got to do my PhD as part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's still having its major
effects around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many institutions, including Cornell,
were part of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit as part of that project,
on the far right side, one of my chapters
[SPEAKER_00]: of my PhD was starting to just try to
understand who are these resources in
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we published an inventory for the
United States of what is this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be talking mainly about
North America in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to list that Mexico came along
with their version also in CropSci a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years later and then the
Canadians a couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have wonderful now resources to
just understand lists basically of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably 15 or 20 other countries
that have now published national
[SPEAKER_00]: inventories for their wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a really neat baseline of
understanding what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to give you a short idea of who's
out there, we have this pie chart that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a little sense of how big the
slice is that are related to these major
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the narrowed down,
most prioritized set of species that we
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize basically based on how
important the crop is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got a lot of blackberry and
blueberry relatives and grapes and pecans
[SPEAKER_00]: and peaches and plums and sunflowers and
other things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to talk actually for a
minute about why we have diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, which I'm just going to
talk about the United States and Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: when not that many crops were domesticated
in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map I worked on a while back
that it's certainly not every crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, but it's most of the crops that we
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 80 or 100 crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just call it where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very educated crowd,
but where more or less they arose the
[SPEAKER_00]: region part of the world and where their
genetic diversity is richest and where
[SPEAKER_00]: their wild relatives tend to be richest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a few things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that plants were domesticated in
many parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're animals, not just one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I was taught in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still angry about this, that
agriculture arose in the Fertile Crescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually many dozens, or even hundreds
of places, crops were domesticated by
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds or thousands of cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically understood to be
maybe 28 to 32 kind of very rich centers
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of innovation was going on,
typically 4,000 to 12,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see that North America is not
the biggest list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a smaller list.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again, not the whole list of
crops, but there's blueberries there and
[SPEAKER_00]: those currants or ribes, grapes,
some pumpkins, sunflowers, strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: pecans, some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have four reasons I'm gonna try to
argue with you of why we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: this giant inventory of 5,000 species that
are related to crops here in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is because we do have
these native domesticates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is people that were here in this part
of the world were checking out the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and realized that some of them were
really awesome and started growing them
[SPEAKER_00]: and domesticating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got bigger and more useful and
more edible and their wild relatives are
[SPEAKER_00]: still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is that there is a very rich
diversity of crops that were domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: south of here, Mesoamerica and further
south.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's corn, and other types of squash and
chili peppers and potatoes and tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: and many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have wild relatives, cousins,
Northern cousins, ones that live up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in more temperate regions, but are related
to those crops to the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for instance, Tripsicum,
which is a wild relative of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a researcher of that here,
Dr. Denise Costich in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's our kind of, let's call it
a, there's versions that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: temperate of maize that are up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three is that as a temperate
region, we also have cousins or wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives that are cousins to crops that
were domesticated in other temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of the world in Europe and in East
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of wild plums and
apricots and almonds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were the domesticates were
domesticated elsewhere, but the relatives
[SPEAKER_00]: are also here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number four is that we have weeds,
invasives that come from other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are problematic as weeds,
things like in the West where I'm from,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild oats or wild beets, wild lettuce,
but they are also genetic resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are also crop wild relatives and they
can be used for breeding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the four reasons,
my major four reasons why this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a very rich part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though other parts of the world,
they're just as rich in this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: flora that is useful for people through
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we'll talk about it, at the end of
this presentation for other reasons too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been using wild relatives for a
long time that are native to this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just four examples of real uses of
our native resources and wild relatives in
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflowers and in filberts or hazelnuts in
maize and in walnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of the story, and in my
contractual obligation as a
[SPEAKER_00]: conservationist to start really into this
conservation story here is that
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately a lot of those species are
threatened or endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all four of these are listed
under our Endangered Species Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the species are not listed,
but these are lucky enough I suppose you
[SPEAKER_00]: could call it to be listed and regulated
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we do about these species
that are useful to us that are wild that
[SPEAKER_00]: are threatened?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we do is we put
them in seed banks or gene banks as we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture from the National
Laboratory in Fort Collins located in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a USDA facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full term is National Laboratory for
Genetic Resources Preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the national backup repository for
the United States system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our previous speaker who spoke about
the use of the brassica collection from
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA, this would be where the long-term
collection that's kept for decades or
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of years is kept to make sure
that it stays alive and is around and can
[SPEAKER_00]: be replenished out into the more active
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active sites, I'd like to talk about
this system just for a minute if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active sites in the USDA system are
all across the United States and that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense because different crops grow
in different parts of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and the desire is to have these active
sites really working in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That system is the largest probably
national system in the world in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: how active it is in doing the research to
keep the seeds alive, but also developing
[SPEAKER_00]: useful information like what color and
what size and all of that basic
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping work and then distributing
seeds to plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I really want to make sure is
understood is that this is one national
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many around the world,
which I'll get to in a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that national system which is
supported by the public then is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: major foundations for plant breeding
through universities, through private
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that then become the seeds that
go out to farmers around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without that system, it would be a
much more fragile or unstable system going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in terms of the future of new
varieties and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we even have backups of backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the most famous seed bank
or team bank around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Svalbard Global Seed Vault,
which is our tertiary backup here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is we put seeds, we have our active
sites and then we put them in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we also put them in Svalbard,
which is a Norwegian territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other countries, they don't have that
Colorado version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their backup is at Svalbard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a safety deposit box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't pay for it as a country,
but you put your seeds up there and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else has access to them except you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get them back when you need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of all the gene banks
around the world, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size of the circle is the size of
the collections just in terms of number of
[SPEAKER_00]: what are called accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both national seed banks or gene
banks, but also international ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are held in trust kind of for the
global community, not just for a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to mention, even with the
national ones like the USDA, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: considered only for the country
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the distributions go out around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really is a global network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense because of that
earlier map that you might remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: crops came from places, but we don't need
them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow them everywhere, the major crops
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize is vital in Africa and rice is vital
in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of those reasons, we need genetic
resources to be able to flow across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you figure out if your
collections are complete?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to go collect more,
how are we doing in terms of making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that these plants that are threatened in
the wild, because of habitat destruction,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of pollution, contamination,
and over-harvesting, and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, how do we make sure that they're
in the seed banks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are techniques that are
geographic to try to start to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: where the species live and whether we've
gone to collect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a good part of my PhD,
was starting to do research like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically the richness of beans,
of fasciolus, the whole group of 80 or so
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that darker color in the middle is
where they're richest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world, which is central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the picture on the right is where
they are richest, but we have not
[SPEAKER_00]: collected them well enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that also became a major paper
during that global project that was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the wild relatives of all the major
crops around the world, over a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: wild relatives that we consider the most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an old figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a little bit hard to see at
this point, but the dark red would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: richest places to go for wild relatives if
you wanted to find as many as you could in
[SPEAKER_00]: one single five kilometer by five
kilometer grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just get a little bit more into
the methodology that we use to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain what we're trying to do here on
the conservation side or planning side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one of our wild grapes
that occurs in Texas, sweet mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we bring in information
that come typically from plant museums
[SPEAKER_00]: called herbaria or other types of museums,
or increasingly from citizen science
[SPEAKER_00]: applications like iNaturalist,
where people have marked, I've seen this
[SPEAKER_00]: in the wild and this is where I saw it,
which you can now do on your phone very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily and map those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the species has been
seen, those gray spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it occurs basically in central Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one other dot that you'll see
there, which is the same kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: except this is actually where it's been
collected and put into a germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: repository, a seed bank or a botanic
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can already get a sense that,
okay, well, it's been collected once from
[SPEAKER_00]: one spot in the farthest north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have all the genetics that we need
in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now all this geographic stuff is
based on hypotheses that geography has a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, if you go to somewhere different,
then you'll get different genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do some modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a guesstimate of where we think
the species occurs based on where we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it plus climate and soil attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the green is where we think the
species might occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can draw a buffer around where
we've already gone and collected and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, maybe we don't need to go back there
in the purple, but all of the orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's left of the distribution
we haven't been to is where we might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back to and collect more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we call conservation gap
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually 12.5% of the distribution,
the positive distribution of the species
[SPEAKER_00]: has been collected from, and the rest
hasn't yet in terms of this rather simple
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some other metrics that try to
collect from every different ecoregion or
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil type and such to try to get
an idea of sort of the ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other side of it is now not
thinking so much about gene banks or seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks, but thinking about how well
protected are these species in the wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, in national parks, forests and
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a similar methodology for
in situ of essentially how much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: range is in national parks and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was put together a few years ago
into a national gap analysis that tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're doing in terms of 600 of our
native wild relatives here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map is a heat map, a richness map
of all of them together, 600 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like hopefully to get two
messages out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is no matter where you go,
there's a wild relative underneath you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just the 600 most important to us in
terms of relation to very important crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is up here in New York,
maybe you're slightly out of that red,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're in a hotspot pretty much here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker colors is more species
occurring in the same areas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of metrics that we
came up with to try to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned a series of metrics around
ex situ conservation status that's in seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene banks or botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other side is in protected
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in situ conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these black dots is one of the
species, one of the 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this scale from zero, which is
we're doing very terrible on our
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation and 100 as you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you can see green over
there versus red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of get a sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ex situ, we got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the species are in that high
urgent priority category for further
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In situ is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you combine them, we still got a lot of
work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just grouping the species in
slightly different ways into the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops or their associated crop itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just take some water while you
take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another contractual obligation of being
a conservationist is to have the doom and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloom story just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's my doom and gloom story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot to do to really conserve
these resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, let me just emphasize,
if we don't have them in the seed banks
[SPEAKER_00]: and gene banks, they're really not that
accessible for the plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to be doing that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we also make this information
useful so people can go out and do that
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been building websites and making
the information publicly available and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really great website where
you can actually explore those 600 species
[SPEAKER_00]: on a USDA ArcGIS basically site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to get to know where they are and
how well they've been collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a coder, we've developed an R
code called gap analysis dot R,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can do your own analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're rebooting that because it's a
little bit outdated right now with its
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited that we're now working on a
project for the non-coders, which are most
[SPEAKER_00]: gene bank people, by the way, where online
you can bring in data from some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: big global database sites like GBIF,
which is the Global Biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: Information Facility, or iNaturalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can bring in your own data as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can figure out which of those points
are just sightings versus which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in gene banks or botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own buffer size and you
can do your own gap analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not quite yet ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go play with it already on that
link, or there's a link on the last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another year, and hopefully this will
be really ready for prime time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say unfortunately, this project was
just canceled due to federal funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're hoping to still move it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: iNaturalist, I have fallen in love with
citizen science myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mentioning, I created this own group
project on iNaturalist of just what are
[SPEAKER_00]: these wild relatives in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 2.7 million observations of
observations of these species around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what an incredible resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if 10% of them are misidentified,
what an incredible resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of information on them is just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm fully in on the citizen science
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with our Forest Service
and other land management partners to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what's on their lands and to be
able to protect them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really incredible story of how
these collaborations started with land
[SPEAKER_00]: managers in the United States some 25,
30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had a designation already of
an area that was on Forest Service land,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hadn't been designated yet for
anything around botanical interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was designated as a wild chili
botanical preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's south of Tucson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever in that area, you can go
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's still special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the US only has one or two
really sites on public lands that are
[SPEAKER_00]: explicitly to conserve a crop while
relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the progenitor of chili
pepper, capsicum annuum, and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: barely creeps up into the United States in
a couple of places in Texas, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is conserving one of those
populations, which is near Tucson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to expand that work by letting
the Forest Service know what's on their
[SPEAKER_00]: lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing that kind of modeling
for them on all Forest Service lands of
[SPEAKER_00]: which species might be there, and then
going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a further version of that that then
starts to integrate genetics, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really fun, is a wild cranberry project,
which is a collaboration between USDA's Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Service and Forest Service,
and identifying, in this case actually
[SPEAKER_00]: across most of the East Coast,
different populations of wild cranberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then doing genetics to figure out how
much they differ genetically to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the most interesting different
populations that might be specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: designated in these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see just by the vegetation
here how different the ecologies are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is everything from, well,
actually there's some West Coast stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but everything from kind of north
all the way south to West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This presentation is certainly not just my
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also colleagues around the continent
around the world that are doing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just a little bit on the Canadian
and Mexican efforts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been, as mentioned, quite a lot
of just inventorying and then mapping and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand where the species
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as thought and as expected along
the southern border of Canada is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the richest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also true to some degree in the
United States, although as you saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this northern range because of so
many berries and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are more temperate there,
but we have a lot of richness also on our
[SPEAKER_00]: southern border in Texas, Arizona,
New Mexico, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of berries up there in Canada that
are, I think, a lot of the efforts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are most active right now doing
work in Canada on the native wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives are around their cranberries,
which are culturally significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: also significant for wildlife,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, huge diversity, also a lot of
studies of who they are and what their
[SPEAKER_00]: risks are in terms of disappearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna convey a message that has been
driven home to me by colleagues from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, which is somewhat of a different
way of framing and understanding these
[SPEAKER_00]: species because there is still a lot of
integration with traditional agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are systems still with beans
and maize and other cultivation systems
[SPEAKER_00]: where the wild relatives are occurring in
the same area as the domesticated fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is gene flow, often both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're understood in less as just
sort of this kind of historic thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bring genes and take them and put
them in, but also as part of this dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: system of traditional agriculture where
there is still gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different way of seeing it and an
important aspect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing work together,
publishing books and such around what is
[SPEAKER_00]: this richness and what are we doing about
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of volumes, if you're interested
in over a thousand pages of North American
[SPEAKER_00]: Cropile Relatives, and then starting to
really reach out to a wider audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the public and eaters,
diners, if you will, around these wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives or wild foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an example of several
different events that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was in Tucson where it's a wonky,
I think it's a funny experiment in and of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of do wonky science-y stuff,
bring together scientists and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you also throw parties for the public
with chefs that bring in the public that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to taste alcohols made from wild
relatives or interesting food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go down to preserves like the Wild
Chili Preserve and see them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an interesting experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been very fun to try to
message this still kind of middle land
[SPEAKER_00]: between wildness and agriculture threats
and food security all together into a
[SPEAKER_00]: message that kind of combines all of our
challenges in the world and all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: issues we got to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working in the Botanic Garden
world for the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to mention that because it's
the other side of the whole world of ex
[SPEAKER_00]: situ conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where we put things into frozen
storage or into live plants and gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as you saw that picture of all
the gene banks around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is also these thousands of Botanic
Gardens around the world who are also
[SPEAKER_00]: holding crops, actually, and their wild
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do it for somewhat different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're making efforts to come together
to do conservation altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our repositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the ways for arguing for
that, which is a little simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you'll allow me, this is another
map of the richness of wild relatives in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those buildings are the different USDA
sites that I mentioned, the active
[SPEAKER_00]: research and collection sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is there in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine the number of different
people working there and what they're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you map all the Botanic Gardens
on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all their botanical expertise around
being able to identify species or go out
[SPEAKER_00]: or collect and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might imagine that you could do
more working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to be part of a really fun
project almost 10 years ago that Dr. Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Searle also up there was a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had never met each other,
actually, before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both on the more ag side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all these Botanic Garden people
that I'd never met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all about like, could we work
together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could we do something on crop our
relatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided through that to come up
with a roadmap for North America on what
[SPEAKER_00]: do we got to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published that in the Crop Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published it in a Botanic Garden
Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published it for land managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has five tenants to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the big picture of how do
we deal with this giant richness of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that is threatened, that is
important for our food security,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant breeders need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first one is we still got to do
science about who are these species and
[SPEAKER_00]: where do they live and how well collected
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is we got to protect them
in their natural habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not still evolving in their
natural habitats, then they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving alongside pests and diseases and
changes in the weather and climate and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is we got to put them in the
seed banks and gene banks so that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved for the long term, but they're
also available to plant breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth is we got to do the value
addition of phenotyping and all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, pre-reading to get them ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fifth one is public awareness
and outreach, which the Botanic Gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: are particularly posed to do good work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just a couple kind of last slides
that are about that networking or that
[SPEAKER_00]: growing network of people that are really
working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the Botanic Garden world then and
the gene bank world has come together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to figure out what is the low
hanging fruit for us to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually turns out that fruit and
nuts is a low hanging fruit for us because
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens have live trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often have whole plants and have
enough space for them, whereas the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: banks struggle to have enough field space
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes a lot of sense to work
together in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gardens that have giant apple
collections, for instance, the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a network that's been
happening for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working on these 10 genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in any of them,
please get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very active network of
understanding who the species are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of money so that
folks can go out and do collecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bring them into the Botanic Gardens
or gene banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is three pictures from my own
work at the San Diego Botanic Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in these collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two wild plums from native to
California, one of which is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare and endangered, the desert one
on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a wild walnut in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great network of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also put on a symposium last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite an experiment, I would say,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a reboot after that first
work 10 years ago of getting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was where we at and how do we go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still some really good
resources on that website that you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, before I get to that,
let me just go back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I really hope to express
is that I think also in the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: as our working in this field has deepened
in this region, we've also started to move
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond that simpler understanding at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all we're doing really is just
grabbing genes and bringing them over,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is wonderful and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing at all wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bigger picture of what are these
wild plants and how can they be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has broken down all kinds of
terminological silos like wild or even
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop, first of all, what is a crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have to be cultivated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the plants here in North
America that aren't particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated but are food resources and very
interesting, like pawpaws or a plant I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: about to show you in a minute?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what the heck does wild mean
anyway as we start to realize that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have been managing wild populations
forever anyway through burning or
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting or management?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our understanding is less now that
there's just wild stuff and you bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: over into the domesticate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's this giant spectrum of plants
that have been associated to more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: of a degree with people for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we want to do about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do we want to go forward from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get back to that in a minute for
a last point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the networking side, I wanted to
mention something actually very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that in the botanic garden
world, they've started to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: global networks to do important work on
really important taxonomic groups like
[SPEAKER_00]: oaks or cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cycad out in that nice little
green area out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are often very threatened
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this whole group of thousands of
institutions through a network like this
[SPEAKER_00]: getting together to conserve all the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very excited and proud to say that
the 10th, no, sorry, the 12th,
[SPEAKER_00]: quick math there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 12th Global Conservation Consortium
has just been agreed upon for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be focused on food
plants, including crop wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really brings the whole
botanic garden world of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions connected with team banks
around the world to try to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: about crop wild relatives, but also about
all these wild food plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly threatened around the world,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, OK, so now finally I get to this
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I have enough time to express
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a deep breath for a
minute and try to give you one last big
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such a great institution and so
many amazing brains and creativity here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really agree with the previous speakers
that spoke about what an amazing place
[SPEAKER_00]: this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking care of our major crops,
I think in the title of this symposium as
[SPEAKER_00]: wild relatives of our major crops,
is of utmost importance in terms of those
[SPEAKER_00]: crops' future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep this diversification
process going on or bringing in new
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, my own feeling is that that's
just the beginning of what agriculture can
[SPEAKER_00]: look like with these wild plants or
semi-wild plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even use the word wild, these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, anybody know what this plant is by
chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a groundnut, American groundnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Apios Americana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that was incredibly
important in Native American food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say agriculture, if you'd like,
all the way from St. Louis to Cape Cod at
[SPEAKER_00]: one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is kind of barely around anymore,
mostly by hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a USDA collection in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is known to be really associated with
people because it's a triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a native distribution as a diploid,
a fertile diploid, but these triploids are
[SPEAKER_00]: what are occurring all the way from St.
Louis to Cape Cod with bigger tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legume tuber, high protein,
higher protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my own, actually, harvest in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of marginal.
[SPEAKER_00]: To collect it there, which I fed during
Thanksgiving to my family, it was known to
[SPEAKER_00]: be probably one of those foods eaten in
the first Thanksgivings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, my family had no idea how
there was this like teaspoon each that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought it was pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of these plants that I
want to express for those that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and privilege to think outside
the box about new crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of these crops that really
could be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an association in the world
with tuber, people who are predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on tubers and protein
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a crop like this could also be an
incredible crop for other regions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to mention two other examples
that I think are really neat that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming along that are not so much about
bringing genes over, but thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing entire plants into food systems
or our agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work by my colleague,
Dr. Nolan Kane, and colleagues in
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Colorado, also USDA and
other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a native flax that you can see
in its native distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that map on that side, widely
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is work that was also referred
to a little bit in an earlier presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: around the promise or opportunities of
perennial crops in more sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty neat one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already has good oil content,
like the domesticated flax that is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's already in wildflower mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of know how to grow it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just figuring out the
agronomic systems and bumping up the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is some really great work
like this going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To those who want to talk more about that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a last slide, so here's a
question that my mentor and my postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Allison Miller from the Danforth
Center in St. Louis University in St.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis, asks, which are the wild relatives
of our future crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: And her argument, which I agree,
is they are certainly the wild relatives
[SPEAKER_00]: of wheat and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rice and maize and tomato and
brassica, the canola and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if our future crops are also other
things, then our wild relatives are also
[SPEAKER_00]: other things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go much beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is some really excellent and
interesting work about trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, for instance, if you want to go
perennial, how many herbaceous perennials,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the Land Institute type
thinking on productive perennial systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could mow and things like that,
how many are there out there in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of grasses, in fact,
there's almost 8,000 perennial herbaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses that could be looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do we whittle that down to 20
or 30 or 50 or a couple hundred that might
[SPEAKER_00]: really be promising next step crops for
the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so inspired by this because this is
the kind of long-term big picture thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe 500 years from now we end up
with 20 or 30 or a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops that we're eating and how
exciting and interesting that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that it just drove home just a
little bit how important the foundational
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger thinking and conservation work is
to plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of links to these websites and data
resources and papers at the end over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't mind me asking,
how do you define a crop in that case?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll try to answer your question in
some helpful or meaningful way in any
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I, well, I don't have off the top of
my head something that, yeah, I do
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is humans are incredibly
innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously we're doing all kinds of
crazy things like cell phones,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think probably the biggest,
most incredible innovation that's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: happened is agriculture itself,
which is this huge process of just of
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing what's around and then working
with that diversity and changing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: this coevolutionary process where
everybody needs everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans need the plants or animals,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't, it wasn't just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we capitalized on other
animals quite a lot in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly with fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so avocados, for instance,
didn't actually go from this to that like
[SPEAKER_00]: maize did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avocados actually went from this to that
because they were already being eaten by
[SPEAKER_00]: and selected by megafauna in this case in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think maybe that's something that
gets to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I want to say that's
also really important is, as many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably know, the more we know about
plant systems, especially plant systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we're hoping is more sustainable
agricultural systems that have living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and such, the more we realize that
the cropping systems are actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex with microbiota, with pollinators,
including things like bats.
[SPEAKER_00]: For agaves and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those things aren't all still
working, then you really don't have your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant system that in cases like agaves are
sometimes a little bit contentiously,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but not even called plants
anymore, but holobionts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there's so many organisms
that have to work together that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have the plant, it's really not the
thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need all the microorganisms and you
need the pollinators and you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: people, the whole shebang.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so in my mind, and I haven't
researched this recently, I could be
[SPEAKER_09]: wrong, but I feel like a lot of the
threats to conservation and natural
[SPEAKER_09]: diversity are driven by capitalist market
forces.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I always thought that it's kind of
hard to quantify the language those forces
[SPEAKER_09]: are conversing in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the value of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were really deeply steeped in
plants, agriculture, and motherness,
[SPEAKER_09]: that value was kind of inherent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not perspective, but now that you
seem to have this very high level picture
[SPEAKER_09]: of genetic diversity in these crop oil
species across America and across the
[SPEAKER_09]: world, and we're also developing a pretty
clear understanding of the impact that
[SPEAKER_09]: diversity can have on our agricultural
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel like there could be a
quantification of the potential economic
[SPEAKER_09]: value of genetic diversity in these crop
oil species?
[SPEAKER_09]: And would that quantification be a useful
argument for conservation efforts,
[SPEAKER_09]: if it could be made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there have been, for 30 years,
economic valuations of genetic resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: including crop oil relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among research groups, there's a person
named Melinda Smale, who I think had some
[SPEAKER_00]: associations with Cornell, in fact,
and some at other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did some preliminary work as well
as a group in USDA, the Economic Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look up some of that early
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the valuations are specific
to genetic innovations, and they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: in the millions, if not billions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the economic arguments,
I think, have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do one for the whole, like what is the
value of wild relatives economically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's come up with the
single number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's a crazy thing to even
attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are any economists in the
crowd that want to give it a try,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be incredible to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not placed to say, as an economist or
a policy person or anything, which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: none of those, how effective those
arguments are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that money talks to some
degree, and we should still be speaking in
[SPEAKER_00]: those languages to drive home the ever
important message that we need genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Henry, for the kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the Symposium Organizing
Committee for all their hard work in
[SPEAKER_02]: putting this event together, as well as to
Corteva for sponsoring the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited to be here today to
share some pieces of my PhD research with
[SPEAKER_02]: you, which is focused on maintaining
diversity within the Kansas State
[SPEAKER_02]: University wheat breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we think about wheat performance
over time, we have seen sustained genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: gain in terms of wheat yields,
specifically around the adoption of green
[SPEAKER_02]: revolution varieties in the 1970s and
1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a significant spike in our wheat
yield increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this genetic gain for yield,
while it is still increasing, is
[SPEAKER_02]: decelerating to where this might suggest a
potential plateau and improvement in wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at any point when we start to lose
improvement for a certain trait,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can become very prudent to go back and
look at those more diverse sources or wild
[SPEAKER_02]: relatives to be used in breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: When thinking about what makes up the
overall wheat yield, we can think of it as
[SPEAKER_02]: a trade-off between our source traits and
our sink traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our source traits are going to be those
traits that are more important in the
[SPEAKER_02]: early stage of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Development of adequate levels of biomass
will determine photosynthetic efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventual translocation to the sink
filling organs, which are on the right
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sink filling organs are going to be
more important during senescence and grain
[SPEAKER_02]: filling period to where these are the ones
that have been historically prioritized
[SPEAKER_02]: the most in increasing wheat yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our increases in wheat yield over
time has come because of increases to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest index, which is shown in this
bi-pot analysis, where grain yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest index have the highest amount of
co-variation compared to these other yield
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in thinking that many of our
improvements to yield have come because of
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest index, if we want to keep making
improvements, we may need to start
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing more on this right side of the
triangle in those source traits,
[SPEAKER_02]: while keeping in the back of our minds
that we have to make sure to optimize this
[SPEAKER_02]: trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have enough biomass to
photosynthesize early in the season,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also have to leave enough time to
fill grain later on in the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in thinking about how we can do this in
wheat specifically, wheat has a
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated genetic history in terms of
its evolution and domestication,
[SPEAKER_02]: which provides several opportunities for
crop-wild growth and wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very thankful to Collin for
introducing the onion concept of the
[SPEAKER_02]: primary, secondary, and tertiary gene
pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: When thinking about wheat, the primary and
secondary species that are in the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pool are going to be those ones that have
genomes in common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are going to be the ones that are
shown on this slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to go over just in detail the steps
that occurred in generating our hexafloid
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat or triticum astibum, the first
species that were involved were the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: grass species, which donated the A and B
genomes to form tetraploid triticum
[SPEAKER_02]: turgidum subspecies dicocoides,
which is also known as wild emmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further domestication, rose-made
cultivated emmer or triticum turgidum
[SPEAKER_02]: subspecies dicocum come about.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the free-threshing character was
conferred, durum wheat arose.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what is used in our pasta
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: These free-threshing tetraploids were also
the tetraploid donor for bread wheat,
[SPEAKER_02]: which when hybridized with the D genome
donor, agelopsitaceae, formed hexafloid
[SPEAKER_02]: triticum astibum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things to notice about the
evolutionary history of wheat is that
[SPEAKER_02]: there were two hybridization events,
each associated with their own genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the makeup of the wheat genome,
there have been many opportunities to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: out on genetic diversity coming from these
wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I want to point out is
that this species, wild emmer
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, can be considered the
central conduit of gene flow between the
[SPEAKER_02]: wild diploid species and our cultivated
durum and bread wheats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are several main approaches to
gene integration.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very straightforward approach would just
be through making direct crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be limited to species within the
primary and secondary gene pools to where
[SPEAKER_02]: myotic recombination will not be very
successful if the chromosomes can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: compare in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Synthetic wheat is another approach that's
taken specifically in wheat breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where a cross between a
tetraploid, durum or other tetraploid
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat is made to that D genome donor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This basically regenerates that initial
cross that resulted in hexafloid wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, a drawback of using this approach
is that you're essentially discarding many
[SPEAKER_02]: generations of breeding progress that has
been made in hexafloid wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these materials aren't generally very
adopted agronomically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene editing also has its place in
intergression breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really specific for precise edits.
[SPEAKER_02]: When thinking about just increasing
overall quantitative variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be a little more challenging and
it's also important to think about any
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of regulatory constraints that come
along with that process, especially in the
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and in working with wheat germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amplipoid hybrids are a really interesting
approach that can be taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: This allows for crossing between two
relatively unrelated species because when
[SPEAKER_02]: that cross is done, artificial chromosome
doubling is performed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, the complete chromosomal
constitution of each of the two species
[SPEAKER_02]: that were used in that cross is
maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the amphipoid hybrid approach was what
was used in development of my Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: research population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know this is a lot, but just go step
by step with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first step was through crossing the
hexaploid recurrent parent bread wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: donor to the H.
[SPEAKER_02]: lobstachii gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cross between these two species does not
have much match in terms of its
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosomes, which is why we had to double
the chromosomes with colchicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This resulted in development of the
synthetic octoploid, where we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: full genomic makeup of Acevon and the full
genomic makeup of H.
[SPEAKER_02]: lobstachii.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this way, this synthetic octoploid is
used as an amphipoid bridge to bring in
[SPEAKER_02]: the diversity coming from wild emmer or
triticum digocoides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that second step was using this
amphipoid bridge with a cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: digocoides.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, the hexaploids are able to be
regained.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's important to notice is
that in this F1 generation, we still have
[SPEAKER_02]: a really high contribution of theoretical
wild alleles in our background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to regain that background recurrent
parent, two VAP crosses were made to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same hexaploid recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where after the first VAP cross,
the theoretical proportion of wild alleles
[SPEAKER_02]: would be around 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the second, that's reduced down to
around 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, this population is
developed to have a very high proportion
[SPEAKER_02]: of that recurrent parent background in it
to maintain adequate levels of yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: regional adaptation, while still keeping
low level contributions from those wild
[SPEAKER_02]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also important that we keep those
integrations at a high enough frequency to
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can actually pick up on any
meaningful variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after these F4 derived F5 lines were
increased, we were able to do a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic trialing across Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used three years, three locations,
distributed across the precipitation
[SPEAKER_02]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's interesting that in the
three years that we did this study in,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of Kansas was under a pretty severe
drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the differences that we might observe
between these locations in a year with
[SPEAKER_02]: adequate precipitation were not
necessarily observed in my data.
[SPEAKER_02]: The largest piece of my project was
collecting this massive quantity of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go over each of these components in
the next several slides, but the goal was
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially to look at the trait means and
variances of those wild integration lines
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to common check varieties that
are used as benchmarks of regional
[SPEAKER_02]: performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I talk more about each of those
trait groups, I wanted to discuss my data
[SPEAKER_02]: processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is essentially a zoomed in view on
two of those 279 integration lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is shown here are my raw
observational data, why, for three traits,
[SPEAKER_02]: senescent state, plant height,
and grain yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you might notice is that these traits
have very different magnitudes of
[SPEAKER_02]: variance, so we're making efficient
comparisons between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can be really challenging, especially when
considering deviation between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I pursued a data
standardization approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fairly straightforward
methodology to where within each location,
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the within environment trait mean,
subtracted it from the raw data,
[SPEAKER_02]: and divided by the within environment
standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_02]: After doing this standardization process,
we're left with a data set that is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: more easily interpretable to where the
mean is going to be at zero, which means
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with a positive value is going to
be above the mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with a negative value will be
below the mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: This just becomes a really easy way to
view a lot of data at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: The standardized data we're used is the
input for two-stage analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first stage was modeling the within
location genotypic values as fixed
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, and we did this by making an AR1
row column spatial correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: After running this model, we had our blues
or genotypic estimates and our weights
[SPEAKER_02]: corresponding to each one of those values,
which were used as the input into the next
[SPEAKER_02]: model in a two-stage analysis,
which is a blup model.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is run across locations using
genotype as a random effect to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: can extract one single genotypic value for
each genotype across all locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing this enables a much more efficient
analysis because instead of doing single
[SPEAKER_02]: within environment analyses and trying to
composite across them, this essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: does that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: To further verify that this approach was a
reasonable one, I looked at the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: correlations of different traits and
traits within environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: The diagonal shown here or the matrix
shown here has genetic correlation of
[SPEAKER_02]: grain yield blues at the six locations
tested with genetic repeatability.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can be noticed is that the high
degree of correlation between these
[SPEAKER_02]: locations indicates that there aren't very
many rank changes in these genotypes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which allows me to make more efficient
comparisons just using those blups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect my results to apply
regardless of my location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at my trait blups in this matrix,
again with the genetic repeatability
[SPEAKER_02]: plotted on the diagonal, I specifically
want to highlight the fact that these
[SPEAKER_02]: repeatability values are moderately high
to high, which is not necessarily always
[SPEAKER_02]: expected for highly quantitative traits,
which is what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that those had high
repeatability values indicates that using
[SPEAKER_02]: these blups is going to be an effective
way to still capture that effective
[SPEAKER_02]: variation while not having to necessarily
do it within each environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going into some of these specific trait
groups, one of the first things I measured
[SPEAKER_02]: were some of my phenological
characteristics, so heading date,
[SPEAKER_02]: senescence date, grain fill period,
and plant height.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pattern that is interesting here to
notice is the divergence of the mean and
[SPEAKER_02]: standard deviation of the checks versus
the integration lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this orange bar corresponding to
the checks and the purple corresponding to
[SPEAKER_02]: the integration lines with the mean
centered at zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that these checks are on average
developing quite a bit later compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: the integration lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be localized to a region on
chromosome 2B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, I didn't have time to talk
too much about my marker data,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did want to show some of my GWAS
results just so you guys can see that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are still able to pick up variation coming
from these wild alleles even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they're at very low minor allele
frequencies, which is shown in this table
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to yield components,
something that is important when thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about working with wild materials is the
fact that we're going to see pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: significant yield drag.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are showing grain yield for the
checks, the integration lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that those checks are having a much
higher level of yield compared to those
[SPEAKER_02]: integration lines, although that pattern
doesn't necessarily follow throughout all
[SPEAKER_02]: of our different traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focusing first on our traits that are
related to the source stage of the yield
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle, we saw quite a bit of variation
to where I got some fairly strong peaks
[SPEAKER_02]: across all of these traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: A specific thing I want to point out here
is that for my green reflectance values,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that same peak on chromosome 2B.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fairly intuitive, however,
because previously when that peak was
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with maturity and development
to where something that is senescing is
[SPEAKER_02]: losing its green chlorophyll content.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you average that green reflectance
throughout the growing season,
[SPEAKER_02]: things with lower values are probably
going to be the ones that matured faster
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, making sense still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the sync-related traits,
we see that there was a common association
[SPEAKER_02]: for several of these grain size traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1000 kernel weight, test weight,
and kernel width.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, that association for test
weight, which is essentially how
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively your grain can pass back into
a certain volume, that has a fairly large
[SPEAKER_02]: effect and fairly large percent variance
explained to where the fact that this
[SPEAKER_02]: region came up for multiple grain size
traits indicates that this may have a
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly large effect on the yield drag that
is observed in these materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we see a drag for yield,
the opposite effect is generally observed
[SPEAKER_02]: for our quality traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons people use wild emmer
specifically in wheat breeding programs is
[SPEAKER_02]: because of its quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: When thinking about our grain protein
content, we see that these checks have an
[SPEAKER_02]: average of much lower compared to the wild
intergression lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, grain protein and grain yield in
wheat have a very strongly negative
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship to where it can be
challenging to select on both of these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to pick one,
then you're going to pick yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where breeders use a metric
called grain protein deviation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is essentially a regression of
protein content on grain yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the residuals from that regression
as the protein deviation values.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be used in a way to where a
cutoff threshold for grain yield can be
[SPEAKER_02]: established.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lines with higher than average
grain protein can be selected,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is shown in this green box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at the distribution of
grain protein deviation in my population,
[SPEAKER_02]: which essentially combines the protein and
yield, we see that those checks and the
[SPEAKER_02]: recurrent parent all kind of cluster at
the lower end of that distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these integration lines have higher
grain protein deviation overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that is interesting to
notice is that for protein quality score
[SPEAKER_02]: and solvent retention capacity,
which while grain protein is more a
[SPEAKER_02]: measure of protein content, these are a
measure of protein quality, those do not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we've brought an increase in
protein content over from these wild
[SPEAKER_02]: relative integrations, we did not
necessarily increase the functional
[SPEAKER_02]: protein quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also screened some of these through a
full ionomics panel of 19 elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't include these on the previous
correlation matrix, just because it would
[SPEAKER_02]: have been incredibly massive to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I showed these here, also including
grain yield and grain protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to point out is the generally
negative correlations between grain yield
[SPEAKER_02]: and these ionomics traits, meaning that
selection for increasing concentration of
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable elements in the grain may be
very likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reduce our grain yield levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, when looking at these
genetic repeat abilities, those low
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic repeat abilities indicate that
there's a lot of environmental variation
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to have an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the efficiency of selection won't
be that high anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these ionomics data are a little bit
messy in terms of how we can use them for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nonetheless, I was able to actually
find an interesting pathway which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: pursued to where for a rubidium,
which is shown here, I got that same peak
[SPEAKER_02]: on the same region of chromosome 2B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rubidium is generally used as a proxy
for potassium transport, which is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be water transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see variations in your
rubidium concentrations that are localized
[SPEAKER_02]: to the same regions as your development,
that can really be indicative of some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of a drought-related effect especially
given the fact that these data were all
[SPEAKER_02]: collected under drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be interesting to look
more at this region on chromosome 2B in
[SPEAKER_02]: greater detail under more controlled
drought environments instead of just the
[SPEAKER_02]: randomly natural drought that my
experiment was conducted under.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've shown you guys a bunch of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes my introgression lines did
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes my checks did better.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question that comes up is how on earth
are we going to use all this data?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where index selection becomes
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I am in an applied breeding
program, I'm still going to always be the
[SPEAKER_02]: most interested in grain yield,
which is why I developed this selection
[SPEAKER_02]: index specifically to always pick the
highest yielding things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I did this, and just a reminder
that these are standardized bluffs I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working with, I multiplied the bluff of
grain yield for a specific genotype by the
[SPEAKER_02]: bluff of another trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, grain fill period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected a subset of traits that I
thought captured what breeders are
[SPEAKER_02]: generally selecting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grain fill period, high yielding but
low short plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I divided by plant height here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my protein, my solvent retention
capacity, some of my kernel traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after doing these individual grain
yield by trait indices, I was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: average across them to come up with an
overall index for all of these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This index pulled out a couple
introgression lines that outperformed
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely everything in the population,
including the highest performing check,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is bolded to the showdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have this plotted next to grain
yield in bushels per acre for comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that while this selection
index is pulling out the things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: best across a wide range of traits,
it is specifically also pulling out the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are the highest yielding,
which is going to be incredibly important
[SPEAKER_02]: when thinking about developing breeding
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't necessarily trying to develop
germplasm to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were more thinking about developing
parents for our crossing block,
[SPEAKER_02]: which these materials are already being
recycled in our crossing block this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, these top three,
so those three are being pursued for
[SPEAKER_02]: germplasm release later this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a really positive result out
of my project because we weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily expecting that yield and
adaptation to come through from that
[SPEAKER_02]: recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, some of the most interesting
things that I have found out of my project
[SPEAKER_02]: is that using that amphipoid hybrid bridge
approach was pretty effective at bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: in diversity on all three genomes at a
level that was able to be detected by my
[SPEAKER_02]: different analyses while still maintaining
that recurrent parent background.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things are still very well adapted
to Kansas, even in spite of the drought
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions that was experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, there are several
interesting routes that can be pursued
[SPEAKER_02]: further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that region on chromosome 2b could
be really studied in a lot of detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the region on 6b, I think that would
be really interesting to look at in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of reducing that linkage drag that comes
from wild introgressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I just want to make sure
that nobody thinks that I did this all on
[SPEAKER_02]: my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give the biggest of thanks to
the K-State Weed Breeding Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've supported me through every single
stage of my research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, my graduate committee for
all their intellectual contributions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty stupid when I started,
so they've helped me become slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: smarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, my mentors, they've been the people
who have gone out of their way to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that I have had the one-on-one
support I've needed at any given point in
[SPEAKER_02]: my research, and of course, my family and
my funding sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, not sure how much time we
have left for questions, but you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: me during coffee, and thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can go first.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see any segregation distortion?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did check for one aneuploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not find any, because since these
are BC2s, that allows for a lot of that
[SPEAKER_02]: background to be brought back in to where
these were mostly the recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got access to the deep sequencing
data from my parents, so that's the last
[SPEAKER_02]: big piece of my project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll be doing introgression mapping
to more finely delineate where those
[SPEAKER_02]: introgression regions occur, so I can look
more at that segregation distortion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also expect those frequencies,
once I do that, to not necessarily match
[SPEAKER_02]: my Mendelian expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendelian expectations do not necessarily
apply when playing around with phoidy
[SPEAKER_02]: levels super well, so these are
approximate estimations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, there was some negative
selection that we did against things that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't thresh or that shattered before
harvest, so I might expect those to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher proportion of wild alleles in them,
which is why they were not adapted,
[SPEAKER_02]: and removing those would subsequently
lower my overall allele frequencies from
[SPEAKER_02]: those integrations, but if they can't run
through the combine, then there's no point
[SPEAKER_02]: in evaluating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just curious, you mentioned the
overall protein content and then the
[SPEAKER_10]: protein quality, and I was curious what
that meant, like quality in terms of
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrition or what were you looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the question is about protein
content versus protein quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a really breeders friendly low
or high throughput assay for early
[SPEAKER_02]: generation materials because it only
requires five grams of seed, and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lactic acid SDS SRC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically add lactic acid and SDS,
and we can do the dry pellet weight,
[SPEAKER_02]: wet pellet weight, and adjust that for
moisture to look at our solvent retention
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity, which gets at your gluten
strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are very well correlated to some of
our lower throughput bake analyses that
[SPEAKER_02]: are done on our very late generation
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then off the solvent retention
capacity, if you divide that value by the
[SPEAKER_02]: protein content, that gives you an
estimate of protein quality because
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has higher solvent
retention capacity but lower protein has
[SPEAKER_02]: more functional protein, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's a breeders assay that was
specifically developed for wheat breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you elaborate more on the ionomic
section?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you said you're using the rubium
levels to infer drought resistance,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So rubidium has a pretty high or strong
correlation to potassium, which when you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the potassium concentration in the
grain, that's going to be an indication of
[SPEAKER_02]: water movement throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rubidium is used as a proxy for
potassium transport because the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: they are seen in these assays is
relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to learn that from some little
deep dive in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did not necessarily know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we see things with elevated
rubidium levels, that can indicate that
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant is under higher levels of
drought stress because if there's more
[SPEAKER_02]: rubidium, that means there's going to be
more water transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of where we're going
with this association right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will, of course, be better verified
with my deep sequencing data and any other
[SPEAKER_02]: analyses that are done on this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw a hand over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a bit more anecdotal and maybe
far out of the distributionary research.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I noticed in some of my work that I
looked at chloroplasts and the chloroplast
[SPEAKER_09]: genome for a lot of agelop species and
scantrinicum is drastically different and
[SPEAKER_09]: drastically shorter than others.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was curious, when you're doing your
crossing, did you observe anything weird
[SPEAKER_09]: happening based on cytoplasmic
inheritance?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you had agelops as the maternal of
the female parent, the cross versus not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's a good point, is that when
crossing with these wild relatives,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be really hard to use the wild
relative as a female parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the wild relative as the pollen
donor in all cases because especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: agelops talgii, those are some really
small anthers, it's going to be hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: pull those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we did use the recurrent,
whatever had the recurrent parent in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was always our female donor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't specifically look at maternal
versus maternal inheritance, but that
[SPEAKER_02]: would definitely be interesting to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to ask, what has been your
greatest challenge in this research and
[SPEAKER_13]: also what is the thing that you're most
excited or passionate about?
[SPEAKER_13]: Most excited about is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were really, really not expecting these
things to look very good in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not super drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned that drought escape strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily desirable because
that's going to shorten the grain filling
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that we were able to get
upwards of 80 bushels an acre grain yield
[SPEAKER_02]: off of these materials was a really
encouraging result, especially because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's simultaneous research that's going
on along side at the USDA in Manhattan,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kansas, using EMR in direct crosses to
where when making comparisons between
[SPEAKER_02]: things using the direct crossing approach
and the amphipoid bridge approach,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a significant difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where we really like the integration
strategy we used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say the most challenging
thing, I think that there are not a wide
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of resources to train graduate
students in breeding analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the kind of some of the technical
aspects, it's hard to get exposure to both
[SPEAKER_02]: the practical and the theoretical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to bring those two
things together and kind of think at every
[SPEAKER_02]: stage of the process, what might be going
on and thinking of a plant as a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: system and not just puzzle pieces,
but all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can list a million things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for one more question,
but then we will come back here at 325 for
[SPEAKER_09]: Samantha's talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy the coffee, everybody, and give it
up for Addy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Potentially speciation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're thinking about these
processes happening at an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_12]: time scale.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're thinking hundreds to millions of
generations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have these kind of three main
processes, mutation, selection,
[SPEAKER_12]: and drift that are really big shapers of
this genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_12]: But sometimes there can be these
hybridization events between two species
[SPEAKER_12]: where instead of getting half of a
genome's worth of DNA from each parent,
[SPEAKER_12]: you get the full genome from mom and the
full genome from dad.
[SPEAKER_12]: So instead of one and one making two,
you get two and two making four or a
[SPEAKER_12]: tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_12]: And over these evolutionary times,
we can see this DNA sequences are being
[SPEAKER_12]: lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this process is called diplodization,
where that polyploid species becomes
[SPEAKER_12]: something like a diploid again.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this process of sequence lost is
called fractionation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And while DNA sequence loss is a major
consequence of polyploidy and basically
[SPEAKER_12]: the response to this event, there can be
other changes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Including changes to gene expression or
changes to existing gene functions to
[SPEAKER_12]: change slightly that gene function or even
develop novel functions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not just the genes that are
duplicating in these events.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are affecting all of the other
genomic elements, including repeat space,
[SPEAKER_12]: like transposable elements, and also all
those regulators that are affecting gene
[SPEAKER_12]: expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we have these whole genome
duplication events, we are generating this
[SPEAKER_12]: massive pool of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a huge pool of adaptive
potential.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this process of fractionation whittles
that pool down.
[SPEAKER_12]: But during this process, we can also see
these bursts of diversification where
[SPEAKER_12]: there are many more forms of species,
either forms of the same species or even
[SPEAKER_12]: whole new species.
[SPEAKER_12]: Forming that could be adapted to different
environments compared to that parental
[SPEAKER_12]: species.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in this way, polyploidy and
fractionation are major shapers of genomic
[SPEAKER_12]: diversity and structure, potentially
leading to these novel forms.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're probably asking yourself,
well, Sam, how common is this actually?
[SPEAKER_12]: This seems like this would be a pretty
rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_12]: But actually, polyploidy is very common.
[SPEAKER_12]: Particularly in plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so here, this is a wonderful kind of
mini review about it, where they made a
[SPEAKER_12]: phylogeny using all the plant emojis
available to you on your emoji keyboard.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they put all of the whole genome
duplication events that we have observed
[SPEAKER_12]: as red dots and all the whole genome
triplication.
[SPEAKER_12]: So instead of being two, you have three.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now,
[SPEAKER_12]: if we have an estimate of what that genome
size was right here at the base of this
[SPEAKER_12]: phylogeny, either how many chromosomes was
in that original genome or how much DNA as
[SPEAKER_12]: in picograms there was, we can then say,
OK, if you've been through so many rounds
[SPEAKER_12]: of duplication, we can multiply that star
number of chromosomes and DNA weight to
[SPEAKER_12]: get an estimate of how big that genome
should be now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what's indicated here in yellow
with being chromosome numbers and blue
[SPEAKER_12]: being that genome size and just total DNA
mass.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the darker colors being bigger
genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what do we actually see?
[SPEAKER_12]: We see much smaller genomes and much fewer
chromosome numbers than we would expect
[SPEAKER_12]: here in those kind of inner circles that
are much lighter in color.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, personally, I find these color scales
really difficult to parse and compare.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'd rather show you this histogram
instead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we have a genome size right in
picograms on this x-axis for thousands of
[SPEAKER_12]: angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the high edge of this histogram,
while there is a long tail at much larger
[SPEAKER_12]: genome sizes, the edge of this histogram
is at 30 picograms, which is about where
[SPEAKER_12]: the arrow is pointing to on the original
scale.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as you can see, we're not even getting
into those darker colors.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all these basically gradations of
bright, bright blue.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So all of these small genomes have to be
due to these really large amounts of DNA
[SPEAKER_12]: sequence loss over time, given all of
these polyploidy events.
[SPEAKER_12]: And since in this talk, I really want to
focus in on this process of fractionation,
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to reiterate this with a simplified
cartoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so here, this cartoon is really nice
in that we have a red genome and a blue
[SPEAKER_12]: genome that come together to form a
polyploid that has six chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: three from blue, three from red.
[SPEAKER_12]: And over time, we see sequence loss where
maybe those chromosomes start to shrink in
[SPEAKER_12]: size.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe over some more time,
some of those chromosomes start to fuse
[SPEAKER_12]: together.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we see a reduction in overall
chromosome number.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe over really, really large time
scales, we see something that looks like a
[SPEAKER_12]: diploid, or has been re-diplodized,
and we're back down to a chromosome number
[SPEAKER_12]: of three.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is a really nice, simple
cartoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as a biologist, when I am coming up to
this species at the end of this cycle,
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see red and blue.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just see something that looks like a
diploid with three chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the only way we can see this
history of duplication to parse apart
[SPEAKER_12]: those red and blue chromosome segments is
by aligning these quote unquote purple
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosomes to either the red or the blue
genome, or something that's very similar
[SPEAKER_12]: to one of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what do I mean by an alignment?
[SPEAKER_12]: So here, we have this ancestral species.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now each of these colored triangles
represents a gene.
[SPEAKER_12]: And given some time, we might see
speciation giving us these two descendant
[SPEAKER_12]: species.
[SPEAKER_12]: Genes that arise from that same common
ancestor, so the red triangles here,
[SPEAKER_12]: we call these orthologs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we see all of these orthologs
conserved in the same order and
[SPEAKER_12]: orientation, we call that synteny,
this conserved gene order.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, over time, structural variants such
as inversions or insertion and deletion
[SPEAKER_12]: events can break up this synteny,
making it harder to see these conserved
[SPEAKER_12]: pieces of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you see bow ties in some future
slides, know that that's due to these
[SPEAKER_12]: inversions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now let's add in some polyplity on top
of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say one of those species suddenly
has a whole genome duplication event,
[SPEAKER_12]: and now there's two of everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Each copy of that genome is called a
subgenome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, we're using subgenome one and two.
[SPEAKER_12]: And each one of those genes arising from
that duplication event, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're pairs from that same ortholog.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are called homeologs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when now we do these alignments with
this now polyploid species back to the
[SPEAKER_12]: species that's remained diploid,
we should see a two to one ratio of
[SPEAKER_12]: synteny, where for each part of that
reference diploid, we see two pieces
[SPEAKER_12]: matching in that polyploid genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I've been showing you a lot of
cartoons.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's start adding in some real data on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I study the Trypsicinae, which is this
sub-tribe of grasses in the
[SPEAKER_12]: Anthropogoniae.
[SPEAKER_12]: It includes two genera.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is Trypsicum, which is a wild grass
that grows kind of more in the United
[SPEAKER_12]: States and in more northern regions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have the genus Zia,
which is mostly centered in Mexico and
[SPEAKER_12]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's made up of a number of wild
species, mostly annual, as well as our
[SPEAKER_12]: domesticate maize.
[SPEAKER_12]: And since maize is a very important
cultural and economic crop, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of genomic resources, including 26 genome
assemblies that are chromosome level and
[SPEAKER_12]: cover a wide range of diversity,
including tropical, and temperate
[SPEAKER_12]: material, sweet corns, popcorns,
field corns.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good encompassing of maize
diversity.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know that it had a whole genome
duplication event about 5 to 12 million
[SPEAKER_12]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know this because sorghum,
which has remained diploid over that time,
[SPEAKER_12]: we see a two to one relationship when we
align these genomes to sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know this is a complicated figure.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to walk through it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So along that x-axis, we have our sorghum
chromosomes lined up 1 through 10.
[SPEAKER_12]: And on that y-axis, we have the maize
chromosomes lined up also 1 through 10.
[SPEAKER_12]: And each of those circles are representing
areas of synteny that had been identified.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we look at sorghum chromosome
1, we see that there's a full copy of it,
[SPEAKER_12]: essentially, in the maize chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also see a second copy of that sorghum
chromosome 1 split up across the maize
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosome 5 and the maize chromosome 9.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we see this expected two to one
relationship that tells us that this was
[SPEAKER_12]: an ancient polyploid at some point.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So because we have all of these many
chromosome level assemblies for maize,
[SPEAKER_12]: we've been able to study what's happened
to these subgenomes over time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for instance, we know that one of
those subgenomes, the maize 1 subgenome,
[SPEAKER_12]: has been preferentially retained while the
other one has been preferentially lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is likely due to functionality
differences.
[SPEAKER_12]: Genes on the M1 subgenome are more
strongly expressed and are likely
[SPEAKER_12]: contributing more to traits than the M2
genes.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also know that fractionation is
ongoing, meaning that if you were to take
[SPEAKER_12]: two maize lines and you look at a
particular pair of homologs or genes,
[SPEAKER_12]: you might see in one line that both are
retained or one or the other is retained
[SPEAKER_12]: or both copies are deleted.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you might see a different outcome in
that other maize line, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_12]: fractionation is not something that
happened just long ago, but is happening
[SPEAKER_12]: also today.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm telling you about all of this
because there was this recent project
[SPEAKER_12]: called the Pan-Androberganiae Project that
did a lot of genome assembly, not just in
[SPEAKER_12]: this sub-tribe, but across the entire
tribe of the Androberganiae, which is kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of warm season grasses.
[SPEAKER_12]: And among these, genomes that were
assembled included a Androberganiae
[SPEAKER_12]: reginicus, which is a sister species to
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's wild, but it has also remained
diploid during this time frame.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it can be used as a reference
outgroup along with sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have two new trypsicum genomes
that are homosome level, as well as
[SPEAKER_12]: multiple wild Zia genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can combine all of these wild
genomes with our maize genomes and thus
[SPEAKER_12]: get an unprecedented number of assemblies
representing descendants from the same
[SPEAKER_12]: whole genome duplication event.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to reiterate this point because all
of the information that we have kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: come to conclude about polyploids,
we have done through studying polyploids
[SPEAKER_12]: from different whole genome duplication
events and comparing across them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas this one is the same event,
but all of these descendants have
[SPEAKER_12]: experienced just this one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is really, really exciting because
it allows us to ask two big questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: One, how repeatable is fractionation
across all of these lineages, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the exact same event.
[SPEAKER_12]: How similar are their responses to it?
[SPEAKER_12]: And two, we can start to ask questions
about when does fractionation really occur
[SPEAKER_12]: relative to these species diverging from
each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're going to focus on this first
question first.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I told you that these are chromosome
level assemblies, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're some of the first for
trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we were curious about how conserved
that synteny is between sorghum and
[SPEAKER_12]: trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so important to understand,
trypsicum has 18 chromosomes and that
[SPEAKER_12]: ancestral polyploid probably had 20.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's not been a huge reduction in
chromosome number, only losing two
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we compare it to sorghum,
each of these ribbons are colored to each
[SPEAKER_12]: of the 10 sorghum chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And each ribbon represents synteny between
sorghum and the trypsicum genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully what you can see is that for
each sorghum genome, chromosome,
[SPEAKER_12]: I should say, excuse me, you see two
trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Only a couple where those chromosomes have
been mashed together to have that
[SPEAKER_12]: reduction to 18 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we see this massive conservation of
chromosome structure between trypsicum and
[SPEAKER_12]: its ancestral polyploid.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Zia?
[SPEAKER_12]: How is that different, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we look at Zia, we're looking at
10 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is very different from trypsicums.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's been this massive reduction in
chromosome number.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the way we get that is because when we
compare to sorghum, each maze chromosome
[SPEAKER_12]: is basically a mosaic of many sorghum
chromosomes that have been mashed
[SPEAKER_12]: together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we see these huge chromosomal
rearrangements relative to sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you might be asking yourself,
Sam, you said you had over 30 genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're only showing me two.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about all those other ones?
[SPEAKER_12]: How does synteny to sorghum compare within
and across these genera?
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the bottom are our two reference
genome sorghum and anthropogum virginicus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're strongly syntenic to each
other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And likewise, our two trypsicum genomes
are strongly syntenic to each other as
[SPEAKER_12]: they are to both of our reference
outgroups.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the top is that maze.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's reference genome B73.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to start adding in some
genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start with our wild Zia species,
diplopornis and nicaraguensis.
[SPEAKER_12]: We see that they show lots of chromosomal
rearrangements relative to sorghum,
[SPEAKER_12]: but are strongly syntenic to each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we add in the wild relatives that
are subspecies of Zia mazes, such as
[SPEAKER_12]: Parvaglumus, Mexicana, and Weiwei
tenensis, we can see that there are some
[SPEAKER_12]: inversions, which are those bow ties.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we still see that synteny is strongly
conserved across Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can add in the rest of our
domesticated maze genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully you can see it's a pretty
consistent band of color across all of
[SPEAKER_12]: these genomes, indicating that we have
really strong conservation of synteny
[SPEAKER_12]: within genera, but very different between
genera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I also told you that this was part of
a larger data set, and I would be remiss
[SPEAKER_12]: if I didn't talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this larger data set is looking at
the whole Antberganiae.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Michelle Stitzer, who's here in the
front row, has been looking at what kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of has happened tribe-wide.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we have been focusing on this one
whole genome duplication event.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when we look across the Antberganiae,
there have been many other polyploidy
[SPEAKER_12]: events.
[SPEAKER_12]: And here I'm just highlighting in red the
whole genome duplication events.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we look at the synteny to there,
sorry, guys, what you should be seeing is
[SPEAKER_12]: there is huge, huge ribbons of color
coming down between each of these
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, there's been some file formatting
struggles.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what you should see is this kind of
very conserved chromosomal structure
[SPEAKER_12]: across all of these genomes, indicating
that they look a lot like what we see in
[SPEAKER_12]: trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another way of saying that is that Zia is
an outlier, at least in an observational
sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: If not a statistical sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know this isn't particularly
convincing of that point.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can absolutely convince yourself
by looking at that QR code, which is the
[SPEAKER_12]: pre-print for the Panantberganiae paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: So please check out that pre-print.
[SPEAKER_12]: And believe me when I tell you that that's
what it shows.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's focus back down into our whole
genome duplication event in Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: And here we're really focusing on these
potential outcomes for pairs of genes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Either they are completely retained as
duplicates within a genome, or one or the
[SPEAKER_12]: other have been lost, or both are lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we identify these fractionation events
by looking for deletions within the x on
[SPEAKER_12]: of genes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first thing we have to do is align
our genomes to sorghum to identify where
[SPEAKER_12]: deletions have happened in our Zia and
trypsicum genomes versus sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also know that one of those homeologs
should be in the M1 subgenome,
[SPEAKER_12]: and the other should be in the M2
subgenome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can figure out which is which using
orthology and synteny.
[SPEAKER_12]: We then need to combine this information
so we know which homeologs had which
[SPEAKER_12]: deletions across each genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, making sure that we're
comparing blues to blues and reds to reds
[SPEAKER_12]: across all of these genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking at about 12,000 genes
because while all our Zia and trypsicum
[SPEAKER_12]: genomes have been undergoing
fractionation, sorghum has been evolving,
[SPEAKER_12]: too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not necessarily exactly what it was
12 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we use that other reference
outgroup, Iandropogon virginicus,
[SPEAKER_12]: to come up with these gene models that
have the same number of exons across both
[SPEAKER_12]: of our reference genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those exons have the same length,
basically saying we think that these gene
[SPEAKER_12]: models are probably highly conserved and
are more likely to be representative of
[SPEAKER_12]: what we would have seen in that polyploid
12 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so these represent about 69,000 exons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so just across genomes, when we're
thinking about how much of M1 and M2 have
[SPEAKER_12]: been retained versus lost, we see that M1
is preferentially retained almost 60% to
[SPEAKER_12]: 40%.
[SPEAKER_12]: And M2 is preferentially lost in about the
same kind of the reverse proportions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Suggesting that M1 has been preferentially
retained across all of these genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's exactly what we see when we now
look at pairs of exons across each of
[SPEAKER_12]: these genomes, where if one of those exons
is lost in a genome, more often than not,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's the M1 that sticks around and it's
the M2 that's lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you might also be looking at that
section of where we see pairs of exons
[SPEAKER_12]: retained, that both retained.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you might notice that our pink dots,
which represent our trypsicum genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: have a much higher percentage of exons
observed in that both retained category.
[SPEAKER_12]: This suggests that trypsicum has retained
more pairs of exons and thus has had less
[SPEAKER_12]: fractionation or loss of DNA than Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, we've been talking about exons,
but a lot of people think we really want
[SPEAKER_12]: to know what's happening at the gene
level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we can think about, on average,
how many exons from a homeolog have been
[SPEAKER_12]: lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can break this down to percentages
because now all genes have the same number
[SPEAKER_12]: of exons, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep it standard.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so here in black, we have this
reference gene model for three exons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can think about if one,
two, or all three have been lost,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: You would see 33, 66, and 100%.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so across each of these genomes,
what we find in both M1 and M2,
[SPEAKER_12]: the majority of these homeologs have been
completely lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no exons left.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a bump where only maybe a little
bit of the homeolog has been deleted in
[SPEAKER_12]: M1.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the most part, we see that the
entire gene has been deleted.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which brings us to this perhaps
philosophical question of at what point do
[SPEAKER_12]: we consider a gene to be fractionated?
[SPEAKER_12]: How much do you have to lose before you're
no longer a gene, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't have a satisfactory answer for
you to that particular question,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I did try some different cutoffs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to show you the most
extreme, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so at the most liberal cutoff,
we consider a gene to be fractionated if
[SPEAKER_12]: even a single exon in that gene has been
fractionated.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if all the other ones are retained,
only one is lost, then the entire gene is
[SPEAKER_12]: considered lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you would expect, under this very
liberal definition, the majority of our
[SPEAKER_12]: exons are considered lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do see a handful of genes that are
completely retained, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning they still have all of their exons
available to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the kind of opposite extreme,
where every exon in that gene has been has
[SPEAKER_12]: to be lost for that gene to be considered
fractionated.
[SPEAKER_12]: We see, right, there is this bump in terms
of the number of genes that are considered
[SPEAKER_12]: retained under this very strict
definition.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we still see a strong amount of genes
that are completely lost, meaning there's
[SPEAKER_12]: no exons left of them in these genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So kind of the big thing that you should
take away from this particular slide about
[SPEAKER_12]: genes is that whole gene loss is a heck of
a lot more common than whole gene
[SPEAKER_12]: retention.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this got me wondering, if an exon or a
gene starts off on one particular
[SPEAKER_12]: ancestral chromosome instead of another
chromosome, how often is the outcome of
[SPEAKER_12]: that fractionation different?
[SPEAKER_12]: So are you more likely to be retained if
you're, say, on chromosome 1 than if
[SPEAKER_12]: you're on a different original chromosome
from, here, sorghum?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what I'm showing you here is for
exons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we take the percentage of exons found
on that reference chromosome in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we say, how many of those exons are
considered both retained across our
[SPEAKER_12]: genomes?
[SPEAKER_12]: And what you can see is that if you're on
sorghum chromosome 1, you are actually
[SPEAKER_12]: much more likely to be observed as being
both retained than any other chromosome,
[SPEAKER_12]: particularly sorghum chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's actually a difference in
terms of how often genes are fractionated
[SPEAKER_12]: based off of, it seems, which chromosome
they originate from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we can see that this is true across
many other of our genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are fractionation categories.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's a large variation between
ancestral chromosomes, which brings us to
[SPEAKER_12]: the big question, why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do we see a difference?
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I don't have a particularly
satisfactory answer to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do have a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my hypothesis has to do with what
happened to those ancestral chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we're looking at the synteny of
sorghum chromosome 1 versus sorghum
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosome 5, we can see that across both
subgenomes, chromosome 1 in sorghum has
[SPEAKER_12]: been retained in pretty large chunks.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not very broken up, even in Zia,
where there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: rearrangements.
[SPEAKER_12]: But chromosome 5 from sorghum is really
sliced and diced.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in really small little bits and
pieces.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you make those dot thoughts for
synteny, it looks like confetti.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're so broken.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think there might be this
connection between rearrangement histories
[SPEAKER_12]: of these ancestral chromosomes and the
amount of fractionation that we observe
[SPEAKER_12]: today.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to summarize our answers to this first
question, what we find is that all
[SPEAKER_12]: lineages do show this biased retention of
the M1 subgenome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that fractionation tends to affect all
of the exons within a gene.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that trypsicum retains many more
homeolog pairs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Than Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that this perhaps might be due to
different chromosomal rearrangement
[SPEAKER_12]: histories.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this brings us to our second question.
[SPEAKER_12]: When did these differences start?
[SPEAKER_12]: And when did all of this start to happen?
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can look at this in a number of
ways.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first way I want to talk about is
parsimony.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is this idea that the simplest
solution is likely the correct one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we were to take our observed states
of retained versus lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could only put that fractionation
event in one spot on the tree,
[SPEAKER_12]: where would the spot be that gives us this
observed pattern?
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the blue case, we only see
fractionation of an exon in a single
[SPEAKER_12]: species.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it must have happened much more
recently after that species diverged from
[SPEAKER_12]: the others.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas with the red copy, we see that
that fractionation event is found in two
[SPEAKER_12]: of our genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it must have happened earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Before those species diverged from each
other.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're only using exons here that
have a definitive fractionation or
[SPEAKER_12]: retention call across every genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not using the full 69,000 exons
for this analysis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But those that we do use, about 80% across
both M1 and M2, are completely retained or
[SPEAKER_12]: completely lost across every genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: This suggests that the majority of
fractionation must have happened earlier,
[SPEAKER_12]: before the divergence of Trypsicum and
Zia, about a little over half a million
[SPEAKER_12]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And about 10% of those exons can't be
mapped to a single point on the tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning that you'd have to put down
multiple fractionation events to get to
[SPEAKER_12]: that observed pattern.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're grouping all of those
instances under this term paraphyly.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're doing your math,
you might be asking me, what about the
[SPEAKER_12]: other 10%?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as we look at those exons that are
fractionated across all of Zia,
[SPEAKER_12]: but retained in both of our Trypsicum
genomes, we see that about 4% of exons fit
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we can look at that description.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the reverse, exons that have been
lost across both of our Trypsicum genomes
[SPEAKER_12]: and retained across all of the Zia
genomes, is only about 1%.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is more evidence that Trypsicum has
experienced less fractionation than Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that this is likely due to increased
fractionation in Zia after they start to
[SPEAKER_12]: diverge from each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: So after that speciations event.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that leaves us with the last 5% of
exons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is divided into smaller and
smaller increments, where the exon is
[SPEAKER_12]: fractionated in either a handful of lines
or even just a single individual genome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And while these percentages are low,
it does mean that recent fractionation was
[SPEAKER_12]: detected across all lineages, and thus
fractionation at these exons could be
[SPEAKER_12]: different across genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which gives us to this question of how do
you even measure that?
[SPEAKER_12]: And gets us to this term of differential
fractionation, which is just a way to
[SPEAKER_12]: capture how different is fractionation for
a given locus across these genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when things aren't different at all,
where every single genome has the exact
[SPEAKER_12]: same status for an exon, we can say it has
one status, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: No differential fractionation.
[SPEAKER_12]: But perhaps, maybe when we look across all
genomes, we see two of these potential
[SPEAKER_12]: statuses.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is a little bit of differential
fractionation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can add and add until we see all
four statuses across our genomes would be
[SPEAKER_12]: the most differential fractionation that
you could possibly observe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is what I mean by one,
two, three, and four statuses.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so here, we have those statuses going
from no differential fractionation there
[SPEAKER_12]: at one to the most differential
fractionation that you could observe at
[SPEAKER_12]: four.
[SPEAKER_12]: And each black point is the percentage of
exons that we see for that particular
[SPEAKER_12]: number of statuses across all of our
genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the majority of our exons only show
one fractionation pattern indicating that
it does.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's all shared, which we had just
seen in our previous analyses.
[SPEAKER_12]: But about 35% of these exon pairs show
some differential fractionation across
[SPEAKER_12]: genomes, which is pretty stunning.
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't expecting that at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're expecting things to be very similar
across these genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, we've been talking about exons
and everyone wants to know what's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening at the gene level.
[SPEAKER_12]: So here, I have an example of some real
data.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have this sorghum gene that has 13
exons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've made a representative of the M1
homeolog across a few of our genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: where you can see perhaps in the
trypsicum, we see many of these exons are
[SPEAKER_12]: retained, but exon one and 10 are lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we look across Darzia,
we see a lot more exons are gone and just
[SPEAKER_12]: a few are retained, if any at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as you're looking at this,
you might be wondering, how do you even
[SPEAKER_12]: begin to summarize comparisons across the
sharing and differences of fractionation
[SPEAKER_12]: and retention across all of these
different genomes?
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, we've got about 30 plus genomes
and 12,000 genes to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I've come up with this particular
system.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where you can have these three levels
where fractionation has occurred and two
[SPEAKER_12]: genomes that you're comparing.
[SPEAKER_12]: If that fractionation is completely
shared, the exact same exons are lost
[SPEAKER_12]: across both genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: We call that complete sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas if only some of those exons have
been fractionated in both genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's just some.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if some exons are fractionated in each
genome, but they're completely different
[SPEAKER_12]: exons that are lost, there's no overlap in
which genes or which exons are lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's no sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can then also add in the layer of how
closely related are the two genomes that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're comparing, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they're the most closely related,
they're accessions of the same species,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the other end of the spectrum,
we would be comparing a genome from
[SPEAKER_12]: trypsicum versus a genome in Zia.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the middle, we'd have some
comparison of genomes that aren't the same
[SPEAKER_12]: species, but are in the same genus,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are comparisons within our Zia
subspecies and species.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I go through this to help us
understand this particular box plot
[SPEAKER_12]: because there's a lot of information here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we are looking at homeologues
where there's fractionation occurring in
[SPEAKER_12]: both, but that fractionation is completely
shared in the light pink and light green.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the top here, we see that there's the
greatest amount of sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these represent comparisons between
genomes that are closely related,
[SPEAKER_12]: accessions of the same species.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we look at kind of more diverged
genomes, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Comparisons between a trypsicum and a Zia
genome, we see less complete sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we look at more differential
sharing of fractionation or less sharing,
[SPEAKER_12]: we see that those more diverged genomes,
so our trypsicum versus Zia genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: are much more prevalent in these
categories where there's less and less
[SPEAKER_12]: sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also note that it's very, very rare that
none of the fractionation is shared at
[SPEAKER_12]: all, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Most often when we see fractionation
between these two genomes that we're
[SPEAKER_12]: comparing, there's at least some overlap
in which exons are lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, whenever we see patterns that are
either shared or different across
[SPEAKER_12]: lineages, we wanna know why.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is there sharing and why might there
be differences?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this naturally comes to the
question of selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: And DNDES is a way of measuring selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: So on this scale, we have DNDES of zero
refers to purifying selection,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is the removal of bad alleles from a
population.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at one or much greater than one DNDES,
that would be positive selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: So promotion or keeping around really good
alleles in a population.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if differences or changes between two
genomes, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: If those have a DNDES of one, that means
that those changes are neutral,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not under selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: They might not have a functional or a
fitness effect, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so any changes that we see there is
likely due to random changes, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Random drift.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we look at those genes that
show complete sharing between a focal
[SPEAKER_12]: genome and any other genome, we see that
the majority of the DNDES values that we
[SPEAKER_12]: have for those genes are centered on zero,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning that they're under purifying
selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: So selection is acting to remove
deleterious variants.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as we look at genes where they have
less than zero, less than less sharing
[SPEAKER_12]: between genomes, we see that that
distribution moves further away from zero
[SPEAKER_12]: and closer to one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning that they are more likely under
weakened or relaxed purifying selection or
[SPEAKER_12]: are becoming more neutral and thus
affected by more random changes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what does all of this even mean in
terms of when fractionation occurs,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So big picture.
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of fractionation is shared,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Across all of these genomes, suggesting
that it happened before these species
[SPEAKER_12]: began to diverge.
[SPEAKER_12]: So long, long ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we do see a large proportion of
exons that show differential
[SPEAKER_12]: fractionation, meaning that fractionation
is indeed ongoing and at larger scales
[SPEAKER_12]: than perhaps we expected.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that sharing a fractionation on a gene
by gene basis seems to be correlated with
[SPEAKER_12]: related effectiveness with more related
genomes sharing more of the fractionation
[SPEAKER_12]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that any differences that we see are
likely being driven by relaxed purifying
[SPEAKER_12]: selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I know that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so some big takeaways from this study
is that fractionation is much more dynamic
[SPEAKER_12]: as a process than we really expected to
see.
[SPEAKER_12]: While the majority of fractionation was
just shared across all of these genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: including the bias retention of M1 over M2
homeologues and the loss of entire
[SPEAKER_12]: homeologues.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do see these strong differences between
members of the trypsicum genus and members
[SPEAKER_12]: of the ZEA genus, which we did not expect
at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't emphasize that enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: We really expected that all of these
lineages that descended from the same
[SPEAKER_12]: whole genome duplication event would be
very similar to each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we hypothesize that these strong
differences might be related to different
[SPEAKER_12]: chromosomal rearrangement histories
between these two.
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, differences in these
fractionation between genomes are probably
[SPEAKER_12]: likely driven by drift, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And are correlated with relatedness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's usually at about this point in
any talk I give on this subject that
[SPEAKER_12]: somebody asks this question.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about sub and neo-functionalization?
[SPEAKER_12]: And you might be saying, Sam, those are
some really big new words.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you use those in your talk?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did not.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we really focused on retention
versus fractionation as the potential
[SPEAKER_12]: outcomes of this downsizing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But actually, there are many outcomes for
duplicate genes after a polyploidy event.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be sub-functionalized,
which is where that original function of
[SPEAKER_12]: that gene is split across these two
copies, either by each copy taking part of
[SPEAKER_12]: the original job or by becoming tissue
specific.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one gene is used for that job in
specific tissues and the other gene is
[SPEAKER_12]: used in different tissues.
[SPEAKER_12]: They could also become neo-functionalized,
which is where one copy retains that
[SPEAKER_12]: original function and the other copy is
allowed to mutate and generate new
[SPEAKER_12]: sequence and basically create a new novel
function.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're also really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're really difficult to prove and
require a lot of molecular work to
[SPEAKER_12]: validate them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I chose not to investigate them in
this study.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not to say that these aren't
necessarily happening in these genomes,
[SPEAKER_12]: just to say that they would be really hard
to study.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do have a really great example of
neo-functionalization where they did do
[SPEAKER_12]: that kind of validating work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're excited about that,
this was an instance of sodium ion
[SPEAKER_12]: channels that were duplicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: After a whole genome duplication event in
fish and one of those copies of that
[SPEAKER_12]: sodium ion channel, neo-functionalized to
basically become an electric sensory organ
[SPEAKER_12]: in fish.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're interested in that,
I highly recommend reading that paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not just maze, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're plant biologists.
[SPEAKER_12]: We like to think about all of the other
many diverse species available to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we can take away from this
beyond just what it means for maze and its
[SPEAKER_12]: wild relatives is that polyploidy and
fractionation have shaped every plant
[SPEAKER_12]: genome through these multiple rounds of
expansion and downsizing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so a fractionation is much more
dynamic between descendants of the same
[SPEAKER_12]: event than we previously expected.
[SPEAKER_12]: What does that mean for all of our other
polyploidy events and all of the
[SPEAKER_12]: descendants from those?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we see this connection between
chromosome stability and fractionation
[SPEAKER_12]: when we look across all these other
polyploids?
[SPEAKER_12]: What might make chromosomes more stable
than others?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how we haven't even touched life
history or some of these other kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: biological factors that might influence
these processes occurring at the genome
[SPEAKER_12]: level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so since this is a plant breeding
symposium, I wanted to have this one
[SPEAKER_12]: takeaway slide of what does this study add
to plant breeding?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so hopefully through this talk,
you've gained an appreciation for how
[SPEAKER_12]: fundamental these processes are for
generating the diversity and structure of
[SPEAKER_12]: modern plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that while many outcomes of these
processes are shared across lineages,
[SPEAKER_12]: descendants of the same whole genome
duplication event may have very different
[SPEAKER_12]: outcomes in terms of what diversity is
kept or lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, that these processes develop
novel, potentially adaptive variation
[SPEAKER_12]: beyond what was available in those
parental species.
[SPEAKER_12]: With that, I would like to thank all of my
funding agencies, mainly NSF, who have
[SPEAKER_12]: supported this work.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of my wonderful co-authors and lab
mates, my PhD committee members,
[SPEAKER_12]: and the practical haplotype graph team for
their help and support in completing this
[SPEAKER_12]: work.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also be remiss as a postdoc not to
mention that I'm working on a completely
[SPEAKER_12]: new project with my advisors, Jeff
Rossibara and Graham Cooper at UC Davis,
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at human domestication of maize as
a biocultural co-evolution.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to discuss this project more
with folks during the social hour later.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just wanted to mention that that's
what I'm working on currently.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so with that, thank you so much for
your time and attention.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to take any of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are over time, but I'll take one
question.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to ask what your greatest
challenge is in this research?
[SPEAKER_13]: And what you're most excited or passionate
about?
[SPEAKER_12]: With this research?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the hardest part about this was
developing the methods, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to come up with a way to accurately
identify fractionation and that it be the
[SPEAKER_12]: same fractionation across each of these
genomes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was really challenging.
[SPEAKER_12]: To use these tools that might not have
been built for that particular purpose,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I use them for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I'm really excited about is just
the amazing diversity that we can study
[SPEAKER_12]: given all of these new genomes and genome
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much big data out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many cool questions that this
data allows us to address and answer from
[SPEAKER_12]: basic biology that we previously couldn't
really get at.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm really excited about the
opportunities that big data give us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: One last round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are approaching the end of the
symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank all the speakers for
taking their time to come all over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Ithaca and give these wonderful
presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really grateful to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for the audience, I'm grateful to
you for giving your presence here and
[SPEAKER_01]: making this symposium a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, I would also again like to thank
my planning committee members who have
[SPEAKER_01]: been a source of support to the symposium
and to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this, I would like to say that we
have a social hour outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this, we can end the symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
