[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to talk about gasoline and
more, and why we must replace fire in our
[SPEAKER_01]: energy system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give excerpts of a much
longer presentation, and hopefully I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to say what I need to say in my 15
minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another possible title for this is,
Firing Fire, Why We Need to Cool Down the
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy System.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to start us off with a
question about this block of graphite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And graphite is pure carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the main ingredient in pencil lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the slide there, I've got it in the
quarter, so you can see that it's two by
[SPEAKER_01]: two by six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to think about how it
compares to the amount of carbon in a
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a lot less?
[SPEAKER_01]: About the same, a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wasn't in such a hurry,
I'd do a show of hands on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to cut that out for the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many sort of descendant talks
that are all kind of interrelated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of this is also part of the talk,
Fear is Our Best Hope, Moving from Climate
[SPEAKER_01]: Anxiety to Climate Action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did want to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show of hands, is there a
climate emergency?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I can't see the participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just imagine that most of you
think that there is a climate emergency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing that is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another show of hands, are you now,
or have you ever been scared about climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm guessing most of the hands
go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a third question, third and final for
this set here, is should we be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: about our climate education and
communication efforts?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm guessing most of you raised
your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goals for today are to astonish you,
scare you, not leave you scared though,
[SPEAKER_01]: but give you courage and motivate you to
act and give you some tools for upping
[SPEAKER_01]: your climate teaching and action game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, as I said, I'm going to skip
ahead to the word of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word of the day is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the longer version of this
slideshow, I interspersed the white slides
[SPEAKER_01]: with black text, with black text,
with white text, which is strategy slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll share this presentation before
we're done today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to jump ahead again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So skip most of the strategy slides to
talk about one kind of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_01]: source, and that's gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to think a bit about a
gallon of gasoline Americans burn 376
[SPEAKER_01]: million gallons of gasoline on the average
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That data's from 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than a gallon per person per
day, which should make you say,
wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to throw around some big
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to take a brief interruption
to talk about scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's zero, there's a trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were in person, I'd have folks come
up and I would put zero on a post-it note
[SPEAKER_01]: on one corner of the front wall of the
room and a trillion on the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: the opposite corner of the front wall,
and have everybody come up with post-it
[SPEAKER_01]: notes with a billion on it and put it
where they think it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're virtual, I'll have you do that
online there, and hopefully very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very speedily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can take a moment and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the sake of time, I'm actually
just going to fly by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do that, and we'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at your responses perhaps in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's zero, there's a trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the correct answer is that everything
goes in the first one, one thousandth of
[SPEAKER_01]: that length of the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commonly named numbers that we talk
about pretty regularly, a thousand,
[SPEAKER_01]: a billion, a trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I skipped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand, a million, a billion,
and a trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of those is a thousand times
larger than the one before it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't generally get that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is responses to that from an
earlier online session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very typical responses there, spread
largely across the first two thirds of the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, of course, is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not understanding that has some
consequences for us to think about a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of issues with climate and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly think that if more people
understood scale, the world would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: much better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to understand scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strategies for working on that I'll
share quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking about, this is something that
somebody's, everybody is familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a thousand seconds is about 17
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand times a thousand, again,
is a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a million seconds is about 12 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go from a thousand to a
million, that's the change we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a thousand times a million seconds
brings us up to 32 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some people on this call who
are probably about a half a billion
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds old, since we've got some students
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am coming up on two billion seconds old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a trillion seconds is about 32,000
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to before the dawn of
civilization and agriculture by most
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Homo sapiens, us as a species have
been around for less than 10 trillion
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds, less than 320,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best guess right now is about
300,000 years for the dawn of Homo
[SPEAKER_01]: sapiens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an example of social math,
which I'm not going to linger on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a way of helping people
understand big and small numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to gasoline now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We burn again about 376 million gallons a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to think about where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a gallon of gas weighs a little over
six pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can maybe picture holding a three
quarter gallon, or a gallon of water
[SPEAKER_01]: that's three quarters full, because water
has a density about three quarters that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or gasoline rather, has a density of three
quarters that of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you fill up a jug three quarters
full, that'll give you a proxy for
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about that gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you use 10 gallons a week,
where does that 60 pounds go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in order to figure that out,
we need to know a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, we need to know that matter can
neither be created nor destroyed,
[SPEAKER_01]: only changed in form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to figure out what's going on
with it, of course, we need to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: gasoline is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complex mixture of hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on average, its chemical formula is
C8H18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we had more time, I prod you to
give me a name for that chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's octane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you get when you burn octane?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you get carbon dioxide and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to look at that in cartoon
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also note that I made this
presentation using Apple keynote,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I like their animations better
than PowerPoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going to run that combustion
reaction in a moment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are our oxygen molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our octane molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give it a spark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we end up with going from one octane
molecule and 12 and a half O2 molecules to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight carbon dioxide molecules and nine
water molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at those carbon dioxide
molecules, and there are the water
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at those eight carbon
dioxide molecules and compare it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: octane molecule we started with,
we can see that the CO2 weighs a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: than the octane that we started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pulling oxygen from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the gasoline to produce the
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is when you burn this
six-pound gallon of gasoline, you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: producing 19 pounds of CO2 and we do that
in the US 376 million times a day as of
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an example of the power of
surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm guessing most of you were
surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as educators, we should think about
how to use surprise strategically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if we had more time,
I'd ask you for examples of where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: learned things by surprise and where
you've taught by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'll share the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're gonna think about that 19
pounds of CO2 as a gallon of gas is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't seem weird to think that it
weighs six pounds, but 19 pounds of an
[SPEAKER_01]: invisible gas is a bit harder to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna think about gallon size
balloons and how many gallon size balloons
[SPEAKER_01]: it would take 19 pounds of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a balloon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we were in person, I would hand
some out and ask you to hold it empty and
[SPEAKER_01]: think about how much it weighs and then
fill it up to about a gallon size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally I have a gallon jug and I forgot
to get it out for this morning or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about the size of a gallon milk
jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many of these do you think it would
take to hold 19 pounds of carbon dioxide?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you got to subtract the
weight of the balloon itself and just
[SPEAKER_01]: think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contents of the balloon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does anybody want to put in the chats
and guesses on how many balloons it would
[SPEAKER_01]: take to hold 19 pounds of CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a sort of helpful thing along the way
is to think about some other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh about 19 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, for the sake of time,
I'll just rattle that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a one-year-old child.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a really large cat like the
larger of my two cats, a 20 pound bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything is in the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many balloons, gallon size balloons
would it take to hold 19 pounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll just spill the beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 1,100.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we had 25 people here, everybody
would have to blow up 44 since I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're about twice that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody would have to blow up something
like 20 balloons in order for us to get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough balloons to hold the carbon dioxide
from burning one gallon of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll look at that in animation form
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes, 100 balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 200, 300, 400, 500, 600,
700, 800, 900, 1,000, and 1,100.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of balloons from one gallon
of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also do the calculations to
figure out how many balloons worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen it took to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so burning that 19 pounds of gas
produces 19 pounds, or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: six pound gallon of gas yields 19 pounds
of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're burning, oh, I forgot to
update that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year in 2022, we only burned 369
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went up last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big dip in the pandemic,
but we're still, we are now burning over 7
[SPEAKER_01]: billion or producing over 7 billion pounds
of carbon dioxide every day just from
[SPEAKER_01]: burning gasoline, which is about a quarter
of US emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll jump ahead back to our graphite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll ask again, it's a lot less about
the same or a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll spill the beans again as we take
a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gallon of gasoline is about 87 percent
carbon by weight, which if you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: that octane, you can maybe picture that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there's more than, there's
about five and a half pounds of carbon in
[SPEAKER_01]: every six pound gallon of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pure graphite like this is pure
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, no, we've actually got to
go to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how much carbon is in every
gallon of gasoline that we burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, of course, doesn't look like this
because it's in carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an invisible gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that much carbon is coming out of your
tailpipe for every gallon you burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will confess that I meant to order a
six by six by two inch block initially,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I goofed on the form and ended up
ordering one that's a third of the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually I think ends up working
well pedagogically because the real answer
[SPEAKER_01]: is just too unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working up to it is a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go on to the next piece
here of talking about how we might take
[SPEAKER_01]: that carbon back out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's very important to
recognize that the simplest thing to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: not break something rather than break it
and then fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't exactly break the
atmosphere, but we changed the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we want to figure out how to
change it back to the way it was when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was born, maybe, and take that carbon back
out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the simplest technology for doing that
is planning stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood, it turns out, is about half carbon
by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to take five and a half
pounds of carbon out of the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: by growing wood, how much wood do you
need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it will make the math easier and say
that wood is 50% carbon, which means that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to grow 11 pounds of wood to
sequester each gallon of gasoline you
[SPEAKER_01]: burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't let that wood burn or decay
because that'll put the carbon back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should make you say, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happens that an eight foot
two by four standard eight foot two by
[SPEAKER_01]: four, like this broke one right here,
weighs about 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for every gallon of gas, you need to
grow this much wood if that's your
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for taking the carbon back out of
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can go on from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's me and my two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means 11 pounds times 370 pounds
would be six million is over four billion
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of wood every day, one and a half
trillion pounds a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should make you say, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to stop here with wherever
we replace a hot process with a cooler
[SPEAKER_01]: one, we reduce emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think the hope and the
courage can come in is figuring out how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can replace fire in the energy system with
other ways of achieving our goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll note that methane, which is the
largest source of energy in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States right now, I believe, things are
rapidly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But methane typically burns at about 3,500
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most of the things we do with it,
we do not need that level of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's exciting to think about other
ways to do the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I did on time,
but I'm going to stop there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were pretty much pitch perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about two or three minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a very good perspective
on, especially connecting to many
[SPEAKER_03]: audiences, but especially younger
audiences, this problem of scale and how
[SPEAKER_03]: much of a vision this problem it is in our
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we're waiting, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll just note, I think we miss
communicating the urgency of climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change an awful lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding scale, helping people
understand scale, I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental to helping understand the
urgency of the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we do have one question in the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were mentioning growing wood as a
way to help offset it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were wondering other types of
life, in this case, like native grasses
[SPEAKER_03]: that may support wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have perspective on those kind of
other things that we can look at as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, generally, plant matter is
about 45% to 50% carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all sort of works towards the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grasses may have a lot of their root
system underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of that mass may be protected from
wildfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking about fire and wildfire is
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend the writings of Stephen
Pine, P-Y-N-E, who is a fire scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the managed fire of grasses is an
important part of making the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of really rich areas
where you can go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And invasive grasses, like cheatgrass in
Colorado, can produce more problems with
[SPEAKER_01]: wildfire than native grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of interest in ways to go
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see Jennifer's got a hand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don, can you talk about how long wood can
last in the ecosystem in store corbin as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to a grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the sort of time cycle difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great question that I do not
know the answer off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may well be in our,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our grasses, we have a really rich online
text called Earth at Home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grasses section may include info
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not read every page of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote some pages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may find info here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also put the Earth at Home
climate page where you can find a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: more climate specific materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before the hour is up, I'll add a link
to the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
