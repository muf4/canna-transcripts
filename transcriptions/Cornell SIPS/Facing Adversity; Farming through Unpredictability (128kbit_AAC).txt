[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Mike Hoffman, one of the associate
deans in the College of Ag and Life
[SPEAKER_04]: Sciences and director of the Cornell
University Agricultural Experiment
[SPEAKER_04]: Station, the one in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I welcome you to tonight's panel
conversation, discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: The title of the program is Facing
Adversity, Farming Through
[SPEAKER_04]: Unpredictability, also known as climate
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real pleasure to have some esteemed
guests on the panel tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will, I'll just introduce them by
name now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later on, they'll provide more information
about their farm and background.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Paul Raskavich, Jenny Christ,
and Allison Shatrakhan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my task is to provide a background,
sort of an overview of the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, oh, I'd like to acknowledge
two people before we get started,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's Jennifer Benson and Sharon
Dietzer, both from Cal's Alumni Affairs
[SPEAKER_04]: and Development, for helping organize all
this and get you all here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me provide a backdrop to this
topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with the basics, climate
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just imagine the atmosphere is a blanket,
and it's just the right thickness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been that way for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: To retain, you have high energy sunlight
coming in, reflected off the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a lower energy, it bounces back and
forth, just like in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that blanket has been optimal at about
270 parts per million of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_04]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we have agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why civilization has flourished.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that concept of a blanket in mind,
and things are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the graph, on the right,
those are graphs of the three primary
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide on the
top, methane and nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the 270 parts per million is a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kept everything just where we need it
to be, to be where we are today as a
[SPEAKER_04]: civilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in 2012, we hit 394 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a 40% increase in that
concentration of carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that blanket is getting thicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, things are heating up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sun, the energy is not radiating back
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This concept of greenhouse gases,
several people in the 1800s, one guy by
[SPEAKER_04]: the name of Jack Kendall came up with this
concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was my buddy in high school track.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But looking forward to the year 2100,
it is likely we're going to have 900 parts
[SPEAKER_04]: per million by that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you look at the scale,
where that trajectory, just imagine right
[SPEAKER_04]: now at the top chart, it says 360,
but that would go to 900.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to grasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the direction we are headed as
business as usual without making any major
[SPEAKER_04]: changes in how we operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Global average temperatures are increasing
one and a half degrees since the
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrial Revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting warmer at the poles,
generally warming twice as fast as near
[SPEAKER_04]: the equator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not uniform.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alaska has warmed about seven degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western Antarctic, about 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hottest decade ever was 2001 to 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year in the US, it was the hottest
year ever recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we exceeded previous records by one
degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summers are warmer and longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter is warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, business as usual, we are
likely to hit 80.
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 degrees Fahrenheit increase by 2100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to put it in perspective,
the last ice age was 8 degrees colder.
[SPEAKER_04]: The evidence is all around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle, I'm sure you've heard about
this summer loss of Arctic sea ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's reduced about 40% from historical
records.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think that in area,
that's about the equivalent of half of the
[SPEAKER_04]: continental US, which has always been
reflective because it's totally white.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's deep blue ocean and can absorb
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bit of a feedback mechanism
potential there.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right, glaciers are retreating
pretty much universally around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydroelectric power.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% of Bolivia's hydroelectric power comes
from melting glaciers, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: and irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oceans lower left are rising just an
eighth of an inch a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't sound like much.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good part of that is simply water
expands when it warms.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oceans are warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water is expanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The balance of that, a good portion of it,
is coming from the melting glaciers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, upper left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody hiked, been in Colorado in the
last two, three, four years in the
[SPEAKER_04]: mountains?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought this was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you'll note that's a photograph I
took.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a good portion of the trees are dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason being, long-term drought,
warmer winters, warmer summers,
[SPEAKER_04]: and bark beetles love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the scale of that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It encompasses about 78,000 square miles
from the southern tip of the Rockies up
[SPEAKER_04]: into British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And British Columbia there is where there
are no trees left.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, kind of a global picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to bring it down to the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: More extreme weather, floods, droughts,
high temperature stress, new pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, things are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The southern insects are going to,
again, I'm an entomologist, job security.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll have new invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's basically getting less
predictable.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we have some
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have water in this part of the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Longer seasons, warmer seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look around the world,
around just in the U.S., other parts of
[SPEAKER_04]: the country are going to be under greater
stress, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: In California, for example, the
precipitation patterns in the Sierras is
[SPEAKER_04]: shifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shifting towards more rain during the
winter instead of snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no banking of a reservoir of
water to tap during the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then throw in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and a lot of competition for
[SPEAKER_04]: that water.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it positions us here a little
kind of on the upside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, well, the scale of this is from
1870 to now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of those bars represents a decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see an increase in heat
stress, days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_04]: and likewise the right side, increase in
heavy rains.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is two inches in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bar on the far right is 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of challenges, but then back to
the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potential to expand and diversify
agriculture, new crops, new varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter canola were growing at Northern New
York for the first, in 1990 you could not
[SPEAKER_04]: do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: California's grape industry is suffering,
especially in San Joaquin Valley because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting too high sugar content.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, this opens up
opportunities for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Double cropping, and we have markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30% of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: populations out here in this part of the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we market this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Local grown, lower carbon footprint
produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for job creation, economic
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do we need to adapt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Better decision tools for our producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: When does it make sense to put additional
cooling in a dairy facility because hot
[SPEAKER_04]: cows produce less milk?
[SPEAKER_04]: When should I switch to a new crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Water management is going to be a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either too much or not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when do I put in additional tiling?
[SPEAKER_04]: When do I buy irrigation equipment?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's communication strategies among
farmers, educators, and researchers,
[SPEAKER_04]: and clearly communicating to policymakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's adaptation to these changes,
but then we can't forget about mitigation,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is reducing our carbon contribution
to the atmosphere, greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_04]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on-farm, increased energy efficiencies
using less fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuel waste conversion to heat,
anaerobic digestion, reduced tillage cover
[SPEAKER_04]: crops, and improved nutrient management
are all ways to mitigate the impact of
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture on climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So trying to pulling some of this
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: The summary, more uncertainty,
more risk in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's opportunities to mitigate and
adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture in New York State is
positioned to expand and diversify,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have the capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look around at our farmer community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooperative Extension, Cornell,
other institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you will hear from our panelists,
farmers are on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making decisions every day on new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to hear from both of the
producers on what they're doing to adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, there are activities in
response to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's new initiatives across the state
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been involved for two years in a
joint effort with Canadians, directly to
[SPEAKER_04]: the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow, climate change and international
borders, it's insignificant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're looking to see what
opportunities they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, 75% of their population lives
in eastern Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got incredible markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: We recently started this Institute for
Climate Change and Agriculture at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some new reports out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And clearly, Cooperative Extension,
as Allison will describe, is a resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I'll turn back to our own
producers as a resource of new
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'll turn to the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jenny's going first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to, if you don't mind,
we'll hold questions until the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jenny Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I work with my parents on our Apple
orchard in the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound about right?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 600 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have about eight different
non-contiguous locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are closer or farther away from the
Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have varying altitudes also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get to observe some of the
different climatic impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, I sort of categorize some of
the different ways that the changing
[SPEAKER_02]: climate affects us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it earlier springs, hotter summers,
milder winters, a longer growing season,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more severe storms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just go through each of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So earlier springs, there's been a lot of
press about the frost and how it damaged
[SPEAKER_02]: the apple crop this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different ways it damaged the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the,
[SPEAKER_02]: those apples are actually dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're brown inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the baby apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there can be scarring,
the quality issues on apples that are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually reach harvest maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all because the apples are much
more prone to frost once they're at a
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the springs are earlier because we
have a mild winter, and this past winter
[SPEAKER_02]: we started seeing spring in March,
then the apples reach a susceptible stage
[SPEAKER_02]: much earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're more prone to the cold weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, Dr. Art Degatano has done
some research about the killing frosts
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's predicting that the frost risk is
going to increase through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's probably gonna be,
we categorize it by 10% kill, or 50% kill,
[SPEAKER_02]: or 90% kill of the apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's probably going to be about the
same number of 10% kills, but more 50 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% kills, just because of the variability
of the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, Ryan and I on the way up,
we're trying to figure out, Ryan's our
[SPEAKER_02]: farm credit loan officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to figure out the
difference in yield between a good site
[SPEAKER_02]: and a poor site, and how much extra you
could afford to pay for a good site over a
[SPEAKER_02]: poor site to prevent against frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, it's very interesting this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, we could really see the
difference in a good site and a poor site.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good site had pretty much a full crop,
like maybe 1,000 bushel per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a poor site could have so little that
we didn't even bother to pick it,
[SPEAKER_02]: so almost zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, we average like 500 bushel
per acre difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you take an average market price in
a good year when there's a short crop of
[SPEAKER_02]: $14 per bushel, and then take out your
variable costs, so do a 30% gross margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about $2,100 just for the
difference in yield, not even counting the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really interesting because when
you go to purchase a new site,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might want to take that into
consideration as far as what you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to, what you're willing to buy an acre
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're planning to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the frost event won't occur every
year, but if it occurs once every 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, or if it occurs twice in 20,
you might want to figure that in,
[SPEAKER_02]: the $2,100.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can add the quality
contribution on top of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some more examples of hilltop
sites in the Hudson Valley, planting on
[SPEAKER_02]: the hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing we do for frost,
before I get to the summer part,
[SPEAKER_02]: when there is a frost coming, we have a
wind machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also tried out some helicopters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The helicopters are really hard to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a less consistent result,
and you have to work closely with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pilot.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad had a lot of fun with them in the
middle of the night last spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be $300 to $1,000 per hour being on
standby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had them work up the hill, so as it got
colder three nights in a row in late
[SPEAKER_02]: April, they moved up the hill to cover the
higher and higher ground as we gave up on
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, it was really hard to
measure the benefit that they did or
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't give.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were frustrated with our ability to
get the helicopter right where we wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have preferred to drive it
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the wind machines are a more
consistent result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see the difference between the
areas that we didn't have the wind machine
[SPEAKER_02]: at similar elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they cost about $30,000 to $40,000 to
install.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can maybe protect about 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they also require a significant
amount of fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are becoming more techy,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have them come on automatically
when it reaches a certain temperature and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that if you get the newer
kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some different options to
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it all depends on the
specifics of the night about whether
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an inversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if there's no warm air up above,
it doesn't help too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also the consideration
about crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, we think it's a really
important thing to buy crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's the different levels you
can choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have crop insurance,
the amount you're willing to invest in a
[SPEAKER_02]: helicopter or in a wind machine is
probably a little less than if you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ryan and I tried to figure out what
that level was too, but it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a 50% deductible on the
crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets really hard to figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'd be easier if you knew exactly
what temperature it was going to be that
[SPEAKER_02]: night and exactly what impact that would
have on the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hotter summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Mike was saying, we have longer hot
spells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat waves are more intense and more
frequent, an increased frequency of
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to make sure my dad wasn't going to
be too embarrassed if I showed these
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is wrought on honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's caused probably by a few things,
but especially by sunburn, which allows
[SPEAKER_02]: the rot spores to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It damages the surface of the apple and
kind of cooks it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that can be aggravated by a lack of
water also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the surface temperature of
the apple can be 30 degrees higher on hot
[SPEAKER_02]: days than the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's 100 degrees out, the surface of
the apple can be 130 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot of stress,
especially on this delicate variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've also only been growing
honeycrisp for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something we've seen a big
change in over the course of the climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is something we factor in with the
warmer summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing that we do is a lot of drip
irrigation just to relieve the stress on
[SPEAKER_02]: the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can see the high density
plantings that we're transitioning to in
[SPEAKER_02]: the apple world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a second leaf tree on the tall
spindle, Terrence Robinson's new planting
[SPEAKER_02]: style from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those trees were planted the
previous growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the apples on them,
which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a drip line in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's not a huge root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those little trees are already
producing fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they really need the support of the
water to grow the tree and also to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more stress there is on the tree,
the more stress there will be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit, and the lesser the quality of the
fruit in the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another block.
[SPEAKER_02]: That block is older, probably like five or
six years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see there's just not a lot of
tree structure there for the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really have to keep the water
applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that's interesting,
you can hear about irrigate, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: overhead for frost control, freeze
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Washington, they also overhead
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do evaporative cooling to cool down
the fruit and prevent loss of water in the
[SPEAKER_02]: orchard on the hot days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking of trying something like
that on our honeycrest, but on a high
[SPEAKER_02]: value crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, honeycrest sold this year for
like $80 a bushel.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a normal year, a good bin of cider
apples is like $90.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a whole bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honeycrest for a high value crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also, with the hot summers,
experimenting with some sun protectants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're mostly calcium based.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a sunscreen on the
apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just have to be really careful
that it will wash off, and it can also
[SPEAKER_02]: impact color development on the apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried it on a lot of honeycrest,
and some of the color hasn't developed
[SPEAKER_02]: quite the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it needs to wash off, otherwise it
looks like the apple has spray all over
[SPEAKER_02]: it, even though it's just calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very appealing to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the milder winters is the next
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the milder winters impact us a
little bit less.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on average four degrees warmer
than the 70s, according to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to wait a little bit longer for
the trees to harden off if we start with a
[SPEAKER_02]: milder winter before we start pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year and last year we waited at least
a month longer before we started our
[SPEAKER_02]: serious pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you make a big wound in the
tree before it's hardened off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get winter injury when it cools
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the milder winters can encourage the
deer population.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our new deer fence we put in last
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a deer jump over an eight foot tall
fence, so don't do a six foot tall one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it cost about $15,000 a mile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did seven miles of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we figured out, based on the area that
was enclosed, it was about $600 an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can impact production by about 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a farm that's had a deer fence for
a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just saw the production climb up
and up in the years after the deer fence
[SPEAKER_02]: was installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're pretty big believers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now four of our locations have deer fences
in the return on investment for a deer
[SPEAKER_02]: fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the nice things about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a longer growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never thought we could grow pink
ladies before, but we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are in their third leaf,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have beautiful pink ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that we've experienced with
them is because of the longer growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season, the insects have more time to get
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the summer disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to protect those apples
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some insects can have a third generation
that didn't used to have a third
[SPEAKER_02]: generation, as you have a longer growing
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to keep staying on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago, we never thought we'd grow
fugees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fugees are actually harvested before
pink ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're a no brainer now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as it gets warmer, they can grow them
more in western New York and other areas
[SPEAKER_02]: farther north.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe more severe storms are
associated with climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if that necessarily means
hail, but there is more rain and more
[SPEAKER_02]: wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what can happen if your
trellis system isn't good enough on a
[SPEAKER_02]: hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my dad ends up doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as the tree can be salvaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing we've learned is as we
switch to these higher density plantings
[SPEAKER_02]: that we really need a stronger trellis
system that will hold that kind of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when we get these high wind
storms and the soggy ground and the
[SPEAKER_02]: shallow root system on a big hill,
like I showed you at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really have to build for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our Jamaican guys told us we
weren't thinking very much when we set
[SPEAKER_02]: these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hail, of course, I'm not sure if
that's particularly associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change, but it tends to come with
strong storms sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not an awful lot we can do
about that, unfortunately, except to
[SPEAKER_02]: diversify our locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one reason we have so many
different locations and we're spread out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be more convenient to be on one
spot, but it diversifies the risk a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the crop insurance is really,
really, really important when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: hail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, I guess the most important
thing is to invest wisely in your sites
[SPEAKER_02]: for elevation and air drainage,
but also for water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we have bigger, longer droughts
or hotter summers and want to use
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporative cooling, we need to have the
water available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really think through carefully it
might sound like a big number per acre
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would have to invest to have the
nicer site, but it might be worth it,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially looking at climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can diversify in location to
spread your risk, that's also very
[SPEAKER_02]: important for severe storms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then invest wisely in your plantings,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Choose the site carefully to match the
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put our pink ladies on the southern
facing slope on the farm farthest to the
[SPEAKER_02]: south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put our honeycrisp that suffer from
the heat, we put them on the north facing
[SPEAKER_02]: slope on the farm farthest to the north.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between choosing the varieties that the
market wants and then placing them
[SPEAKER_02]: carefully on your different locations to
have the best return, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: At $10,000 or more per acre by the time
you set it all up, you can't afford to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a lot of mistakes planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then carefully consider the frost
control measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, I mean, a lot of the
things that I talked about with the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change, they're good management
practices in general and things that
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers have been doing for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may need to do them more frequently now
or to a larger, greater degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to point out that
climate change, it's a risk that we face.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dealing with it step by step.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gradual change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of other risks that
factor into business management.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our biggest business risk right now
is having an affordable and legal labor
[SPEAKER_02]: force and willing labor force.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's great we have Cornell and
Extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they help us through these climate
change issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Hudson Valley lab is there for us
every spring when we're confronting things
[SPEAKER_02]: like the frost and giving us the heads up
on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they send daily emails and are always
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the research on the stink bug and some
of the different insects and the extended
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycles of the insects is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're glad that Cornell is there for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pass it on to Paul.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my name is Paul Raskowitz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a fourth generation onion grower from
Orange County, New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: I farm in partnership with my father.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thinking about different weather
patterns and farming through
[SPEAKER_05]: unpredictability, I thought I'd just share
some of the experiences that we've had
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because weather has certainly had an
impact in our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much for the good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'll start off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned I'm an onion grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's primarily what historically what
we've grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, two years ago we started growing
some winter squash and pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've grown some corn and soybeans on
and off over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I'm going to start with last
season, 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last season was an extremely wet year
right from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed like we were fighting the wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All season long we had some onions that we
planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so wet they rotted.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ripped some up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We planted squash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all season long it stayed wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course that was ended in
August by Hurricane Irene and Tropical
[SPEAKER_05]: Storm Lee where we had eight to nine
inches of rain in less than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the soil already being saturated,
of course we flooded.
[SPEAKER_05]: On our farm we lost about 85% of the crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dollar value is somewhere around 300,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So needless to say it was a pretty hard
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some growers in the valley who
lost their entire crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: One advantage that I did have last year is
I planted about eight acres of squash in
[SPEAKER_05]: upland outside of the muck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course that didn't flood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the only squash I ended up
selling last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a result, this past summer,
2012, I did grow some more squash in
[SPEAKER_05]: upland.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had approximately 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course that presents other
challenges with wildlife.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Jenny mentioned challenges with
deer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had deer and woodchucks which did quite
a bit of damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one four-acre field.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a poor location because right next
to it was our neighboring dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had his bunk silo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the deer would go to eat some silage
and they'd come into the squash field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they went down the hill and onto
the muck and ate pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I won't be growing that field next
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, this growing season was
actually a fairly decent growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started off a little on the dry side.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were able to get an early start.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good growing season until we got
to the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this fall was extremely wet which
resulted in serious quality issues in our
[SPEAKER_05]: onions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems the first onions we harvested
were very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anything harvested after a certain
date just sort of broke down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only that, but the weather stayed
wet for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have any good drying air to help
dry the crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this year with squash, we did have
an early frost, a very hard frost in early
[SPEAKER_05]: October.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I probably lost about 12 acres of
butternut squash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other squash was a little
hardier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did have a lot of problems
harvesting just because of the wet
[SPEAKER_05]: weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only because of the weather,
but we were also faced with a labor
[SPEAKER_05]: shortage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's tough around the state,
but particularly in Orange County,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had a difficult time getting labor in
the fall to pick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So normally I can line up day crews,
come pick squash when it's ready to be
[SPEAKER_05]: picked.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this year I had a hard time finding
day crews.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then days when I could get a crew,
it ended up raining and couldn't pick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking back at some of the quality
issues we had with onions, I think a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of that stems from last year with the
flooding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime you have a flood, you have all
kinds of bacteria and other pathogens come
[SPEAKER_05]: in with the floodwaters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, we had a very mild
winter last winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So things didn't freeze to kill a lot of
the pathogens as you normally would have
[SPEAKER_05]: if you had a nice hard freeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this winter we've had some cold
weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping we get some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, thinking ahead to next year,
I'm going to be cutting back some on
[SPEAKER_05]: squash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not so much worried about the weather
as I am about labor with the squash
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can grow it, but if you can't
get it picked, it doesn't do you any good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to be growing some more
corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I've noticed, you talk about
warming temperatures and opportunities for
[SPEAKER_05]: new crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say 10 years ago, you probably saw
very few, if any, soybeans growing in
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange County.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know just this past summer, there's been
at least two grain bins that have gone up
[SPEAKER_05]: around the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's quite a few more acres of
soybeans being grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will also continue to grow some on
upland, although not as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to summarize things, thinking about
severe weather patterns and just farming
[SPEAKER_05]: through unpredictability, I think whether
you're dealing with climate change or not,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mother Nature is always going to throw you
a curveball, even in a normal year,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever that is anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think one thing I've learned,
it's good to be at least a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: diversified so that you can spread your
risk out over more than one crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have all your eggs in one basket,
particularly with a high value or a crop
[SPEAKER_05]: like onions where you have pretty high
input costs, it's good to diversify a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I think in general, you just need
to be willing and able to adapt to change,
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly to unpredictable events,
whether it be weather-related or
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, I think I'll turn it over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alison Chathurchan and I'm from
Dutchess County Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're gonna pull up my talk
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, this is the clicker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd start off with a short
video and I might have to hit the... So
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very fortunate to be working
half-time for the last almost two years on
[SPEAKER_01]: a new initiative that we're very fortunate
that Helene Dillard... This is a
[SPEAKER_08]: production of Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we... Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working on a new statewide
cooperative extension team and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: providing half-time funding for five
educators around the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have someone working on agriculture
specifically, Mary Regge in Oneida County.
[SPEAKER_01]: My focus is on climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been working with Cornell
University faculty to develop new outreach
[SPEAKER_01]: materials on climate change to bring them
out to our extension audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of the new mechanisms
that we're using to reach out to farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm only gonna show a little bit of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been very lucky on Fishkill Farms
not to have any severe effects from the
[SPEAKER_03]: big storms of last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our neighbors have certainly had a lot
of trouble across the river in Costa
[SPEAKER_03]: County.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was tremendous damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not only from the Irene storm and
the hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also... There have been wind and
hail events throughout the last couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years that have periodically caused...
Caused havoc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the October snowstorm knocked over a
lot of trees as well and broke a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, there have been quite a few events
that are quite severe and we're seeing big
[SPEAKER_03]: swings on the rainfall side as well
between drought and prolonged periods of
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely heavy rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just gives you a brief overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did hear from Jenny and she's a
similar fruit orchard farmer in the Hudson
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I show that is that we're just
starting new ways of reaching out to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and doing some of these short
video clips that we'll be posting on
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change website at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to keep this
NIFA priority in mind that as we see a
[SPEAKER_01]: changing climate, we need to help our
agricultural system, help our farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: adapt to a changing climate while
maintaining their economic vitality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what our program work team
is doing at Cornell and our statewide
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's also interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a recent study of farmers done
at Iowa State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be possible to do a similar study
of attitudes of farmers in New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: to really understand scientifically what
their knowledge is of climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Iowa, actually, 66% of farmers
indicate they believe climate change is
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, only 8% believe it's caused by
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35% believe it's equally caused by humans
and natural causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% due to natural causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, while it is positive that 66%
of farmers believe that climate change is
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring now, we do still have some work
to do in our communication and our
[SPEAKER_01]: outreach and providing the research that's
taking place at Cornell out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mentioned our new statewide
energy and climate change team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to contact your
local educators in your local office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your Cooperative Extension boards,
boards of directors, and your agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they've gone through training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have questions about extreme
weather events, they can certainly contact
[SPEAKER_01]: our team or contact researchers at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with what I mentioned is
a program work team on climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this really is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mechanism where faculty, our staff,
and our extension educators can come
[SPEAKER_01]: together usually in person twice a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have communications and other
work teams that are working on committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allows us to better communicate
to each other about research, about
[SPEAKER_01]: funding opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently submitted an EPA environmental
education grant that will provide a funded
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change education for several
different enrolled volunteer programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: including Master Gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope that kind of collaboration will
help bring more funding to Cooperative
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension and to Cornell researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned that we have been working
on new communications outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been at Empire Farm Days at the New
York State Fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been at fairs like the Dutchess
County Fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a similar talk for our agricultural
breakfast where we had 100 people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room to talk about extreme weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're gonna see an increase
in this type of communication from
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll end with some win-win benefits
that I think both of our producers talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really taking on some of this work to
start thinking about climate change is
[SPEAKER_01]: good for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for farmers because it can
reduce risks and help prepare for extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take advantage of the
opportunities that Michael mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can improve your operations and
upgrade infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are several incentive programs
for New York farmers through NYSERDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can contact Cooperative Extension
if you have questions about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can help promote local sustainable
economic growth through local food
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, biofuels, and production
agriculture here in New York and help
[SPEAKER_01]: support our communities and become more
sustainable in upstate New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout New York State.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, this is a production of
Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen any local effects of extreme
weather and climate change in the years,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially because you're native here to
Dutchess County?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like the winters are getting much
milder.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting more, I think more severe
weather as we head south seems to be
[SPEAKER_06]: getting more snow, more cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Winters are not nearly as bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had three major weather events in
the last couple of years, one,
[SPEAKER_06]: two years ago, the excessive snow
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last fall with the, you know, being hit by
tremendous amounts of rain, the hurricane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this winter with, I don't ever
recall a winter of this as easy as it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone through snowless winters,
but never with as mild as it's been.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have a winter, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't have a winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see a lot less hay was fed,
a lot less hay was used, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for those that didn't have to
buy hay, but it's poor for those of us
[SPEAKER_06]: that sell hay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the insect population and the bad
bugs that weren't killed.
[SPEAKER_06]: In today's paper, there was a major thing
about Lyme disease being perhaps the
[SPEAKER_06]: banner year for Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really, concerned over what's
coming down the road, even though I can't
[SPEAKER_06]: predict.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only hope that things won't be as
dire as they may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to your farm during the
extreme weather events and how much money
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it affect you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it started in April last year
with the fact that we had so much trouble
[SPEAKER_06]: getting the crops in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, we got them seeded and we
couldn't even go back and roll them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll them and pick up rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which in turn, we probably got a poorer
catch of seed than we should have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that bothered us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just little things that,
you know, don't always add up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that you have to send people
again and again back to the field because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a big wet spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go around and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost probably half our oak.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost a whole crop because we couldn't
get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't harvest it in the window that
we had.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest thing that's bothering me
right today is that we left probably
[SPEAKER_06]: $15,000 worth of hay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second cutting grass hay in the field that
we could not harvest last fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: We made many attempts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some in, but we knew a lot of hay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we left $15,000 worth of hay in the
field, which is really financially
[SPEAKER_06]: bothering me right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strapping me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost a field of corn that was,
you know, a lot of it was management fault
[SPEAKER_06]: for not chopping that field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We left it for grain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought we could get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got the late snow storm and it was
very tall corn and it took it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost a lot of corn over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we probably lost a minimum of 40,000 or
so in crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a farmer, you can weather the storm,
but you can't weather continuous storms.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take it on the chin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spring brings eternal hope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, as a farmer, that's what fuels
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what, you know, as I become
alive, I mean this winter, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: as the warm weather comes, we all feel
like doing more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a farmer, it's just so much easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we think again this year,
I have this probably skewed vision that
[SPEAKER_06]: this is going to be the best year ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, we are doing these videos,
short video clips as a way to have farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: speak to farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will be up on the cornell,
climatechange.cornell.edu website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping to engage other
Cooperative Extension educators around the
[SPEAKER_01]: state to go out and do the, you know,
talk to their farmers and, and the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: that they work with and capture some of
more of these videos so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not the ones out there preaching to
farmers, but they can talk to themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are some of the resources that
we have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were fact sheets out in the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we're going to have a
conversation, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I admitted I was an entomologist
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a few assumptions that the new
conditions, the weather, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: are aggravating pests in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we have a similar set of
circumstances, then I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: surprised if it happens again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best, I mean, obviously I can't
predict the weather, but it's these
[SPEAKER_04]: unusual wet spells, cold spells,
whatever, interacting together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sometimes it's just like I
mentioned, the bark beetles, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just perfect and insect populations take
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could also be, I don't think that's
migratory, but I mean, we're also having
[SPEAKER_04]: new storm fronts come through that also
bring in pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Larry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess it's on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's always been a challenge,
I think, communicating with consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There seems to be a growing disconnect
between the farming community and the rest
[SPEAKER_05]: of humanity, especially as there's fewer
and fewer farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing I did notice last year with
the hurricane, being that we had such
[SPEAKER_05]: extensive damage in Orange County,
the local community and consumers really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really took notice of, you know,
what we were going through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they did a number of tests
for community events.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a sort of a local farm aid in the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they started out with the goal
of raising $20,000 by the 20th of whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: month it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they ended up raising just over
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had a big event, sort of an
educational event where the community
[SPEAKER_05]: could come in, you know, talk directly to
farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, you know, various exhibits set
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it took an event like that
where consumers, at least locally,
[SPEAKER_05]: took notice of what the farmers in the
area were going through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, it's, well, Larry, you know,
the frustration of trying to communicate
[SPEAKER_05]: our problems and not only our problems,
but how produce gets to the shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, even though we have a
severe shortage locally, it's always going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be there in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also there seems to be one thing I did
notice, you know, there's this myth out
[SPEAKER_05]: there that all farmers get subsidies and
crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to somebody, you know,
they mentioned crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, well, don't you have crop
insurance?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, well, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, well, did you get anything from
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, yeah, we received about,
I think, $80,000 from crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, wow, that's quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's quite a bit of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, yeah, but our seed bill alone was
$120,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, and, you know, that was a
shock to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, I don't know, it's a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we were pretty careful when the
frost first came not to say too much to
[SPEAKER_02]: the papers because you never know the
extent of the damage and you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: people to write off the farm markets and
not to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually were pretty conservative in
how much we told that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as a side note, my parents were
out in Washington state about a month ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's the number one apple producing
state in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just delighted out there
because they're filling into our markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just dancing around with joy,
but it's not entirely bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a food system that can handle
the variability in the different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the climates and the different
geographies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have to go hungry,
but it is a little scary for next year's
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say I don't worry about it
because of course I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think every farmer worries about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, like you were saying,
like I mentioned diversification,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think particularly with more extremes in
weather, the more you can diversify
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself, you spread that risk out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, if I plant fewer acres of
the more intensive crops such as onions
[SPEAKER_05]: and squash, I can grow corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit less input cost
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus you don't have the labor aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, with today's grain
prices, those crops have been a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more profitable than they have been in the
past.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think diversification is part of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, as any farmer
knows, you have to be willing to accept
[SPEAKER_05]: the risk because if you didn't,
well you wouldn't be in this business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know years ago my grandmother was a
great cross-stitcher and she did this one
[SPEAKER_05]: sampler and said, if you think there's
gambling in Las Vegas, just try growing
[SPEAKER_05]: onions.
[SPEAKER_05]: All around the borders they had thrips and
disease and all the different things that
[SPEAKER_05]: can affect the, you know, the onion crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's part of the game I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Janet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's becoming more and more
capital intensive all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always new technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an electronic defects order that
picks out apples with marks, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: spots on them now on the packing line
electronically, which is pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have a, or we would like to
get a half a million dollar internal
[SPEAKER_02]: defects order that shines a light through
every apple and sees if there's browning
[SPEAKER_02]: on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty expensive price tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point I think it will become
just something we have to have to market
[SPEAKER_02]: our, you know, certain crops in the
springtime when there's a risk of internal
[SPEAKER_02]: browning after long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And customers will just expect that we,
you know, that we're able to detect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I think it's one reason we really
need a strong crop insurance program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's, you know, it's not always
enough, but it's, at least it keeps you
[SPEAKER_02]: from having to dig out of quite such a big
hole because you can't afford,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, next year we want to invest in
the next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to dig out of last year's
hole, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're dealing with an insurance
program where you have to take the first
[SPEAKER_05]: 50% of the loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, I mean, you'd be crazy if you
bought an insurance program like that for
[SPEAKER_05]: your car or your house because it just
wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, you know, maybe crop
insurance has come a long way,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think it probably has a long way to
go yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before it's an effective tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like for onions we buy crop
insurance because if you don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: insurance you don't qualify for any type
of disaster aid should that come down the
[SPEAKER_05]: line.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mentioned you have to take the
first 50% of loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy up at substantially higher
premiums, but that just, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't pay either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked to some growers one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I talked to one grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The payment he received didn't cover his
premiums, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how was that, how was that an
effective tool?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even though I wouldn't like to
spend the extra money, we might have to
[SPEAKER_02]: just to ease the variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like if you were to have a fire,
you know, you buy fire insurance every
[SPEAKER_02]: year, but hopefully you never have a fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I sure wouldn't want to pay
60% more because it's already pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive, but I think we might have to
either that or ask farm credit to
[SPEAKER_02]: capitalize losses, you know, in the years
when they, I guess you can do it either
[SPEAKER_02]: way maybe depending on your banker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know a number of years ago I was
reading an article somewhere and they were
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to make the point that one way or
another consumers are gonna have to pay
[SPEAKER_05]: more for their food, whether they pay more
at the grocery store or they pay higher,
[SPEAKER_05]: continue to pay higher subsidies because,
you know, like I said, the capital that
[SPEAKER_05]: goes into agriculture these days is,
you know, pretty intense and that then
[SPEAKER_05]: again goes back to the disconnect between
consumers and farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of consumers just don't understand
what it takes to grow a crop or to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: food these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my parents and I usually see
pretty eye-to-eye on it actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just fixed our interest rates on a
couple of our bigger loans and we were
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much in agreement about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we try to manage some risk and
leave some, you know, leave some variable
[SPEAKER_02]: on the interest rates, but then on the
crop side too, you know, you buy crop
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance, but it's still a risky
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we just look at the benefit
that we could have from trying to mitigate
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the risk and then the cost of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think, you know, perception of
risk kind of varies not only throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: generations, but also throughout
individuals because I remember taking farm
[SPEAKER_05]: management in college, you know,
talking about how you know, as the older
[SPEAKER_05]: generation progresses, they get less
willing to take on risk whereas the
[SPEAKER_05]: younger generation is more willing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In case my father, I'm not so sure that's
true, he's still willing to roll the dice
[SPEAKER_05]: every year and I know he's always been
forward-thinking and looking ahead to next
[SPEAKER_05]: year and I know over the years he's
probably made several sacrifices to you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, keep us going probably for my
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and you know, like Jenny mentioned,
it's important to have a good working
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we talk constantly discuss these
things, so I think it varies a lot between
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses and between individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to work out all the numbers and
then take a look at it and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that my parents still make some
of those decisions because they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: tough ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's sort of an interesting debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, there's, I don't think
anyone's gonna argue that we're not seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: more extremes in weather because we
certainly are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether, you know, you believe that's due
to global warming climate change or if it
[SPEAKER_05]: just seems to be a cycle in a much larger
macro sense, I think there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of debate there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, we need to continue to
have that debate because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether or not climate change is real or
how much of it is man-made, I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly having an impact on agriculture
and I think, you know, we're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_05]: respond to it in some way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we're gonna have electric
tractors, but I think just agriculture in
[SPEAKER_05]: general is getting more efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: You feel costs are going up, so of course
we're gonna burn, look for ways to burn
[SPEAKER_05]: less anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a lot, most farmers are
driven to be efficient by nature just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to save on costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also worry that if we have a lot of
regulations imposed on us about climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change that we will be less able to
compete with the rest of the world and
[SPEAKER_02]: like you were saying before, you know,
Mexico and China, they'll backfill the
[SPEAKER_02]: food industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll keep the grocery store shelves
full and probably what they're doing won't
[SPEAKER_02]: be as environmentally sound as what we
were doing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just, we have to be very careful
what we impose on our farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, I mean, there's maybe
things we should be doing, but maybe it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be more on an encouragement level
than regulatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a farm three hours to the
north of us when I was a little girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents did because Macintosh grew
better up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we struggled because transporting them
back down without bruising was really
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sold the farm after a few years,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we thought about that and now
we're just tearing Macintosh out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we found a new strain that grows
better, the Ruby Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we've talked, we haven't ever
talked really too much about doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: again because we tried it the one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we've talked about relocating,
it's been more a discussion about labor
[SPEAKER_02]: than about climate change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's, I think probably does make
some sense to diversify geographically to
[SPEAKER_05]: farm in various locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, from a management side,
it gets to be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're, I've known one
grower, he's this year, I guess he's
[SPEAKER_05]: growing some squash down in the Dominican
Republic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's flying back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just can't imagine the headaches and
the costs associated with some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certainly there's advantages,
but it's a tough thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough trying to handle one
operation in one country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try and spread that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's give a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: To our panelists.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
