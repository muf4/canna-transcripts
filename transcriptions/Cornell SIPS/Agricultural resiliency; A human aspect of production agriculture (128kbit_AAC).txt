[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am going to try to do is basically
split today into two different
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk about a resiliency
project that Trevor and I are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll get into that here shortly
because we're wrapping up our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually, he and I are in process of
doing final report for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I am going to talk a little bit
about ag education because what intrigued
[SPEAKER_00]: me when I talked to Don originally is
probably trying to fit how myself as an
[SPEAKER_00]: educator ends up in or feels comfortable
in the horticulture section and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better feel for why I think that's
a pretty solid fit and hopefully going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward we can continue to develop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tuesday it will be about half and half
if all goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trevor will have to wave at me if I'm
going too slow on the research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is the report from a
resiliency growth project that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably really get kicked off in
January of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks involved in that, Trevor is a
graduate student and myself is principal
[SPEAKER_00]: investigator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have Betsy Binn who is based in
Geneva, also a member of the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: field that's co-PI on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nancy Wells is in human ecology and is
working with Trevor as his primary chair
[SPEAKER_00]: and has been involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Smith has been very involved in our
initial establishment and thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Tidball from Eden has also been a
collaborator throughout because we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using his resource base and we're actually
hitting topics that are very near and dear
[SPEAKER_00]: to Eden as it comes up in our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caroline Quentin was an outstanding
undergraduate of mine who I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: until we got going is absolutely talented
in coding interview texts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she took right off with that and was a
great deal of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to give a shout out to her as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funded by Empire State Development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give credit to Betsy is the one that
kind of flagged this at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is a project that's getting
ready to move down the pike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to get involved with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primary emphasis to get into that is
basically stemming from a whole series of
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty severe storms that we've had,
starting with Hurricane Irene,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Hurricane Sandy and Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had early spring and a really
late frost in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had unusual flooding in Penyan that
they didn't see coming because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically not something they had ever
really planned on or experienced before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had while we're in the middle
of this, we had the Buffalo severe
[SPEAKER_00]: snowfall event in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the impetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was back in Irene and Lee was the
original driving force for the funding
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Empire Development Agency group
to do a little bit of studying on the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of resiliency within our agricultural
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to do and what are we
currently at in terms of resiliency in
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular arena?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific weather impacts that we start
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of Orange County's cultivated land
was damaged in Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop losses just in Ulster County were
about five million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have numbers, but from the
Skahiri Action Report, the farms were
[SPEAKER_00]: devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of animals were lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the entire infrastructure was
underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend of mine whose house was
under 14 feet of water in Skahiri Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of issue with fall crop
damages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crops were there, but they were so
silted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to rethink how to harvest and
could they harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really pushing them beyond the
realm of anything they'd experienced in
[SPEAKER_00]: severe weather and trying to react to that
and bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Jim Held from Empire Development
pull some numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we totally wiped out, and this is
specific to the regions that we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are very localized to
specific counties that we were working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're looking at about a
billion dollars in sales just of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural sales from the group of
counties that we were working with in our
[SPEAKER_00]: focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, just in the few counties that
we're talking about, it was about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars generated that potentially
could be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not actual losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just potential if we had a total
washout like Skahiri Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trying to get an idea of,
because some of the discussion is,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why are we even considering this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this that big a deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from an economic standpoint in those
communities, it's a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, we included some jobs in those
particular areas and earnings from those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular jobs, but the sales are really
what kind of drive the point home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's potential impact if we totally
wiped out the sections we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus group regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide attaches directly to the
colored counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are totals just of the colored
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had Jim run that data so we can
compare within the different focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see if there was any huge
difference from the Western New York group
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Ulster Green Columbia County group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really didn't find they were very
similar across those economic impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was interesting given the diversity
of our New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide we can bounce back to,
but this is the focus group that we
[SPEAKER_00]: started working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get into the actual methodology,
we'll refer back to that slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: because each color code is a group that we
pull together for focus groups to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get there in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall goals of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three particular areas of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to outline economic impacts
and define where producers were in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of extreme weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good, diverse discussion to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked to North Country folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already familiar with snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow wasn't a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They automatically reverted back to the
ice storm, which was way outside of our
[SPEAKER_00]: scope, but there were still scars in there
that that's what they needed to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one time where they were
totally caught off guard, and they learned
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit from being out of power for an
extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking to Skahiri, and Skahiri
obviously was the severe flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking to the Buffalo region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't quite as concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd gotten through the snow event,
but there was some issue with other issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really where the frost event
started to become very crisp in their
[SPEAKER_00]: minds when they started talking about
trying to figure out how to recover and
[SPEAKER_00]: plan ahead in that extreme weather case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also were looking at strengths and
weaknesses of emergency response systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the communication system that we
already have in place effective or not
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, as seen from the producers,
as well as our non-producer groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two different groups that I'll show
in our methods discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really trying to assess farmers'
concern regarding severe weather events
[SPEAKER_00]: and disaster planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they doing anything for planning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they worried about severe weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this topic impact them,
and are they considering that as we move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those three goals were the overarching
perspective of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had six different research questions,
which will pop up again, that really we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to address those specific goals on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventative steps that were already in
place additional predict what didn't we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in terms of preventative steps for
the event that they were focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What factors impacted decisions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one farmer that was adding it
wasn't weather related, but he was now
[SPEAKER_00]: investing $20,000 for deer fence because
he'd made a decision that it was finally
[SPEAKER_00]: time to invest that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was losing too much from deer impact,
which wasn't weather related specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although in the last couple of winters,
we start talking about deer pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the heavy snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow load, the deer pressure was
directed towards them because it was food
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So factors, then we ended up with factors
impacting those responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The note, basically we've got along with
the producers, we're also looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: extension educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at researchers and we're
looking at state agencies, Ag and Markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Cross, DEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were their interests and what were
their thoughts compared to the producers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got those two non producer groups
and producer groups that were a subset and
[SPEAKER_00]: also part of our focus group that I'll get
to in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What new capacity is needed to mitigate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we have to add to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we have capacity already in our
land grant system, extension the research
[SPEAKER_00]: to respond to weather related crises or
are there areas that we need to develop?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking for where are we
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we move forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very exploratory in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, how do we evaluate our
response to disaster and assess the
[SPEAKER_00]: strength of networks used to coordinate
efforts?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was a, it was a great idea to
have that on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got very little feedback from that in
our focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one basically went unanswered because
we couldn't, rather the data was just not
[SPEAKER_00]: developed in the way we presented our
interview formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methods really, we've got six regions
identified, which was the colored map that
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got producers in each of those
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The producers were invited by any means we
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Trevor and I both thought we were
going to be in, it made good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were providing them a stipend to pay
for their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing them lunch and we were
trying to do it off harvest times and we
[SPEAKER_00]: still struggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, some counties are really,
really engaged, but we weren't getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: participation that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked farther out into our network of
extension and farm bureau to populate the
[SPEAKER_00]: focus group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get very interested participants,
but we were a little thinner than we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought in total numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really tried to address that as we
moved forward and were consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: forwarded in our efforts to double the
size of our focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were basically at six or eight
participants per focus group, which worked
[SPEAKER_00]: well for in-depth discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have liked to have had a second
focus group in each region and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond the producers, we did pull in a
state agency, all the groups listed came
[SPEAKER_00]: together in Albany for a focus group to
get their perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled in two different extension
educators groups, one in the western part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the state, one in Hudson Valley,
as well as some local participants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: focus groups that we had in our producer
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have one at Syracuse with FSA
representatives because they're a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: link up to the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to have some other producers come
in on that one and it ended up being just
[SPEAKER_00]: the FSA group, very intriguing discussion
points when we started talking from FSA
[SPEAKER_00]: and their connection to the feds and the
states compared to our other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Script and questions were developed,
one for producers, we slightly modified it
[SPEAKER_00]: for non-producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both were approaching the six research
questions and developing directly from
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All meetings were actually recorded and
then transcribed and we used MaxQDA
[SPEAKER_00]: software for coding analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our analysis took two different paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one that's really using the
coding system, using MaxQDA and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some results based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then actually took a little more of a,
I guess it was a high energy approach
[SPEAKER_00]: where Trevor and I basically went back
through our transcripts as we were coding
[SPEAKER_00]: and then started to break out into charts
the differences across all research
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, trying to get a little deeper than
just the coding because we were finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the coding was giving us some raw results
and we needed to find some actual
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics down underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did another layer that we'll see
here shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start talking about results.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we break out the coding, the nice
thing is it kind of hits you with the
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum discussion points of what
we found right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat, 137 citations for
resource demand and influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So producers, this is from the producers,
really needed, the thing they were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for is continued development of
opportunities for continued resource
[SPEAKER_00]: development and how do we connect to those
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was across the spectrum because we
did have each focus group had different
[SPEAKER_00]: target points.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the North Country where they were
talking ice and transportation of
[SPEAKER_00]: foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the roads are shut down, how are we
going to get through our product to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get food up into the region if
we don't have that food available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we start talking in Western New
York, they weren't quite as worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were much more worried about simply
clearing the snow out of the way and then
[SPEAKER_00]: worrying about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some water discussions out that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was very much independent of
their focus groups, which makes intuitive
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all did focus for 137 references
on resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that was very similar in
height is emergency communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't distinguish positive and
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just noted in the coding that it was
related to emergency communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news of this discussion was they
were very happy with the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: communication system as a general feel
from the state level down to the county
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, one of the driving forces for
this study is was there a connection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the producers feeling well connected
to the emergency systems when something
[SPEAKER_00]: happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And across all the focus groups,
they were actually quite positive with
[SPEAKER_00]: their county systems and their connections
to Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: One woman basically runs that whole
emergency management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all knew her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's very well connected to all the
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very encouraging to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we'd have a discussion
on the negative side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local folks weren't talking to the
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the villages were disconnected with the
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, there was a breakdown of
communication there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some counties that had some
variability of breakdown from the producer
[SPEAKER_00]: side to the emergency response side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was variability in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But across the board, they were very
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also saw extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will show up in another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension, soil and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their emergency response teams were
very active in making sure that the Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: community was brought into the fold when a
disaster hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extension service was cited 62 times
in our discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of a discussion to see how
they were fitting into the county level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with the extension
system, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some counties are very strong
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some counties have very limited
associations based on budgetary
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some historical resource points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, across the focus groups we
were working with, they were very positive
[SPEAKER_00]: about their extension systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the extension educators weren't there,
the soil and water folks picked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recovery issues weren't quite as
strong as the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was basically talking about,
OK, what we're really worried about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: aftermath.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we pick up the pieces and keep
moving forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where crop insurance starts
popping up as a reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we'll see in a specific site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about talking the
resources into recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have generators for a long enough
period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have the planning in place that we
can actually get to the resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: establish recovery?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were just the key results from
the coding breakout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trevor and I got talking and wanted to go
a little more in depth to try to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: those core, really broad stroke pieces to
some specific details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further analysis, just some examples that
pop up under resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big one that hammered basically across
all the counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've listened to NPR, it's one of
Governor Cuomo's points already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet access and cell phone coverage is
very weak in some of our areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get producers where it's not available
even on a good day, let alone in a
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of the communication systems
are starting to expect us to have cell
[SPEAKER_00]: phones and internet connection where we've
got parts in our counties that don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on a good day, it's extremely slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's becoming an issue that was very
vocalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, we need to fix that first
and then we can build up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: North Country was talking about
generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've basically already solved that
problem, but it seemed to be their key
[SPEAKER_00]: point that was in the back of their minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other operations I mentioned,
transportation and infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: were really, they said, yeah, that's fine
for the dairies, but the non-dairies were
[SPEAKER_00]: really more worried more about getting
produce or product out from their farms or
[SPEAKER_00]: into the community to make sure the
communities had resources just to not
[SPEAKER_00]: stress because of lack of food and basic
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergency communication related topics,
as I mentioned, the county and state were
[SPEAKER_00]: really seen as satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local level had an awful lot of
variability depending on whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to read their emails and were they
engaged in the practices for emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal level was, I was hoping to
have better connection to the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level and even at state level,
they didn't have a good clear vision of
[SPEAKER_00]: the connection back up to FEMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you talk about FEMA, that fizzled
out really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not as much discussion about
that federal connection even from the
[SPEAKER_00]: state level as I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state is very organized and has a lot
of plans in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal level, when we connect up to
that fed level, it does go, a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through FSA and the FSA discussion
was there's some internal communication
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the federal level, we've got more work
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one basically didn't have the data we
wanted to pull together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: FSA is farm service agency, very involved
in providing resources from the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, both to farms that meet specific
qualifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also, the farm service agency is
the primary agency that will decide on a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal declaration of disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It funnels through their agency for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the state starts looking at the point
where it's so bad that they've got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: at the federal level for disaster,
which opens up federal aid back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that farm service agency is a conduit
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's primarily seen as a lending
resource for farmers that meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that they set for federal
aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Don, for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I talked about it, the extension
service and soil and water districts are
[SPEAKER_00]: very involved in each of the regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what we expected,
but there was some discussion of how
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly that's going to show up and both
of them were very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I'm going to do,
I'm going to watch my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truncated these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are splitting the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a producer response on the
left and non-producers on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are related to each number is one of
the six research questions that we focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effective preventative steps, one element
that popped up here and didn't show up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of pictures on phones and internet
to send information right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden uses this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start doing, what's the term for it,
Trevor?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing crowdsourcing to map their
data as the event hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The educators are sending in information
off their phones right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a very short period of time in the
middle of the crisis, they can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: populate where the issues are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when we start talking to Eden
about, we had a hail event in Homer that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think anybody else in court or
Tompkins County had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 10 or 15 houses that are
replacing their entire siding and roofing
[SPEAKER_00]: through insurance because they had hail
damage in this one five to 10 acre plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talked to the growers, they didn't
see any damage because it was mostly hay,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those types of things are being
identified through this use of
[SPEAKER_00]: crowdsourcing that was one effective
preventative step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional preventative step, economic
marketing analysis, some room for improved
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas and some tools so that they can
start to identify how do we make a change?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do as part of the plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cost if we don't choose to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we say, OK, I want to invest in one
thing we talked about was water as a big
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only flooding, but also water
retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be paying attention to storing
more of the water that we have so that if
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to carry through times like
our August was really, really dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: not all farms are set up for irrigation
and don't have the water resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be leaning that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a discussion that came up in our
summit, which I'll get to in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some more thought process of tools the
producers can use because they're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-producers really were also
confident in the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did see some issues with soil erosion
after the storm and tried to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure for New York Eden.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Eden is the extension disaster
education network based in natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources here on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got really great resources,
but there was a discussion of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they're getting their message
out more to a broader population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there, but needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third and fourth ones, factors
impacting economic decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they wanted a little more,
some more tools to use for cost-benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis as they work on their planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The responses were very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very individualized depending on
what focus group you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a whole, clear communication from
county to state level, I already hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the non-producer side, the one thing we
talked about was economics of design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about the Buffalo
snowstorm where a lot of barns had
[SPEAKER_00]: collapsed and just having some numbers and
some tools to, and the one situation we
[SPEAKER_00]: also talked about was a greenhouse,
an entire business, a greenhouse business
[SPEAKER_00]: that was totally flattened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can only reinforce and overbuild
greenhouses so far before they become cost
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have that discussion and to start to
look at some economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to do that back when this was ag
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all sorts of tables for some of
that type of resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hadn't seen that at the state level in
the agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't seen new data relative to snow
loads and thought that was interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing they brought up was
once you go through the flood or you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the snowstorm, you're better
prepared next time, which is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they brought that to the point of,
okay, when we start working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers that have done this,
they're a lot more prepared the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to get their neighbors to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If neighboring counties didn't go through
this scary flood, learn from what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and try to grow before it hits them
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last two, we already talked about internet
and cell phone coverage for response in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of new capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mention of GPS locations
available, which counties should already
[SPEAKER_00]: have, but we were unsure of the uniformity
across the counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas for further research, one area was,
and this was the area for future resource
[SPEAKER_00]: really emphasized small scale agriculture,
but that was also a nature of the focus
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Batavia group was probably the only
one that I can think of that we had large
[SPEAKER_00]: operators there just by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in Schahery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schahery had a couple too, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had large operators in Schahery and
large in Batavia, but the other ones were
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily just self-selected to be smaller
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger ones were pointedly invited,
but chose not to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the biases and issues we
have with the focus group format.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they liked a little more resources put
into extension, which we're already trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do from Cornell University,
doing our active research out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extension offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pathway could be strengthened
and that's one of the points they bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they brought up FSA does a similar
crowd source thing where they've got data
[SPEAKER_00]: from their agents and that they didn't
realize Eden was using it and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really great if they could just
communicate a little bit and so they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong resource base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make those connections
because the two groups had not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sat down and had a discussion about how
each of their crowd sourcing worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one element we also talked about
from the stadium agency-wise, what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: if the cell phone system is down and the
internet's down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a mechanism in place when it
gets bad enough where the cell towers are
[SPEAKER_00]: out and the internet's down because the
infrastructure's overflowed, similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in Sandy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't been answered or addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cell phone towers now have
generators, which will help, but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those that everybody's like,
ooh, yeah, OK, we don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to start having that discussion
of what's the next step to make sure our
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure is stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concept map, we also took the overall
coding laid out and tried to come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: a flow chart just to conceptualize what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the trigger is a severe weather
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing we found is
basically all the producers agreed they're
[SPEAKER_00]: either at a low end of emergency planning
or moderate planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody honestly said they were outstanding
planning, so I left damage in there
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of a high level of planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the event, if we go through low
level of planning, that's going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: some adaptation by force because they
weren't prepared for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something has happened, and they've got to
catch back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had a moderate level of plan,
they're going to show some resiliency,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not going to affect them quite as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will trigger down into that affects
all of our producers, but also brings the
[SPEAKER_00]: government levels in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government meaning local and county
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start feeding in information,
the resources from the ag service agencies
[SPEAKER_00]: into the producers, and that producer can
start working with the resources that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have or the resources that they need to
track down, as well as trying to refine
[SPEAKER_00]: the emergency planning resources are
feeding up into communications resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and planning as a thought process to
realize that those producers have to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with all three of those towards the
idea of bringing the resources in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the second iteration,
maybe third iteration of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep trying to refine how to best
present the flow because it's not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: linear simply because that's the new
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nature of the sewer weather
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple models that I could
pull in my other resource or the next
[SPEAKER_00]: phase of this research I'm doing in my
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a different set of models that
probably we could compare with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just trying to explain what
happened in the information we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a couple community values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just statements that Trevor had pulled out
that really kind of said what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking from producer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my community, we've got a farming
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody cares about his neighbor,
and that's worth more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no government program that can
replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are farmers basically saying,
OK, I'm going to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to solve the problem one way
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't actively going out looking for
resources from the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd like to have that infrastructure
there, but they're also, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first ones down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the farmer just as a whole,
we have the ability to deal with the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to clean up if there's a
major weather event or make the repairs or
[SPEAKER_00]: replant or rebuild with the help of the
insurance company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll step in and make sure the
resources are provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the growers I talked to,
worst case scenario, he takes the tractor
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, opens the road up because
the plows haven't gotten that far and the
[SPEAKER_00]: milk truck can get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings up an interesting discussion
of liability, which we started to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, they're going
to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite regularly is, yes, the
communication system is pretty solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also feel if we've got a good
moderate level of planning, we can weather
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the incidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was also the opinion of
Schaharie County until they got hit with a
[SPEAKER_00]: 500-year flood level that they weren't
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to rethink their level of
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then, as a final piece, pulled together
about 50 to 60 individuals in Geneva for a
[SPEAKER_00]: resiliency summit as part of the grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the next stage where we brought
in researchers, a different set of
[SPEAKER_00]: educators, and a couple of producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And key pieces surfaced here that we
didn't see in our focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two big ones were water retention and
erosion issues, especially retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be paying attention to keeping
the water on site instead of letting it go
[SPEAKER_00]: down the rivers or do that as some
mitigation for flooding in a broader
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil quality and stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one producer that was adamant that
that should have been and it is important,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, we were phrasing it such that
that was an understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But should we be paying attention to make
sure that this doesn't infringe on our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Economic incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get the producers to engage in
emergency planning?
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller guys don't have the time and
don't feel they have the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger operators all have some degree
of emergency planning built into the CAFOs
[SPEAKER_00]: and their nutrient plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they actually implementing the
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, it'll sit on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we encourage them to actually think
of this as part of their planning?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ag businesses are not always connected
to the county EMS system, Emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: Management System.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the businesses quite often are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agricultural businesses sometimes are
separated out and are not as tightly now
[SPEAKER_00]: aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did talk about crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody agreed it's an important tool,
but it has some flaws in terms of being
[SPEAKER_00]: designed for Midwest where we struggle to
adapt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, county planning was also seen as
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some communication gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next steps from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically doing a summary report.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the summit, we've actually got ag
and markets connected with Trevor and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on a next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd like to take another step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't discussed what that was,
but he's excited to meet with me in
[SPEAKER_00]: November to figure out how we move forward
along with Keith out of Eden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trevor is doing a perception of climate
change from the producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to go in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually taking a dissertation off of
this base grant, looking specifically at
[SPEAKER_00]: the county level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a local emergency planning
committee mandated by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every state has one or every county has
one, but I'm also finding in talking to a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of them, there's an interesting
amount of free variability in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: useful they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the agricultural folks should
have connections to the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening in all the counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to figure out why
that's not happening, even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mandated by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the connections are not
being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some counties, they're being very well
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three different
directions we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right out of the report, we're going to
develop fact sheets and tease out the data
[SPEAKER_00]: into some more specific details we can
send back to our extension agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a growth point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of interest in the summit
to just summarize where this was as a
[SPEAKER_00]: launching point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also money coming in coming
through to soil and water agencies for
[SPEAKER_00]: more specific water mitigation,
manure storage cover mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a third one that had been
related to soil that they're getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to roll out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an exploratory project, it seemed to
develop the interest and start to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the missing information pieces
that we couldn't find in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick, any questions on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to switch to my ag
education piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that we actually had in the resiliency
summit was there's SALT, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: community generated program in Schaharie
County that's totally community funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually establishing resource
networks and a much tighter understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of the resources that are available and
the planning that's necessary to meet that
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 year flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been around for three years,
originally grant funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're establishing the resource
in much more careful data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody in the community has some
access to what happens if this develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really a model we had
presented at the summit that I think more
[SPEAKER_00]: counties where there's a high risk factor
could use to just establish they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of people on staff and they
actively work with the community members
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that level of emergency
planning is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can vary depending on
what the producer needs are and the
[SPEAKER_00]: community needs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, weird question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can come back to these if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going because I worry
about running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the research we've been
working on, which is a side project.
[SPEAKER_00]: My day job, ag education and SIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm associated with the agricultural
outreach program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably not see most of these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie works off the office, out of the
office in the North Country.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a director of New York Ag in the
classroom, deals with K through 12
[SPEAKER_00]: educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ag literacy day where they read a
children's book that's factually accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: for agriculture to I don't remember how
many thousands of children each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's her one of her big projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FFA executive secretary, currently
Julia Talofsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hired Derek Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julia's going to Minnesota, manages the
FFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 6,000 students in ag programs
across the state, which I'll show you a
[SPEAKER_00]: map of.
[SPEAKER_00]: She manages those.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry and Sherry are ones in Cobalskill
and one is in the North Country providing
[SPEAKER_00]: recruitment specialists and also support
for agricultural education teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That community is part of who I'm,
as I assume the director responsibilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll be the team that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My key job is really working in the ag
science realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 23 ag science advisees that
really focus on the soils, crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture and education perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kind of shepherd them through as
undergraduates and make sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on whatever perspective they have
and refine their career choices as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The education minor has about 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each underclass group has about 75
participants continuing to grow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Duff and I basically are working
with the rest of our faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's education faculty and development
associate and anthropology that shepherd
[SPEAKER_00]: the minor and maintain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other key piece, at least to me,
the exciting part is I teach the art of
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large survey course university
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 300 students a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every semester we run that and I've got
Trevor's in there now as my graduate TA
[SPEAKER_00]: along with Emily Dietrich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had I think three different years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a third year running graduate
teaching opportunities for horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: students and it's been outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily's got an interest in public gardens
and some art history background and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a really strong connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grant Thompson last year was outstanding
and really has shown some growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he prepares for teaching in his
professional career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a great opportunity to
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other job, I guess it comes up in my
next slide, two more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am coordinating the student
teaching and agricultural education
[SPEAKER_00]: project at Ithaca College.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell used to have an education master's
program that dissolved in 2013 due to
[SPEAKER_00]: funding and political situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time the dean reached out
and picked up Ithaca College's program and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've partnered with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of what we do is actually the
whole thing is really plant and animal
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good half of what we do in ag education
is plant based.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half is going to be animal
science based.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a picture of my
greenhouse when I taught in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing some irrigation work and
also trying to work on some potting
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also got good alignment with both
extension programs across the state and
[SPEAKER_00]: the public garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the projects between that and
plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building stronger and stronger
connections across those opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also teach an extension outreach and
instruction course that align much better
[SPEAKER_00]: with the public garden and extension
perspective because it's not specific with
[SPEAKER_00]: high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few details about the ag education
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the blue, actually all the colors,
the red colors are colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other colleges or all the other
dots, blue and green, have some connection
[SPEAKER_00]: to a high school agricultural program.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases they're fully fledged ag
programs with a certified teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases they don't have a certified
teacher but they're teaching environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: science through a science teacher or
they're teaching aquatics down on Long
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple marine science programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not certified ag teachers,
they're certified biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all these folks have been somehow
engaged with our agricultural resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of specific ag, we're talking
about 250 teachers with four positions
[SPEAKER_00]: open right now that I can't fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth is actually at an upward
swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this comes in, supply and
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationally, all the red states are in
shortage for ag teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm drawing from animal science
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also drawing from ag science,
agricultural science majors to draw them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the master's program as one
opportunity for the careers to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I taught for 17 years,
then I transitioned to FarmNet and I
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that they can at least keep
in the back of their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one young man not teaching in
high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went through ag education, got
certified and Case IH made a position for
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's training people across the Midwest
for whatever they want him to train.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they hired him because of his
educational and marketing skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a shortage across
most parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pathway is connecting with Ithaca
College.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an articulation agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nine credits, actually up to 12
credits that can transfer across the two
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start up the first cohorts this May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably have six teachers that are
in a 13 month program that'll be on campus
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of the classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll supervise their student
teaching out into the workforce as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal background, which is a deeper
connection to my agricultural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don mentioned my ostrich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I raised ostrich for 10 years in Western
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a different PowerPoint on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market's basically dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've switched to heritage breed hogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my American Guinea hogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter, the artist, snapped that
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with American Guinea hogs
just as a hobby now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did work professionally as a landscaper in
Blacksburg while I was putting myself
[SPEAKER_00]: through graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually taught horticulture and turf
and golf course design for actually 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years, not 17, 15 years in Western New
York, along with forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Don had mentioned my BS here in
ag education and my master's at Virginia
[SPEAKER_00]: Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I want to commend you
for being the first speaker in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: two years who has actually finished early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured we had to have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this was kind of off the beaten
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question actually more for Trevor
possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: To what degree did you see the
participants in your focus groups make a
[SPEAKER_01]: tie in between these individual extreme
weather events and the broader subject of
[SPEAKER_01]: global climate change?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kept climate change out of our
script.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't represent it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say it probably came up,
it wasn't in our focus group, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in around, let's say,
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I would say 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just brought it up of their own volition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were actively told to not use
the term climate change based on our
[SPEAKER_00]: funder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came up 50% of the time organically
as part of our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
