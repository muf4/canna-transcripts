[SPEAKER_00]: When you need your blade sharpened the
best thing to do is have a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: blades on hand so that you can take one
off and then put on the new blade and
[SPEAKER_00]: while that blade can be used for another 8
to 10 to 12 hours of use then you take the
[SPEAKER_00]: blade you took off to the local hardware
store and most of the local hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: stores should be able to put a nice edge
on you and it's important having a sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: blade not only keeps the plants healthy
but costs you less in fuel in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I like to do is grab a
piece of cardboard as something to lay
[SPEAKER_01]: down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much you try to clean your
concrete pad it's always going to be dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: and if that's a concern for you this makes
a nice surface to lay down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I like to keep with me when I'm
changing blades and when I'm taking them
[SPEAKER_01]: off is a welding glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick these up at your local
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large rag works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a glove because I can actually hold
on to the blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no chance of it slipping out of my
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're taking a blade off if you're
not holding on to it it's going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never want to use a socket to take a
blade off if you're not holding on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're laying on your back trying to
take a blade off sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: counterclockwise and clockwise becomes
confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is before I use my tool I'll
make sure that it's loosening up or
[SPEAKER_01]: tightening down depending on what I'm
doing and I'll set it beforehand so when I
[SPEAKER_01]: crawl underneath the machine I'm already
set up to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you take them out what I like to
do is just mark it right top on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever helps you put that blade back in
the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use the center block as
something to hold the top of the mower
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way you can access the blade safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember with these small rotary
mowers you don't want to leave them tipped
[SPEAKER_01]: back for very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas and oil can move on you and they'll
start spilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remove your blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move your tools to the side and lift up
your center block and set the mower back
[SPEAKER_01]: down until you're ready to put your blade
back on.
Thanks for watching.
