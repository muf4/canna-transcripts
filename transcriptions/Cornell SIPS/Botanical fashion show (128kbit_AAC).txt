[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, so you're here at the
first ever Botanical Fashion Show for a
[SPEAKER_05]: March with Art and Culture class.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three students have made designs to show
you all today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheila Gordon, Jasmine LeCouzier,
and Eva Johnson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I have my grass skirt on,
I'm Louis Rios, and this part of this
[SPEAKER_05]: skirt is designed with an asectium fox
tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's an annual form of this grass,
and then I've alternated the colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are the less ripe ones,
and these are the more ripe ones,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so that gives a design.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the background of this skirt is
detailed with prosomia, and this belt is
[SPEAKER_05]: also got the leaves of this grass,
and then on the background I have these
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we're ready for the girls
to
study.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jasmine recalled the blue polka dot dress
last worn in high school, perfect to work
[SPEAKER_05]: front.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the bodice was feathered with leaves
and moss sewn in, Jasmine carefully
[SPEAKER_05]: positioned the double layer of tulle
wrapped around the waist cover of the
[SPEAKER_05]: skirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was time to determine how best to match
the whimsical layer of the grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jasmine made the tie with these wires.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, the tulle was cut into strips and
thread through opening.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shoes and headpiece, which complement
the dress, for a total look.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look closely at the back of the
headpiece, you can notice a dream catcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dream catcher is made of lageris
ovatus, which is gold thread, amobia,
[SPEAKER_05]: and white feathers.
And that's a sad end.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tobacco plant, nicotinia, which
comprises the majority of the outfit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The banana plant, busco, is covered in the
cotton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Justyphium, charistrutum, and the coffee
plant, sophia or ravica, were intended to
[SPEAKER_05]: seem as though they were containing the
laborer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is almost as if the plants themselves
were constructing the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dependent are the laborers on these
crops for a day's wage that unfair labeled
[SPEAKER_05]: practices within the workplace can remain
unchallenged for some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bag is covered with arbor,
vieta leaves, and assenuated with compound
[SPEAKER_05]: cones and plants by her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, these are our three ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're going to have our guest have
Nina Bassett.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's in the horticulture department,
and she works with Men's Garden,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is where I got all my flowers from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a horticulture perspective,
we'll have Nina.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm very enjoying the fact that you
use grasses, which might seem to be
[SPEAKER_07]: gradual, but are quite tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's quite an improvement.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the whole composition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that oak leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're bleached oak leaves.
Bleached oak leaves.
Wow.
So you took oak leaves.
I didn't bleach them myself.
I ordered them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ordered them.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as progress was, you ordered
those as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that oak leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that oak leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the grasses were from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the ones I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: From Men's Garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like your crown is very whimsical,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your shoes are quite a complete package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Charlotte.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Charlotte from the textile
department.
[SPEAKER_05]: So clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like the composition very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Nina said, it's a complete mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the headwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the footwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all goes together nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the wedding theme,
it has a fresh look.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has almost a hint of innocence and hope
for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a perfect combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a hint of green in your
headdress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the green, the gradation of
greens is really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the mix of textures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oak leaves are really terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bringing out the texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that, next to the green that you
raised, is really terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really fun outfit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just going to have to take this
to greater heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have had the TV folks here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have video over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nicely done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was wondering if anyone in the class
had any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: The oak leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you turn them, like, where they
placed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're upright.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started around the main vein.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just did three little sewing sutures,
I guess, down the vein.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the leaves are already curled?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're dried.
[SPEAKER_06]: They naturally kind of curled up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which material did you find it most
difficult to work with?
[SPEAKER_06]: The grass, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I originally wanted to just glue
the grass onto the dress.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this grass is a lot thicker than the
one that I ever wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I ended up having to do was sew it
onto an individual piece of wire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then wrap bunches of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sew it onto the dress.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a lot more work than just
hockling it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was harder, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: What made you do the dream contract from
the back?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have so much leftover material from what
I ordered.
[SPEAKER_06]: And last night, I wanted to make one
because one of my best friends made one
[SPEAKER_06]: from my leftover material.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I looked up how to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I decided that it looked great with
the dress and all the same theme.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I added it in the back for a little fun
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were the grasses already curled?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they were straight.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were one of the straight bushes of
grass out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually got injured two weeks ago
and couldn't walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I needed space in my room so I
couldn't correctly dry them, flat on the
[SPEAKER_06]: floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they ended up drying in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: And kind of got the curly look,
which I ended up liking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any more questions?
Could you turn around?
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did the whole thing take?
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me the entire fall break and then
at least two to three hours a day since
[SPEAKER_06]: then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this permanent?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, once you take it off, are things
going to start falling off?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty permanent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it on three different times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is what's going to end up
staying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, everything's pretty much
preserved.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think it'll stay for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll work mine around for a chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was so interesting that you
chose to do a costume for workers who were
[SPEAKER_07]: being exploited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly don't remember why I thought to
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was walking by the banana plant
in the welcome center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wow, those leaves are really big and
they'll be really cool to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But next time I make a dress out of
plants, I won't make it out of leaves,
[SPEAKER_04]: though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it your idea for becoming an exploited
worker from South America?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that come to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was interesting working with
the materials because these tobacco leaves
[SPEAKER_04]: came from some family friends in Haiti.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I used to live in the Dominican
Republic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just talked to my friend one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was like, oh, what are you up to?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I have this really cool
horticulture project.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, you know, we still have an
optimization thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be up any.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're leaving me dry by the time they
get here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stayed pretty pliable for a couple
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were very pliable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just telling them that I was
trying this on this morning, making sure
[SPEAKER_04]: to bend my arms and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things were good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I brought it out into the
windstorm this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have cotton and tobacco and?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are coffee beans on the head wrap,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the banana leaves are what make the
head wrap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, the head wrap is a bin that
we made in class.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has natural plant-type stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really unusual theme and execution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it interesting, too, that you're
looking at cultural and social and
[SPEAKER_02]: political emphasis with your costume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, Closing in the Ages has done
that a bit in the days when women wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to present themselves as stronger figures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put shoulder pads in their suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you all have heard that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order to make a statement that
women were strong and they could handle
[SPEAKER_02]: these jobs like men and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's interesting that you're
carrying on that tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely not an artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started with research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought I wanted to just go with
something that I could learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also done a really good job of
creating the look of 18th century costume.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out looking ragtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, the leaves stretched across
the whole dress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything was covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looked a little fresher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that it's dried, I mean,
you can see the cloth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I had put more on, knowing that
they were going to dry up in a day,
[SPEAKER_04]: then it would be interesting to see what
it would look like more ragged and things
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the tobacco leaves actually
have a certain muster to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually, if you're at a distance,
it could look like satin or silk or
[SPEAKER_02]: weighted silk, that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting because the tobacco
leaves that I received in the mail,
[SPEAKER_04]: one side of them was a more golden
mustardy color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other side was a very deep,
almost purply brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a hard time deciding which one I
wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it ended up being that the leaves
curled a certain way that was conducive to
[SPEAKER_04]: pinning them onto the dress and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of them are the lighter tan color.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really liked the dark one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may be one of the few people in this
room who's actually worked in the tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know a lot about those leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was interested in the banana leaves,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you know that you can scrape
those banana leaves and get actual fibers,
[SPEAKER_04]: which then you can make into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really interesting, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's a very fascinating concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any questions from the class?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were curious about your source
of the tobacco leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you ordered them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I ordered them from, well,
it's my father's friend who lives in Port
[SPEAKER_04]: France, and a couple from my friend in
Santa Domingo.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of them are from the plantation
right outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just have a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I grew up in upstate New York,
my grandfather grew tobacco and hung it in
[SPEAKER_01]: his attic to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eve had this stored in my office this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, scent is so connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entering my grandparents' house was
really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pray for now that it was when we
received them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My room is completely stanched with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my RA came in the other day and was
like, are you rolling cigars?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded like he wanted to join,
but I was like, if you want, help me make
[SPEAKER_04]: a dress.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the banana leaves from?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually from here, from the
plantations, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of them are from a compost
bin, which someone who works in the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse, I don't know if you know where
the Arboretum is near, do you know where
[SPEAKER_04]: the Arboretum is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you go past the Welcome Center
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a greenhouse that was about to
compost a lot of banana leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had caught her at the exact right
time because the next day she was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be putting it in the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got some from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, that's where most of them
are from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an excursion getting them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had plans to bike there, and I had a
backpack to stuff them all in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got a flat, got my bike empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, all right, I have to meet
her in 15 minutes from West Campus,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I'm going to run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ran really fast and showed up
dripping sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I just was really excited
for the banana leaves.
So good stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that on the back of the dress
you have to put a label, though,
[SPEAKER_02]: that mentions the flammability.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you had done a lot of research
before you started designing the dress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just wondering why you picked
this specific time period.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first thing that triggered it
was, the banana leaves outside of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcoming Center, like I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was on and around with one of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she is Colombian and was talking about
coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her grandparents are harvesting coffee
beans or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started talking about how the
store, Banana Republic, is not the first
[SPEAKER_04]: time that term has been used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Banana Republic was really light
started in referring to Guatemalan unfair
[SPEAKER_04]: trade practices and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a big business there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it was just a mixture of
her and I going by the banana plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we walked by Banana Republic and
stayed at the mall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, that'd be kind of
weird to do a dress like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tired of having better answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you guys very much.
Thank you.
I think it's such a great idea to be the
queen.
We have to do this kind of wave.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you did this.
It's sort of like almost not moving your
wrist.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was the bag, the hat.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was five things, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now six, actually, because of the
dress also.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was the bag, the gloves,
the hat, shoes, and the necklace.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the leaves were mostly hemlock?
[SPEAKER_03]: On the dress and the handbag, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That must have been difficult to glue them
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I glue on everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's pretty small leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it's totally covered.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are these leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was part of it as well?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there must be something under there
that you glued it onto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the dress itself, and then I glued
them onto the dress.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was looking very different from this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the maple leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a nice little color.
[SPEAKER_07]: The queen tends to be kind of
monochromatic.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's always like blue pastel or pink
pastel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if we can call this a
queen eating her salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks green to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, it's a tremendous amount
of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that all those beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we usually have beans in the necklace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those wired on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them on, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: The necklace itself came from the hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hat came with some cords around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I initially wanted to do a malleable
hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wouldn't work over the hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just took the cords off the hat,
and then just put the moss around it,
[SPEAKER_03]: glued it on, and then glued the beans onto
it, and did some multi-colored beans on
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hat, that's the moss, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually looks like a lot of the
other materials that we use every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like polar fleece, even,
that's made from the soda bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also a wool felt, so that you
could take the wool fibers and by adding
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture and agitation and heat,
then you get this felted fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what your hat looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really achieve the look of the
material that people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're using something really
creative and innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that feather thing in your hat?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dried white pine needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually sewed it onto the hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sewed it on, and then I put the beans
over it to hide it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sewed the needles on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I sewed the needles onto the hat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really just like five needles,
and you just sew it in place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I gather the needles in a bundle,
and then I put them onto the hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just run the needle and thread
through the hat a few times, tap them on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just make a pattern on very
little beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use some really interesting
structures, too, on your handbag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that twining or braiding that goes
around the light color?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plant fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made some stuff in class.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked the professor for some
leftovers that she had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that raffia?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just plaited them and put them around
there and got some hemlock combs and just
[SPEAKER_03]: made a pattern around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the contrast of the textures that
you get by the different techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the moss looks like a non-mobin fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got what looks like
twining or braiding around the purse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the flat application that we
might do when we're applying anything on
[SPEAKER_02]: the garment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really mix the textures and the
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very creative and innovative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And does the class have any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get the gloves on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I started with this one first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just kind of aged my way on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird, because when I was doing it at
home, I knew I got this one right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for some reason, I thought I had
this one right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I just put it on, I realized that
this was not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you from the UK by any chance?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jamaica was once colonized by England.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just popped in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you familiar with the phrase pearly
queen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cherry thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And men and women dress up in these
clothes that are covered with pearls and
[SPEAKER_00]: beads and beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a UK tradition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went online and actually looked up
some pictures of Queen Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being colonized by England,
I already know that she has a glove thing
[SPEAKER_03]: going in the necklace.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I knew that she wore a variety of
hats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they were really broad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they were like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just chose this one and made it look
like her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you get all the different
materials from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you collect a lot from yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was painstakingly hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these materials are from the property,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great gentleman by the name of
Phil who actually helped me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took me to the sources and actually
showed me where they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on Null Drive or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right just below BB Hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a plantation here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to go there and cut and cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my shoes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I sprayed the blue on there and
then, well, this was probably,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I sat up the other morning
on some probably like almost three o
[SPEAKER_03]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went down to the garden and I picked
some hemlocks, like branches of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I came home and stripped them
off, like on the little tiny hemlock where
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys actually strip them off and do a
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to bed like three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I woke up the next day and I sprayed
the blue on and then just sprinkled the
[SPEAKER_03]: hemlock leaves over and then just put some
corns along the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the S?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's supposed to be a brooch because
we don't always wear a brooch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just put mine because it's S for me
and Sheila.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you make the S out of a hemlock
cone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's hemlock cones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing as the ones around my
shoes.
Well, another round of applause.
