[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sarah and I'm going to talk
about preliminary results today for a
[SPEAKER_00]: multivariate genomic wide association
study for carotenoids and dry matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are two negatively correlated traits
in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably know that cassava is a
really important food security crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds over 800 million people globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really important source of
calories, mostly through carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's pretty low in micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so populations that rely heavily on
cassava-based diets often have high rates
[SPEAKER_00]: of vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin
A deficiency, which affects one in four
[SPEAKER_00]: children in Sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some yellow cassava varieties
that accumulate carotenoids, some of which
[SPEAKER_00]: are cleaved in the human body to form
vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're called pro-vitamin A
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about yellow cassava is
that it can provide a sustainable source
[SPEAKER_00]: of pro-vitamin A for people in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, breeders have been
investing over the last 20 years in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding improved varieties of yellow
cassava that can provide pro-vitamin A and
[SPEAKER_00]: meet other agronomic trait needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there is a trade-off
between carotenoids and dry matter
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry matter content, I'll abbreviate DM,
throughout this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really important driver of consumer
acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It influences the dry yields for flour and
also the textural properties of cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the key traits to target
for improving for yellow cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this negative correlation, it's been
persistent in the African breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, and that's been a problem for
producing high dry matter varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: also have high carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous GWAS studies have identified that
there's a locus on chromosome 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is associated with both carotenoids
measured here by a chromometer and also
[SPEAKER_00]: dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a strong candidate gene
at this locus for both carotenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is phytoin synthase 2, the key
rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis, and also sucrose synthase,
a separate candidate gene that's likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence dry matter content, it's thought
that this locus represents a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: linkage between these two genes,
and that's driving the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been molecular studies
looking at the transgenic expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: PSY2 that suggests it has a pleiotropic
effect on both carotenoids and dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bit of conflicting evidence
in cassava for whether linkage or
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropy is driving this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objective of most of my research
is trying to understand the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between carotenoids and dry
matter and implications for developing
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding strategies that can help us
increase both carotenoids and dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few different hypotheses
about how these traits are related,
[SPEAKER_00]: both at the chromosome 1 locus or
genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first for linkage, it's the idea that
there are two separate loci that are
[SPEAKER_00]: closely spaced together that separately
affect carotenoids and dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could also be horizontal pleiotropy
or biological pleiotropy where a single
[SPEAKER_00]: locus affects both carotenoids and dry
matter directly or mediated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there could be vertical
pleiotropy where a single locus affects
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids, which then, because of
physiological connections, affects dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so testing which of these
relationships fits at chromosome 1 is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we think that it might be vertical
pleiotropy, which seems more likely than
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal pleiotropy in this case,
we'd also expect that other loci that
[SPEAKER_00]: affect carotenoids genome-wide would have
a similar association with dry matter if
[SPEAKER_00]: they do have an inherent trait
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this study, we're doing a
multivariate genome-wide association study
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at loci genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a multivariate analysis,
we can increase statistical power by
[SPEAKER_00]: taking advantage of the correlation
between traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also test hypotheses about the
distribution of jointly associated loci
[SPEAKER_00]: across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to know if there are multiple
loci that are jointly associated with both
[SPEAKER_00]: traits besides just the chromosome 1 locus
that we already know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, whether those jointly
associated loci affect the traits in
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite directions, more often than
expected by chance, which would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is an inherent relationship
between the two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this study, we genotyped 378
accessions sampled from the yellow cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding population at the International
Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Ibad
[SPEAKER_00]: in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Elizabeth Parks is the breeder who
has been working in that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have, together with her team
there, they have collected child data over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last several years, which include
carotenoids measured by spectrometer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a quantitative method that's
improved from previous color chart methods
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more qualitative and also dry
matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this data, we are using two
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is a multivariate linear model,
which is more of a traditional GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is a Bayesian model
comparison, which is going to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret the results of these
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first method, for the
multivariate linear mixed models,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing a two-step approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we calculate blups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we test associations between SNPs
and blups, accounting for relatedness,
[SPEAKER_00]: population structure, and the major effect
locus on chromosome 1 that we already know
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the linear model, the first
step looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we account for trial effects and
calculate blups using boxcox transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that they're normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take those blups and put them
in an association model where we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to the effect of the SNP,
we're also accounting for genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships, also the relationships of
the haplotypes at the PSY2 locus and the
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypes at a region in chromosome 1
where there are integration diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: markers, or IDMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are tagging a haplotype that
causes a lot of population structure on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 1 and is also known to affect
dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we account for those effects so that we
can try and reduce confounding from
[SPEAKER_00]: population structure and also identify
loci other than the major effect that we
[SPEAKER_00]: already know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this Manhattan plot, there's the
negative log 10p values from those
[SPEAKER_00]: associations on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cutoff here, the dotted line,
represents a modified Bonferroni cutoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is calculated with alpha of 0.05 and
the estimated number of effective SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are multiple
peaks above this significance threshold,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just on chromosome 1, which suggests
there are joint associations in other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the genome as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's challenging about this more
traditional multivariate GWAS approach is
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you have a single p-value for
these associations, it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret whether that SNP is associated
because it affects both traits jointly,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it really just affects one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: These associations can represent strong
associations with carotenoids and or dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it's a very strong association
with one trait, it might get picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to help us interpret this, we're using
a method by Matthew Stevens called
[SPEAKER_00]: multivariate Bayesian imputation-based
association mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind this approach is to
compare models that bin the two phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: into these three possible partitions that
are directly associated with the SNP,
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly associated with the SNP via
correlation with the other trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: or unassociated with the SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it calculates probability for each
of these possible partitions and a Bayes
[SPEAKER_00]: factor, which represents the support for a
particular partition compared with the
[SPEAKER_00]: null, which would be that neither trait is
associated with a given SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then how this looks in practice,
because the Stevens algorithm doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to fit covariates, we have to do
it in two steps again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is similar to the
previous model I showed, where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for the effect of the PSY2
haplotype, the chromosome one
[SPEAKER_00]: introgression, and also the rest of the
genome relationships using a leave one
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome out approach, where we're
taking the residuals from this model for
[SPEAKER_00]: which one chromosome has been left out,
and then fitting that with the SNPs on
[SPEAKER_00]: that chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which were left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for each SNP, we can then see which
partition has the highest Bayes factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: representing which model fits the data the
best in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this figure, it's the same Manhattan
plot I showed earlier from the
[SPEAKER_00]: multivariate linear mixed models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the color that's overlaid on top is
representing the top Bayes factor that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of the BIMBAM approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in red are SNPs, which their highest
Bayes factor was corresponding to the
[SPEAKER_00]: direct direct partition, which is that the
SNP is directly associated with both
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids and dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a peak that's in green,
which represents the partition where the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP is directly associated with
carotenoids and indirectly associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you account for the effect of
carotenoids, there's no residual effect
[SPEAKER_00]: for dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also look at the effect direction
of these SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in red are SNPs that their effect
estimate for carotenoids and dry matter
[SPEAKER_00]: are in opposite directions, and the blue
color is for the same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that all of the SNPs which
fall above the significance threshold are
[SPEAKER_00]: in red, which means that they affect the
traits in opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, it looks like we have
significantly associated loci that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: both carotenoids and dry matter in
opposite directions that are across the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, not just on chromosome one,
which suggests that there's a genome wide
[SPEAKER_00]: negative relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direct direct model fits best for most
of the jointly associated loci except for
[SPEAKER_00]: the one on chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's still a peak on
chromosome one, even after accounting for
[SPEAKER_00]: the PSY2 haplotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that there might be
multiple causal loci in that region on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our next steps are to evaluate
candidate genes and follow up on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pleiotropy hypotheses using other
methods like a network analysis that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my committee and the
IATA Kusaba breeding unit team who
[SPEAKER_00]: collected this field data over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Led by Dr. Parks and Dr. Gabby Emponjo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of some of my lab
mates at the next GenKusaba conference
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if it's possible to get
access to data on ABA if it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: a pan carotenoid thing shuttling how much
gets into ABA that would, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just waited a million months for
this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed was asking if it's possible to get ABA
abscisic acid data, which is downstream of
[SPEAKER_00]: beta carotene and is one of the possible
mechanisms for which carotenoid pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: might affect the dry matter and starch
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have large data sets on that,
but the data that there are for where
[SPEAKER_00]: abscisic acid is measured shows that
there's a positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Association between total carotene content
and abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with lower dry matter, so the
correlations support that idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very hard to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think test abscisic acid in a high
throughput manner, although Tim Sutter may
[SPEAKER_00]: have different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the starch, there's two starch
biosynthesis genes near PSY2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome one that have been hypothesized
as candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is sucrose synthase,
which.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is bidirectional in converting sucrose
into starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another enzyme called UDP
glucose pyrophosphorylase that's involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in the starch pathway, and those are both
really close to the vitamin synthase two
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either of them are likely candidate
genes to affect starch synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there have been no variants tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those genes that are potentially
causal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thanks for your answer,
Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, just want to clarify the definition
from the vertical phleotropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean sequential?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question was clarifying
vertical phleotropy.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, so for horizontal phleotropy or
biological phleotropy, the idea is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variant like phytoin synthase two has a
direct effect on dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which in this case is kind of hard to
imagine, but there's other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cases in which it might be possible to
find a gene like a transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that has direct effects on multiple
separate traits for vertical phleotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that there's a single variant,
for example, in PSY2 that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids, which we know it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because carotenoids might affect
dry matter, for example, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid connection that Ed mentioned,
then that variant would also affect dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, but only via its effect on
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you account for the effect of
the SNP on carotenoids, there's no more
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on dry matter separate from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe simplify it to say horizontal is
more like a parallel and the vertical is
[SPEAKER_03]: more like a sequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, horizontal is like parallel,
vertical is like sequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, we can pass it to the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, many of you already know that
much of my research has to do with gourds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'm going to specifically focus
on bottle gourds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of my research, I'm characterizing
USDA legendary collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so first I want to talk about the
area I'm focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of my work is dealing with
Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of discussion on how to
define Southeast Asia as a region by
[SPEAKER_01]: scholars, whether it really should be its
own region, whether we should think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of between regions as a connector.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for my purposes, we're going to talk
about Southeast Asia in these 11
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, mostly focusing on mainland
Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand,
Myanmar and Laos, but a little bit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines, and also in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why bottle gourds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, bottle gourds are really
interesting because it's believed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first domesticated crops in the
entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe part of this is due its
duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottle gourds are quite unique because
you can eat the leaves, you can eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, you can eat the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the fruit matures and the plant
senesces, it has a very thick rind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this rind can be used for many
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, traditionally, if you might have some
familiar with bottle gourds, the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common thing to think about is its use for
holding water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might think of a bottle gourd
something like this, where we might cut a
[SPEAKER_01]: hole in the spout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might cut a hole in the side to allow
air to come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would use this as a drinking
vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some show and tell, so I'm going
to pass some things around for you guys to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at the history of bottle
gourds in Southeast Asia, it's quite
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse the different uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my video's not going to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the uses you see across
especially mainland Southeast Asia is its
[SPEAKER_01]: use of musical instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most countries, you can find these
instruments by different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have classification such as the
zither.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is you have this long stick
that has strings attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be maybe one string.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be up to six to eight strings,
depending on the country of origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the really important thing in most
gourd instruments is that it acts as a
[SPEAKER_01]: resonator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of instruments actually come
from gourds originally, so things like
[SPEAKER_01]: banjos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these Vietnamese lutes played by
these thai women, where the base of the
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument is the gourd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also can be used kind of as an
amplifier with the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of the zither here,
we're going to use our imaginations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if this is my gourd resonator,
I can hold this to my chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be cut in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I play it, this will act as a
resonator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also my chest is a resonator to
increase the volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we have electronics in the
pre-modern era, or playing musical
[SPEAKER_01]: instruments, gourds are our natural
amplifiers so we can play to a large
[SPEAKER_01]: audience and everyone can hear us.
[SPEAKER_01]: A second use that you might think of
gourds being used as is garments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two of the more common examples is in
the Philippines, these Taubungal hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in West Papua as kotika.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be a common gourd you might
use for these traditional Filipino hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, again, you cut these in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd braid up some reed to act as a soft
interior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on where you're going to
wear it, you might just keep it plain and
[SPEAKER_01]: use some sort of resin to preserve it and
wear out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're going to wear this for a
special occasion, you might carve into it
[SPEAKER_01]: great designs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might paint it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, a lot of times due to
imperial powers in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asian countries to be colonized,
many of these practices are dying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this Filipino man, Teofilo Garcia,
he is one of the last people actually
[SPEAKER_01]: making these hats in all of the
Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the use of the kotika in
West Papua.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important culturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the traditional garment that men
will wear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might use something like this to make
your kotika.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the shape you want,
which correlates to tribal identity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may keep it curled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably don't want it this curled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, you might wrap this around
a log.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want it straight, you would tie a
small rock to the end so it grows
[SPEAKER_01]: straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you get your desired shape,
you are going to harvest your gourd,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on coals, gut it out, and then you
let it smoke in the roof of the men's
[SPEAKER_01]: house until it's preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, you might decorate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are these kanok warriors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this one has a braided rattan
covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's a little bit more simple in
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: People might put furs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might paint them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is for use whether you're
at a festival versus working out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is also the tribal
identity, as I said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another place we see gourds is as
amulets and as relics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this photo here is one I actually took
in Thailand when I was visiting a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: that grows bala gourds, which there they
called namtao.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seen as a sort of protector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at each corner of their house,
they actually had one of these gourds
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's supposed to kind of ward out evil
into their farm and keep their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: growing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although this is not part of Southeast
Asia, there are also a lot of Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: communities that over the centuries have
come to live in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many of the Chinatowns and other
communities, you can find these,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially near New Year's, where in
China, from what I was told by the ladies,
[SPEAKER_01]: is typically bala gourds are meant to
bring good fortune to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might hang a bala gourd in your
house or in a cart to bring your family
[SPEAKER_01]: more money for the New Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way that bala gourds are in
Southeast Asia, sort of this religious
[SPEAKER_01]: folklore area, is in these people of the
gourds stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this idea that mostly mainland
Southeast Asia, that people actually came
[SPEAKER_01]: from the gourds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on how the people exited the
gourds, says something about the social
[SPEAKER_01]: ranking of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one mythology, the gourd is pierced
toward twice, once just kind of drilled
[SPEAKER_01]: and once with a hot iron rod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the side that's just drilled,
come people of lighter complexion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the side that's charred,
come people with darker complexion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this and the way they come out,
kind of talks about how people are viewed
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these myths change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some of the older versions,
you see more traditional communities of
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Named, and once you get into more modern
eras, you might start to see Americans and
[SPEAKER_01]: French and other people being added into
the stories as people from different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries come into Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another place is in architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have the Baipuja Pagoda in
Myanmar, and also Wat Kutau in Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides the architecture, you can also
see these shapes in a lot of pottery as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can use some of your
imagination, a bottle gourd, something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this might have inspired this lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe something like this would be the
inspiration for the Baipuja Pagoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you look across Southeast Asia,
you can start to see all these
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities to the bottle gourd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm telling you all these historical
uses of bottle gourds, but what does this
[SPEAKER_01]: really have to do with plant breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when plant breeding is defined,
we also think about things about
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing positive genetic traits,
higher production, resistance to pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens, and drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what does plant breeding really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I'd like everybody to do at
the end of this presentation is take out a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of paper and write down your
definition of plant breeding and think
[SPEAKER_01]: about what plant breeding really means to
each of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I read some of these
definitions that tend to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: technical, it's not quite how I envision
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think about plant breeding,
I feel like the missing link in some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these definitions is the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, having resistance to diseases,
drought tolerance does help people in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way, but it doesn't really think
holistically about how that those changes
[SPEAKER_01]: change the systems they go into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I've been characterizing the USDA
bottle gourd collection and taking some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these coursework in Southeast Asia
history, it's really changed my
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective of how I think about plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give a few examples of things
I've started thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one is thinking about how gene flow and
bottlenecks mimics how this crop has been
[SPEAKER_01]: transported to different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we look at some of these trade routes
between countries in Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to Africa, to China, to Europe,
and see how these crops are moving and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe see points of genetic diversity or
mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing with characterizing is some
of these uses have phenotypes that we
[SPEAKER_01]: might not first think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a gourd as a resonator, well,
what makes a good resonator is a phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: that we should be capturing that's
important to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something I probably would have
thought of firsthand, but there's all
[SPEAKER_01]: these traits that may be very important to
these communities culturally that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not capturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't capture them in the germplasm
diversity, there's a potential that these
[SPEAKER_01]: traits will no longer exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here thinking again about culture,
and a lot of these can kind of relate into
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously we think most about food,
but thinking about folk art and
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrations, that's maybe not something
we first think about in plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these things are really important to
different communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, thank you for listening to
my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you guys have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Trev.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea for how much of the gourd in the
entrance, let's say, are characterized
[SPEAKER_04]: already in combination with this thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say some majority still remains to
be characterized?
[SPEAKER_04]: So,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can only speak to what the USDA
has, because that's what I've mostly been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of phenotypes present,
and there is about 174 accessions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: currently available that we used in the
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess one of the benefits,
slash some of the hard things working
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes with the USDA germplasm,
is it's not always uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it, the accessions are a
little bit more like populations than they
[SPEAKER_01]: are like a breeding line or a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think because of that, we're
capturing a lot more of the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's still, like,
we only had one or two accessions from
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we still capture some of that
diversity we see in Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know if maybe there's
different mutations that are causing maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the same trait that we're not capturing
looking at like the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm trying to do is start
looking at germplasm collections in other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries and think about maybe capturing
the genetic diversity and working with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess that's kind of my concern is
there's definitely certain countries that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, like, very represented and ones that
have very low representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if you don't have it,
you don't know what's really there and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really something different or if it's
really the same as what is it from these
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you can talk pretty much about
using it for fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fishing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as a Bob in ANS.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was thinking archeology many,
many years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what the argument was to reuse
this early scientific fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still a whole, you know,
this is not homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I wrote the paper related to this
talk for my class, I didn't really get
[SPEAKER_01]: anything for fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as Southeast Asia, I have heard
about using them in bobbers and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: people still do quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that might just be
like the sources I was able to access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could like look at more
archives, but I only speak a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if I was able to kind of go
into those archives and look more,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be able to find a much larger
diversity of their uses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I think about a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the collection comes from
Africa, I believe, Zimbabwe, and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's kind of a smattering of
things from the Middle East, a couple from
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia, and a few from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the World Vegetable Center has
quite a few quite a few accessions from
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a potential that that area is
maybe a little bit more covered,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just not in USDA context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other countries, I'm not so sure of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is use of bog words on every
single continent, except for maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not into the grias I think it's used
in Africa and through Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested in doing exploration,
especially to see what farmers are still
[SPEAKER_01]: currently using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, from my experience trying
to submit plant exploration proposals,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the really big barriers is they
want you to have experience going a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: exploration, but there's very few people
left who have gone these explorations and
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to continue doing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that's kind of the big
barrier right now for doing some more
[SPEAKER_01]: collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think just doing some more work
figuring out what maybe smaller collection
[SPEAKER_01]: exists may not need to actually do a plant
exploration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wondering, your seminar is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me a little bit of like last
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very diverse at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering, for your dissertation,
what do you see other chapters of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vision over our scope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still kind of debating how I want
to split my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the work I'm doing,
I want to create a formal crop
[SPEAKER_01]: characterization guide for bottle gourds
because there are no formal crop
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I've been going through previous
studies that look at bottle gourds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really hard to tell whether this
shape is really the same shape where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking about something slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that that will be a chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the USDA collection, we took leaf
tissue samples for Darseq.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hoping to look at allele frequency and
hopefully run a GWAS as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third chapter is a little bit up in
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of would like to talk about some of
the cultural aspects of this because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's a really important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to do a lot of research
looking at the care and fair principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe trying to write something
talking about this project and those
[SPEAKER_01]: principles and thinking about
characterizing these more traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the introduction,
Charlie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, I am Savannah Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am from Mike Moore and Joyce Van
Exelabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, I'm going to be telling you
about some work that I've been doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: adapting a practical haplotype graph for
imputation in sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of to give you some background,
on this work, low vitamin intake is a
[SPEAKER_02]: modern food challenge in the USA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by low vitamin intake, I don't mean
clinical levels of low vitamin intake,
[SPEAKER_02]: but sub-recommended levels of vitamin
intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few compounds that we're really
interested in in sweet corn are provitamin
[SPEAKER_02]: A carotenoids, antioxidant carotenoids,
and vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_02]: And vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these compounds, when you don't get
enough of these in your diet, what can
[SPEAKER_02]: happen is you can have increased risks of
conditions such as blindness, maternal
[SPEAKER_02]: mortality, or increased risk of
cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sweet corn offers a great opportunity
for addressing some of these issues
[SPEAKER_02]: because sweet corn is a very popularly
consumed vegetable in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of 2019, it was the sixth most consumed
vegetable, according to the USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has natural variation for
these fresh kernel nutrient quality
[SPEAKER_02]: traits, including vitamin E and
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So previous work that has been done in the
Gore lab has used a sweet corn and bread
[SPEAKER_02]: association, and breadline association
panel that was created by Bill Tracy and
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Visagio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was used to identify inbred lines
that had desirable alleles for genes that
[SPEAKER_02]: we know contribute to these fresh kernel
nutritional quality traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after we selected these inbred lines
with desirable alleles, what we did was
[SPEAKER_02]: created F1 bi-parental populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from here, for the rest of our
breeding pipeline, we are selfing these to
[SPEAKER_02]: the F5 generation, at which point we will
conduct yield and quality testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: generate high-vitamin inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as every plant breeder knows,
we are constrained by time and space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want to do to speed up this
pipeline is integrate marker-based
[SPEAKER_02]: selection in early generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep in mind these will be highly
heterozygous, individuals that we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: perform the selection in, ideally our F2
generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this necessitates a method for
efficient genotype imputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where the practical haplotype
graph, which was created in the Buckler
[SPEAKER_02]: lab, comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be used to accurately impute
genotypes from SCIM sequence data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to give you a very, very brief
overview of a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had more time to go into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: is when we say graph, this is what we mean
by the graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a graph of different consensus
sequences that have been created from a
[SPEAKER_02]: starting panel, in this case a pangenome
of different maze accessions for each
[SPEAKER_02]: region in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number of regions is variable
depending on who creates the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: and also what the end user wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way this works is we would start
out with our reference genome here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for maze, this would be something like
B73.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a low coverage whole genome
sequence genome, this would be the
[SPEAKER_02]: accession that we want to impute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reference, we would align this to
the reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: This reference genome is the same
reference genome that was used to create
[SPEAKER_02]: the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is we split our low
coverage or SCIM sequencing data into the
[SPEAKER_02]: same regions that the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: includes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can actually compare each
region where we have known data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be the orange block,
the green block, and the blue block.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can compare these to our Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say this is, okay, this is most similar to
the orange block in the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green block is most similar to the
green block, the green consensus sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the blue block is the same as this
blue consensus sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have this area of missing data here
in our SCIM sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we want to do is use the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: to predict or impute what this missing
data is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: uses this graph of consensus sequences and
uses a hidden Markov model and a Vitterbi
[SPEAKER_02]: algorithm to actually predict the most
likely path through these consensus
[SPEAKER_02]: sequences to then predict, okay,
this is the most likely haplotype that we
[SPEAKER_02]: see in this region where we're missing
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we can fill in the blanks,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the use of a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: raises a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the biggest one is,
does the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're using need to include your
population founders?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the big question for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with the Buckler Lab
using their Mays pangenome Ph.D.,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this doesn't include any of my sweet
corn population founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there enough genetic representation
in it to perform imputation in my
[SPEAKER_02]: population?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm starting out with is I have
nine sweet corn and bread founders,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I have 72x WGS data for.
[SPEAKER_02]: My four bi-parental populations of about
200 individuals each, which I have 0.8x
[SPEAKER_02]: WGS data for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have this control IA 453 line
from the Rezende Lab, which I have 22x WGS
[SPEAKER_02]: data for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I, like I said, I'm using an
existing Mays pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Buckler Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to impute genotypes for my
populations at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I need to test if this Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: has enough genetic representation to
accurately impute genotypes in my F2
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start with, I am using this method
this pipeline that I have here to input my
[SPEAKER_02]: nine inbred sweet corn founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not doing anything with my F2s at
this point, just to clarify, as well as my
[SPEAKER_02]: control line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is very high coverage whole
genome sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I aligned it to the Mays pangenome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my reference genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm using the existing Mays
pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: to predict haplotype paths or impute
genotypes for my founders and my control
[SPEAKER_02]: line here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this IA 453 is my control line because
it is one of the three sweet corn
[SPEAKER_02]: accessions that were used to create the
pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideally, it would perform better than
any of my lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I have these predicted haplotype
paths, I'm converting them into
[SPEAKER_02]: pseudo-references, which is a term that Ed
very wonderfully gave to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed, if you're still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then aligning these pseudo-references,
which is basically just a FASTA of my
[SPEAKER_02]: predicted genomes for each of these lines,
to the actual sequence data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm calling variance from those
alignments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this is doing is allowing me to
look at the differences between the
[SPEAKER_02]: predicted sequence and the actual
sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the imputation works perfectly,
I would expect there to be no difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between my actual data and my imputed
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can more realistically expect
is that in my pseudo-reference,
[SPEAKER_02]: the imputed founder sequence, there will
be gaps or missed calls in the sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did, I ran the pipeline that
I've shared with you so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I looked at the number of SNPs
that were called.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the number of variance
between the actual and imputed sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And got a lot of information, but we're
still working on how to really interpret
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to draw your attention
specifically to I subsectioned out this
[SPEAKER_02]: graph and converted it to show SNP
percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this y-axis, I have SNP rate,
or percentage of SNPs, of all base pairs
[SPEAKER_02]: that were imputed, how many are imputed
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is ranging from a little under
0.0006% up to 0.0017% incorrect
[SPEAKER_02]: imputations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would also like to point out this IA
453, again, is my control line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I expected to perform the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're interpreting these,
we want them to all be 0.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything should be 0 in this graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was a perfect imputation,
that's not what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also seeing my control line did
not perform as well as I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: expected it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hypothesized that this could be due
to the representation of sweet corn that
[SPEAKER_02]: is in the pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particularly, so here's my control line,
which, again, is one of the sweet corn
[SPEAKER_02]: lines that were made used to create the
pangenome Ph.D., along with P39 and IL14H.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would have expected is that FA56A,
which is my founder that performed the
[SPEAKER_02]: best out of everything, would be more
closely related to one of the sweet corn
[SPEAKER_02]: lines that was used to create the
pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not what I'm seeing based on
this phylogenetic tree that was created by
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent Calantonio, formerly of the Risen
Day Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Vincent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm doing now, I've showed you
this pipeline and just a few of my results
[SPEAKER_02]: from my work so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am actually adding that information
from I use the variance, so those
[SPEAKER_02]: differences or miscalled SNPs,
between my imputed and my actual
[SPEAKER_02]: sequences, added that information back
into the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have an updated pangenome Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: with information from my sweet corn
founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm performing the same steps again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I would expect to see is,
this is what we saw before, where I have
[SPEAKER_02]: these pseudo references, where I have gaps
and mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect to still see some mistakes
in the new imputation that I'm generating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fewer, because the Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: database has been updated with new
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I have not completed this
at this stage, so you guys will have to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay tuned for later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the eventual goal is to then use the
existing Ph.D., an updated version of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ph.D., as well as another very commonly
used method of imputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And compare these and their imputation
accuracy in my F2 progeny sequences,
[SPEAKER_02]: my SCIM sequence data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I would like to thank the
Gore lab, the Rizende lab, the Buckler
[SPEAKER_02]: lab, especially for all of their help with
this work, and all of my funding sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will take any questions at this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Travis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, am I looking at
distributions of error rates, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: they're occurring in genic regions or
intergenic regions?
[SPEAKER_02]: What regions of the genome are we seeing
the most error and imputation in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be doing that, but I have not done
that so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question,
because if the errors are occurring in
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly intergenic regions, it might not
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very good point for Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: users, is how much accuracy do you
actually need to be able to get the data
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need for your project?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question that I want to answer
with my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, especially in my case,
we know if we have some particular loci
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're interested in, if we have good
imputation in those loci, then we're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably OK to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Ed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I wonder if at the chromosomal
scale, it'd be very interesting to keep a
[SPEAKER_04]: variant error in the cluster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think there's a lot of hidden
markup models.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were reading the genome in FADMAP,
we'd probably go off the rails.
And it's a good evidence from the cluster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ed, which, again, is supporting
what Travis said, that looking at where
[SPEAKER_02]: these mistakes are occurring is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if these are occurring in rare
alleles, which this is also a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: point, because part of this is if you are
really looking at rare alleles,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you want to have a low error rate in
your rare alleles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in particular, that's important when
you're looking at very highly heterozygous
[SPEAKER_02]: lines, like I am as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
