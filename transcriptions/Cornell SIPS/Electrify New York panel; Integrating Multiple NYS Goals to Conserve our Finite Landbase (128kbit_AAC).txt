[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is recording well online.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a conceptual panel for the live
hands-on energy expo that happens tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the Ag Quad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're featuring today is about
electrifying New York, how efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: electrification opportunities are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing about efficiency and
electrification is it improves air
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, it reduces greenhouse gases,
and it conserves New York State's natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the idea behind this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's to also in conjunction with the
Climate Leadership and Community
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection Act or the CLCPA in 2019 to
reduce our emissions 40% by 2030 and 85%
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only an umbrella policy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a goal planning policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of other little policies that
need to be built up underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all need to start thinking about
what kinds of policies we want to build
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hear about one such idea later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give us a sense on how much we are
emitting as a state, the gross emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2020, well, the New York State emitted
350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalents in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notably, it was 15% lower than 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of our work is already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here where our current
levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 15% below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I want to stress here is even
though my specialty is in this orange bar
[SPEAKER_00]: for agriculture, the blue bar is what we
all need to tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our energy consumption in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of our emissions come from the
building sector and the transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the theme today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we take care of this majority of
emissions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this in our community means we have
improved air quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower asthma, lower particulate matter,
lower cancer, lower greenhouse gases and
[SPEAKER_00]: lower extreme weather events, lower
insurance and future crises, lower
[SPEAKER_00]: instability for farmers who depend on the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notably, if we reduce our energy
demand, we also reduce our demand on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rural landscapes to support renewable
energy projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, this morning, we heard
from our colleagues, Ted Koch and Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: Woodbury, that we need about 75 to 125,000
hectares to meet our solar goals in 2050,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything we do to reduce our energy
consumption also helps our land base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just talk some words because
I realize decarbonization is very familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just means reducing or eliminating
carbon from the fossil fuel emissions from
[SPEAKER_00]: a sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be from any sector like
transportation, buildings or power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrification means replacing
technologies that run on fossil fuels with
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives that run more efficiently on
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means generating all that
electricity from clean energy rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: fossil fuels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a key point because whenever
you think about electrification,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be made from a fossil fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to connect that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weatherization, home improvements that
reduce energy use and make homes more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These include things like moisture
control, air sealing, ventilation,
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrades to insulation doors and windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now want to segue to the role of
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: When extension was made in the 1800s,
64% of our workforce was in farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, only 10% of our workforce is in
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet everything we do as urban or rural
citizens to reduce our greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions helps current and future farmers
have a more stable environment to grow our
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current and future citizens have less
damage to homes and shared infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: and our land bases can serve for other
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing our community emissions is
defense for agriculture and forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that everybody in this
room can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want us to look at the
cooperative extension passage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith-Lever Act in 1914 and see how much
it resonates in 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperative agricultural extension work
shall consist of the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: practical applications of research
knowledge, instruction and practical
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations of existing or improved
practices and technologies in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: uses of solar energy in 1914 with respect
to agriculture, home economics and rural
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think this is really key,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our landscape has changed,
but our mission to work on behalf of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for some reference, I love showing
this rural electrification administration
[SPEAKER_00]: posters from 1937, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were looking to electrify then,
how can we make posters that make these
[SPEAKER_00]: things palpable today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we brand efficiency and
electrification for our century?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't able to get Stephen Winter
Associates to come and talk about their
[SPEAKER_00]: multifamily retrofit playbooks,
but I recommend them for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different typologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to focus on a post-war four
to seven stories because that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment building in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find these at beexchange.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these do is they target several
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, the building envelope,
ventilation, heating, cooling and hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then break down the proportion of
energy by heating and hot water,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some other smaller
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this helps you start honing in on
where your energy use is and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: probably where your greenhouse gases are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it sets recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are available to anyone,
but it helps you go from having to
[SPEAKER_00]: retrofit your entire house and being
overwhelmed by it to honing in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest priorities or the easiest things
to do first or most cost-effective things
[SPEAKER_00]: to do first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have it for all different kinds
of building types, not just New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: building types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other point I want to stress here
is that New York City, their emissions are
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is also, Rob, we're not going
to talk about it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge objective in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that each time you do something,
you can see how you're moving towards your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal of energy reduction and greenhouse
gas mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make this all real, we have
coordinated an energy expo for you all
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, open on the Ag Quad from 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, no rain is scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in the Mann Library foyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the foyer is mostly incentives and job
opportunities and some business displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside, it's all equipment to
electrify your lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how to make maple sugaring
more efficient, how to build affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: storm windows, understanding window
science, explore electric tractors,
[SPEAKER_00]: skid steers, and sawmills, learn about
precision ag drone features, find
[SPEAKER_00]: incentives to weatherize your home,
explore electric landscaping equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand the next generation of
greenhouse light efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point is that it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our land is 61% forested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to bring us into our space.
[SPEAKER_00]: 61% forested, 20% agriculture,
13% idle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to think about how to
activate those idle lands, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As extension, we work with homeowners or
we work with farmers or foresters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times do we work with an idle or
former ag landowner?
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to activate those in order to
think about the big picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal here is the highest and best
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would argue we should activate those
idle lands for solar so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue growing high quality products on
our ag land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fundamentally, everything we do to
conserve energy conserves both our climate
[SPEAKER_00]: and our land area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are launching into today's
panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're first going to hear from Gabriel
Gurley from CCE Tompkins about farm energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to hear from Ken about
electrifying landscaping equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll hear from Josh about
weatherizing homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle will then present on some
efficiency pilots that she's been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully it's all going to work
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at 345, Maureen Letty from New York
State Department of Environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservation will come in and talk about
the New York State CAP and INVEST or NICI
[SPEAKER_00]: program that is coming forward as a way to
fund these kinds of projects and more as
[SPEAKER_00]: we move this process along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so which piece of this pie are you
going to eat up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is tasty work we have in front
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabriel, come on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
