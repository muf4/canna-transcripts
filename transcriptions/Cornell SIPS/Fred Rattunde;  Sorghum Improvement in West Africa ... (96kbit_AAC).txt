[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge pleasure and honor for me to
welcome Fred Rotundi as our second speaker
[SPEAKER_00]: of the series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was going to be Eva and Fred,
per the title slide that's on our screens
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Eva's sick in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Fred, illustrating one of the many
positive features of a teamwork approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to science, Fred is here and going to give
the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fred, a huge thanks for being with us
and best wishes to Eva for feeling much
[SPEAKER_00]: better soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me introduce the two of them,
starting with our speaker, Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say at the outset here
that back in 2015, the pair of them
[SPEAKER_00]: received a tremendous honor of the Justus
von Liebig Award for World Nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a huge honor from the German
government and, or maybe I'm wrong that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a government, but a huge,
huge honor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizing lifetime achievement for this
very distinguished pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd also received the King Bowdoin
Award for pearl millet breeding in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extremely accomplished pair of breeders
for dryland cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with Fred, Fred is from
Wisconsin and the two of them are still
[SPEAKER_00]: associate or now have been since 2016
associate with the University of Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_00]: where Fred's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of their daughters is currently
there in Wisconsin and the others there
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred and Eva are currently in Germany
where Eva is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fred got his master's and PhD from Iowa
State back in the 80s and then got a,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd gotten his bachelor's at University
of Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he did a dairy internship,
Peace Corps in Ecuador, worked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Iowa in the 80s,
early 80s, and oat breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the mid 80s, started working on
pearl millet breeding with ICRASAD in
[SPEAKER_00]: India, the International Center for
Research in the Semi-Airdropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then did a postdoc back in Hohenheim
in Germany, working on rye breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since the early 90s have been
back with the International Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Research in the
Semi-Airdropics, ICRASAD first for some
[SPEAKER_00]: years in India, working in Rajasthan,
and then for almost 20 years working as
[SPEAKER_00]: principal scientists on sorghum breeding
and genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eva sort of, they both been Wisconsin,
Germany, India, West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Eva got her start in Hohenheim
with her degrees, but she actually did her
[SPEAKER_00]: high school years in Beirut, Lebanon,
which I had not been aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and she also had a stint with the
Technical University of Munich in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was in collaboration with ICARDA,
one of the other area international
[SPEAKER_00]: centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eva also played key roles in the Drylands
Collaborative Research Program of the CG
[SPEAKER_00]: of recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both bring, I think for this
summit, I'm really pleased that it's two
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects that I hope will interest
everybody a lot, which is, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for the dryland cereals and with
climate issues, and stresses ramping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are insights on breeding for
difficult and heterogeneous environments
[SPEAKER_00]: will be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the idea of participatory
research, engaging farmers themselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the research process, sometimes at
impressive scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thirdly, but I'm sure not lastly,
the idea of how to work with farmers on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed systems, getting the products of the
breeding process into the hands of more
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in a way that is fully respects
their roles as decision makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actors in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think these are some of these things
are areas where we, we as a department,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry, now a section, don't have as
much formal training for our students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just really appreciate,
I really appreciate Fred, your sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: your insights and experience with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of demand around
agricultural thinking and breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just from the students, also from the
whole whole faculty as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this participatory and stress related
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over to you, Fred, with tremendous
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And best wishes to Eva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just start right in with our
talk, which really was representing,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to distill our experiences and
contributions from so many partners
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the years, regarding sorghum
improvement in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first, just a few pictures,
just to get an impression of sorghum here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Mali in the field, harvesting the
braided bundles of panicles of selected
[SPEAKER_01]: panicles that farmers are going to be
keeping for using as seed and where
[SPEAKER_01]: sorghum is grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across West and Central Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across a wide band, as you can see,
stretching from Senegal and the far West,
[SPEAKER_01]: across to Sudan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And conforming to the rainfall iso-heights
that are actually very narrow bands
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching east to west.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sorghum being a staple crop,
in a very broad area involving many,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, different agri-ecosystems,
ranging from about 100 days of growing
[SPEAKER_01]: period to 200 days of growing period,
based on the lengths of rainfall in the
[SPEAKER_01]: single rainy season per year, unimodal
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect of importance for sorghum
production in West Africa is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: soils are very old, highly weathered,
and plant-available phosphorus is very
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see here, where the level for
sufficiency threshold is about 10 parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how much of West Africa is
colored yellow, which is five or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that translates here into experiences
for many people, individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have a sample of 90 farmers fields
who were participating in sorghum variety
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men and women, equal numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the majority of both are
below that sufficiency threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But particularly women, which actually
would be expected when their system of
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation is understood and that typically
women are assigned the fields for their
[SPEAKER_01]: use when the fertility has dropped so low
that the men who are responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: producing the staple cereals like sorghum,
bromelette, corn, it's no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the women who very often are growing
peanuts for the sauce, men are having the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest fertility available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this short background for sorghum
production in West Africa, we in the big
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, both even myself as breeders with
ECRSAT in an international egg research
[SPEAKER_01]: center, as well as the national program
breeders are faced with several dilemmas
[SPEAKER_01]: for improving sorghum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is what germplasm base to use
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how to design an effective
selection strategy that meets the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, complexity of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to get seed of those new varieties to
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does it mean to breed for
achieving development goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: These dilemmas will provide the structure
for what I will share and hopefully we can
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the germplasm base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorghum can be classified into five major
races based on the grain shape and the
[SPEAKER_01]: gloom shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morphological characteristics,
which interestingly enough, match very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely with what is found when doing
molecular marker diversity studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very beautiful study,
which Cornell has been a big part of for
[SPEAKER_01]: sorghum with analysis using GWAS of nearly
a thousand sorghum accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are germplasm gene bank accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this, we can see how those major
races really divide up from the map of
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa and the distribution of those
races.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that the quadatum race in blue
is really important in Eastern and
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the race that has been used
most widely in international breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide from India to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Guinea race, the tan color is actually
distributed worldwide and is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most, it is actually based on molecular
studies, the most diverse of the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: West Africa has predominantly and almost
only the Guinea race with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: Dura actually in the drier Sahel region.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also interesting while we're on this,
just to note how for the sorghums in far
[SPEAKER_01]: West Africa, that would be from Senegal
through Mali to Burkina Faso, separate
[SPEAKER_01]: from those, I'm sorry, I did, it's
actually would be far West would be those
[SPEAKER_01]: and separate from those of the more humid
areas, Nigeria, Siberia and Cameroon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually has, we think,
gives some useful insights for hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, but we can maybe touch on that
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the germplasm options for breeding
sorghum basically are two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to use a land-raised germplasm,
which is widely grown by farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: is considered to be rustic, meaning low
yield, grain yield, but very resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tall, average three meters,
four meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had trials, even five meter height
average.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photo period sensitive, but there's been
very little formal breeding done in this
[SPEAKER_01]: race and thus no materials are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second option would be to use the
improved germplasm developed through
[SPEAKER_01]: international breeding efforts,
which is short height and almost entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: insensitive to photo period and is
predominantly caudate and based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the photos, the upper two are of
Guinea panicles, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_01]: very different from here, from Mali
caudate material, more compact panicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see with a sufficient
resolution of the photos here,
[SPEAKER_01]: considerable grain mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also because of the compact
panicles, feeding of head bugs with nice
[SPEAKER_01]: protection in those compact panicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many traits that need to be
considered for sorghum breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, if you will, most of them
only need to meet a certain threshold for
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptability.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to improve all of them,
but they have to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But grain yield really is imperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one that needs improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's identified by farmers as being a top
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stover quality is another trait that
really represents tremendous opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: as the local land-race sorghums,
tall, extremely sturdy, woody,
[SPEAKER_01]: and non-digestible for livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with crop livestock integration,
a real opportunity for improving stover
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the two options that we have
laid out, the land-race material,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically Guinea, and the improved caudate
materials, we can see that for most of
[SPEAKER_01]: those traits required for adaptation for
quality, they are present in the land-race
[SPEAKER_01]: chermplasm, which is material that evolved
and was selected in that environment as
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the improved caudate
materials, with the exception,
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly, of, for example, stover
quality and specific resistances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in short, we, as a group, have
targeted work using the Guinea race as a
[SPEAKER_01]: chermplasm base, with its very hard grain,
which is resistant to decortication
[SPEAKER_01]: losses, which we'll come to later,
and the flax, loose panicle, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation, advantages for adaptation,
and the photoperiod sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is important for plasticity of
matching the growth duration of the sown
[SPEAKER_01]: crop to the available moisture,
and achieving basically the same flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: maturity date, irrespective of whether
it's sown in mid-June or end of July,
[SPEAKER_01]: and adaptation to various factors,
soil fertility, excess of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as insufficient water.
[SPEAKER_01]: With chermplasm of land-race and improved
land-race materials, we and predecessors
[SPEAKER_01]: have created random mating populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tall Guinea land-race from that derived a
dwarf Guinea land-race, Guinea population,
[SPEAKER_01]: also one for low adaptation, and also more
narrow-based populations with
[SPEAKER_01]: back-crossing diverse donors of different
races, including the Guinea, to a Guinea
[SPEAKER_01]: parent, and then back-crossing once to the
Guinea parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from these different populations,
we have been able to obtain useful
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, with dwarf height,
which did not exist prior in the land-race
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, combined with stover quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these populations are ideal for
sharing with others, with other breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: also with farmers, who can select
according to their priorities and
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second issue question is how to design
an effective selection strategy,
[SPEAKER_01]: with increasing grain yield being a top
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, there is, I can say at
most, a single research station per
[SPEAKER_01]: agroecological zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the on-station, experiment station
conditions are very different and poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: represented to represent the target
conditions in the farmer's fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are also very diverse, with a broad
complexity of environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we have seen, many traits of
importance for acceptance and adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difficulty for individuals to be
able to discriminate among progenies or
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for really important traits,
like yield, food yield, and for farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: for traits requiring more managed
conditions, for example, straggler
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our results from trying to address
those issues through collaboration between
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and farmers, we begin here with a
study on early generation yield
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real question, as we've just mentioned,
with on-station and on-farm conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: being so different and wanting to maximize
genetic gain for farmer conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with 150 early generation progenies
tested and selected both on-farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: with subsets of 50 progenies per farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on-station, with the whole set
together in three replicates, alpha-latus
[SPEAKER_01]: design in two fields, one with low
phosphorus, plant available phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one with high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 12 progenies selected from each,
with actually, it turns out three being in
[SPEAKER_01]: common between those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were tested over two years in
farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have the yield of those
progenies plotted against the trial means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is we have in black
the checks, land-raised varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the others are selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see some progress over the
land-raised checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The selections from on-farm and on-station
are actually overlapping, but the three
[SPEAKER_01]: that were selected from both on-farm and
on-station were very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three cheers for combining results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The involvement of the breeders with
farmers in conducting on-farm
[SPEAKER_01]: participatory variety trials for yield
became a major aspect of the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs in Mali and in the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these trials were testing 30 to 40
progenies, varieties, both on-station as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as on-farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here this table shows the results
prepared with the names of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each column is a different farmer with the
yield given in 100 kilo sacs, a unit they
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify with.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, in a local language, the mean yield
and the repeatability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And color-coded for above mean,
based on standard deviation, standard
[SPEAKER_01]: error, mean and below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers would study these and use
these as well as, of course, the breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: using this data for making decisions on
what to retain, what to focus on for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, seed production in the
following years, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, trial results from those,
yield results from those trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have blue and red, the local
variety here, blue, the local variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see here a very promising progeny
that shows superior yield across the
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity range to the local varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an open pollinated variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have two hybrids or actually
three hybrids and the local.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see here, again, with these
trials, we can really see the performance
[SPEAKER_01]: across productivity conditions,
which is a whole mix of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the open pollinated varieties,
we had managed to make 10, 15% gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the hybrids, we had 30% yield to
priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The post-harvest quality testing also
became an important part of the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: series conducted, both for
[SPEAKER_01]: taste, consistency, quality of the food
with taste testing, but also in the
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation and processing of the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the actions that, as a group we're
being taken, we're testing and selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: in the target zone, thanks to many farmers
at class for their cooperation,
[SPEAKER_01]: testing in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under a range of conditions,
both fertility and unstation was managed,
[SPEAKER_01]: though phosphorus, as well as the routine
recommended, if you will, fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And linking breeding and crop management
and food preparation in the mix of the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding decision-making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers were involved, integrated into
the different stages of the breeding cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: through these trials, through discussions
during the trials, in the annual feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings and planning meetings,
et cetera, for setting priorities for
[SPEAKER_01]: generating diversity, particularly the
random mating populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In selections, farmers and breeders love
to select, but especially farmers love to
[SPEAKER_01]: select individual plants, spanicles,
to the evaluation and to bridal release
[SPEAKER_01]: and dissemination, which we'll be talking
about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were really, a network of farmers
and breeders established for variety
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and selection, which is presented
here in this map, here with the experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: stations of ECRSAT and two of the national
program, Sargon Breeding Program,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the farmer cooperatives or unions of
cooperatives that were collaborating with
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across Southern Valley with a backdrop of
the rainfall iso-height.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third question, how to get seed of
these new varieties that are being bred to
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take an overview, a snapshot from
the year 2000, where the National Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Service was largely dysfunctional.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the structural adjustments being in
full swing and the extension services
[SPEAKER_01]: shrinking or disappearing completely,
there were no private sector seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies present and farmers did not
purchase seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically an unknown behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, at that time, variety
registration, in the national variety
[SPEAKER_01]: catalog was very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeders could just develop a
description, fish technique, and send it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the responsible person for inclusion as
the breeder was responsible for choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: and maintaining the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seed certification was possible,
but expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steps that were taken in this background
for getting seed to farmers of these new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were detailed studies of the
farmer's seed management system conducted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer organizations, farmer clops that
were involved or interested in grain
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing were identified as likely having
interest and demand for new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And collaborating farmers in the variety
testing activities on their own decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: initiate large scale seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through these various activities,
there was joint learning by the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations and the various partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including NGOs, radio, breeders,
and disseminating seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with some results here from a
study of the farmer seed system in one
[SPEAKER_01]: village in Mali, in which it was found
that there were 12 varieties being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in that village with one to five varieties
being grown by each of the large extended
[SPEAKER_01]: families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corresponding to the different uses and
adaptations, specificities of those
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and the conditions available to
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The source of those varieties were
basically from the village or from the
[SPEAKER_01]: family and from the farmer's own
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had several surprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was that although there are many
varieties being grown, there are only one
[SPEAKER_01]: or two varieties that were really
predominant that were covering about 80%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that those varieties were changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that were currently predominant
were very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were less than 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these new varieties actually rarely
came from formal sources from breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there was learning of the social
expectations and thinking about seed and
[SPEAKER_01]: obtaining seed in acceptable ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, that a good farmer produces
his or her own seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That taking seed from outside at the time
of sowing is not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it really is a prestige to be asked
by someone to give them seed, but taking
[SPEAKER_01]: money for that seed is not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the farmers almost universally
welcomed testing and move right in the
right direction.
And so that was a big surprise for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very excited about the new
varieties.
We were excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I asked, would you like small
trials looking at three to five varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: or big trials?
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, people always wanted the more
we can see the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through many years of learning by doing
basically and discussing, we learned
[SPEAKER_01]: several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that the on-farm variety trials
actually didn't assure large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness or dissemination of new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we were thinking might be
piggybacked on the testing program.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the farmer's interest and demand
for receiving trial sets, especially of
[SPEAKER_01]: the not the first stage testing,
but the second stage entirely farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: managed only three to five varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Far outstripped the breeder's capacity to
provide with requests going up to 200,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300, 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the collaborating farmers,
as I mentioned, the farmers who were
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the variety testing and their
own decided to start producing seed of
[SPEAKER_01]: those varieties as a really conscious
decision to address the issue of
[SPEAKER_01]: disseminating seed of the newly developed
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seed, certified seed that they
were producing was increasing yearly,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doubling from year to year with
the farmer seed cooperative selling to
[SPEAKER_01]: emerging seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, after many years of this growth
in seed production, there still is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically no noticeable seed being grown
coming seed through that pathway by the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors of those farmer seed
cooperatives in the areas where those
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer seed cooperatives were located,
which led to discussions among the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: and with the breeders, which led to
exploring different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, that of selling mini packs,
test packets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here just to give a, a picture of the
number of certain varieties that these
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer seed cooperatives produced during a
four year period with, I would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight, it was the farmers themselves
and their organizations who decided which
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties to produce on their own risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no contracting or the breeders
were only there supporting with provision
[SPEAKER_01]: of the foundation seed, as well as
accompanying with various activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So across three different areas,
a large number of varieties being produced
[SPEAKER_01]: and the majority were the new varieties of
the open pollinated traditional type
[SPEAKER_01]: three, four meter height.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few land races that were
continually produced, but the quantity was
[SPEAKER_01]: not increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a few bred of this
traditional type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of varieties that they were
producing were of new types of short and
[SPEAKER_01]: dual grain plus stover types and of
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened, the outcomes from the mini
packs, those hundred gram seed packets
[SPEAKER_01]: that were farmers seed coops were selling
for very little money, but offering
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers a chance to look at new varieties,
as well as the first chance to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: buy, to pay money to receive seed for
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was successful in terms of farmers
saving seed and even a significant,
[SPEAKER_01]: considerable number sharing seed with
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is both for sorghum and millet,
Mali and Burkina Faso and Niger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can come back to the question,
can sorghum seed be sold to farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And seed can be sold if it's for testing
in the local culture and if it benefits a
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So individuals, no, no goal, but for a
farmer cooperative, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mini packs were great for marketing,
but did not generate income sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the years, the demand for larger
seed packages increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed coops currently are still selling
mostly to bulk buyers, but the market is
[SPEAKER_01]: unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the whim of NGOs government programs on
very short notice, but the farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seed directly to, the seed coops
are selling directly to farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they realize is a more sustainable
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many option, many advantages of farmers as
managers of seed businesses, the trust and
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability and the quality and
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building on farmers expertise and
capacities, it's generating income where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's needed in the rural areas and the
farmers seed coops can partner with
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders for continuing to develop new
varieties, feeding the pipeline and making
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed system sustainable and with other
value chain actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last point is breeding for
sustainable development goals with the
[SPEAKER_01]: example of sorghum improvement for
micronutrient nutrition in Mali.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first step is to understand the
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, very briefly, the consumption
study would show that all types of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition aspects are deficient,
but iron across the board total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at feasibility for improving
nutritional status via bio-fertification
[SPEAKER_01]: in brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorghum is important, especially so
children's diets are so limited,
[SPEAKER_01]: so based on staple cereal sorghum millet
maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to increase the iron content in the
flour to make a meaningful difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition requires a dramatic increase in
the concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good news, there is a genetic variability
of relatively low genotype by phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: or environment interactions, high
heritability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breeding can contribute, but only as
one component.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not enough alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the use of sorghum by women,
grown by women, what's interesting to find
[SPEAKER_01]: that thanks to a social science student,
Eva van den Broek, that the sorghum that
[SPEAKER_01]: women grew was frequently used to prepare
a special meal for the children when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were hungry, when there was no leftovers
available, which would never come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: men's granary because that food is for the
family for the main meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pathway for child nutrition and
bio-fertification through women and
[SPEAKER_01]: women's sorghum cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at processing and preparation of
the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have a whole grain in green and
manually decorticated the traditional way,
[SPEAKER_01]: modern pestle producing flour,
removing the seed coat to produce flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that decortication, there's the
loss of 50% of the iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the phytate as well as zinc,
the phytate content is reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: proportionally, meaning there's no
improvement or no change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability of the iron or zinc is
simply reduced through decortication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the breeder has been incorporated more
systematically and actually giving more
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to that trait decortication
rate, decortication losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here from the farmer on farm participatory
variety trials, different varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: the percent of grain lost during
decortication of the different varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: range from 10% to 30% L marks land race
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that we have mix of improved
and land race varieties and that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: big difference, much more difference than
the content of iron and zinc per se in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here from on farm trials with too high
hybrids fata and, sorry, one hybrid fata,
[SPEAKER_01]: an OPV lata and to look at variety table,
very similar iron concentrations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grain across environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one hybrid that was very poor sewa
with very low decortication yield and low
[SPEAKER_01]: iron content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the changes made in the breeding
program were to observe the grain quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring iron and zinc concentrations
and really critically making sure that new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties show advantages when grown in
women's fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means under low phosphorus
conditions, also typically in
[SPEAKER_01]: intercropping conditions, for example,
with ground nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The collaboration with the breeder with
food technologists, nutritionists identify
[SPEAKER_01]: options for improving nutrition,
including and beyond simply genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: biofortification and developing
collaboration also for education.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply in the trials talking about
nutrition about micronutrients was a new
[SPEAKER_01]: concept led to changes and differences in
behavior on the part of farmers as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, the fact of breeding in
the center of sorghum domestication,
[SPEAKER_01]: setting priorities and building clarity of
what is targeted, the product profiles if
[SPEAKER_01]: you will, the selection strategies
required farmers participation with
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and interdisciplinary
collaboration with social scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: gender specialists, nutritionists,
physiologists contributed and agronomists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that large yield improvements are
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% gains with the complexity of
environments and factors cannot be noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: by farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot generate any momentum,
if you will, but 20%, 30% is needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: really make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those yield improvements must be made
with the appropriate array of adaptation
[SPEAKER_01]: and quality characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that farmer breeder collaborative
networks really have so much to offer in
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting bridal diversity, ensuring
experiences and resources that the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: and breeders bringing together can create
synergies of the information flow and
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also gender considerations and gender
inclusion is essential for achieving
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits for the whole family and
community, even though this is a crop that
[SPEAKER_01]: is considered to be a men's crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the importance to be aware
and considerate to do no harm,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be attended to through inclusion
of all different people and learning
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to thank you and thank
the contributions of so many, many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just to mention that there is the
references in full at the end for anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who is interested to look further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much, Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say we don't have a ton of time
left, but may I ask if anyone would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring up any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually easily see the hands
raised feature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody wants to just go ahead,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing no open mics, let me make one
comment and one question, Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the honor about a year ago of
visiting Mali and seeing one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: participatory sorghum trials play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful piece of performance
art or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hybrid that farmers were testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was maybe their 100th event,
I was told, where you had ICROSAT and NGO
[SPEAKER_00]: people and people from the community
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just very, very impressive how
people were able to follow a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol, even using digital technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And women were able to represent
themselves very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decisions were made both on the
agronomy over the season that farmers had
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded the data and also on the culinary
test that was done on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a testimonial that was
really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was wondering if you could
comment on the issue of G by E of any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three best varieties you mentioned
came out both on farm and on station,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in a way isn't that consistent with
me with the imperative of going on farm to
[SPEAKER_00]: see different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, did you see what you would
consider meaningful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some of those lines crossing here
and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there anything that you would
consider meaningful G by E that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves note?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your testimonials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testimonials are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: G by E, it was interesting with analysis
of the on farm trial data, trying to tease
[SPEAKER_01]: out major factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different factors and
they're really interwoven.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the conclusion is, is that you really
need to test across a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainfall alone, onset or ending and strike
of presence or weeding, totally weed
[SPEAKER_01]: infested or not, soil fertility,
all of them play a part, but we couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: pull anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding on farm, combining on farm and
on station tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, it's a small sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put the results in perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the on station test was both with
regular favorable conditions as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: under managed low phosphorus conditions,
which are approaching farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: field conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The productivity is 50% out of under the
normal, if you will, conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had higher correlation with on farm
trial results, higher genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: correlations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heritability was not much worse and was a
really variable contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say test on low P fields alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also is risking failures, which we do
to the low fertility, susceptibility to,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, late infestation with sort of
midge, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really combining results from many
different environments and collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: among breeders, among farmers is the way
to deal with G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a couple of comments in the
chat and then I would, unless anybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: a point to make, we can turn Fred over to
the graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kathleen Hefferon has said,
how can the idea of gender differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and farming be transmitted to
Westerners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ruby followed on with a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I second interest in that concept as new
to me personally, but also as a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: illustration of gender differences that
can contribute to better breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: women's fields is very interesting to me
and a concept I'd like to explore further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of people with clear interest
in the gender issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to say on that topic,
Fred?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm the wrong person about
transmitting gender issues to Westerners
[SPEAKER_01]: being that we spend most of our time in
West Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's from that perspective that
we're seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have much experience trying
to talk to Westerners, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're better at West Africans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ava has been doing, and not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing my ignorance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ava has been doing training programs,
but that's not for Westerners.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was thinking is, it's talking,
talking, talking, and learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it was, we were not from the
beginning engaged in any explicit gender
[SPEAKER_01]: activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were interested, but we were doing what
we thought was most appropriate with the
[SPEAKER_01]: resources we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with learning, for example,
that social science student insisted she
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to study women and women's organ
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ava said, OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, we learned, wow,
there really is a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do need to take this into
consideration in our breeding program if
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to consider the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same way for nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot deal with nutrition if we don't
include women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was such a big learning for
us, is by involving women, be it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: culinary testing, be it in the farmer
participatory trials specifically designed
[SPEAKER_01]: for women, seed production, including
women in the discussions, it changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion and brought progress that would
have been missed otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now 1.35, so we've gone a bit
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Ellie has reminded me that
the graduate student meeting with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred, starts at what is for us 1.50,
so 15 minutes from now, which is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: later and later for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's meant to afford you, I think,
a chance to take a breather between duties
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I should thank you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to weigh in, please type
into the chat, and we'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: entertain your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, Fred, I really want to
thank you for a beautiful seminar and for
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing all of that experience over that
career in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot to value there, and I really
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would be ready to maybe come
back to this room in 15 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalina, are you going to hold the room,
or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually a link to click on for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Ellie's like panicking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebecca doesn't know what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As usual, OK, so thank you so much again,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Fred, and best wishes for
Eva's feeling better very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
