[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Bill said, we do have a long-standing
trials program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State got in a flower trial in 1933.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm privileged to step in behind Al
and Michael and carry this program
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things we did was to add
in-ground perennial trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the annual trials,
all our annuals are grown in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't tell people what they need to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send them an application form,
and they choose what they want us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very well-oriented program from
the supplier company point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like if you haven't
been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Debbie, you can close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is Petunia Alley, and this
picture's actually from 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And numbers of entries fluctuate in our
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our peak was about 2011,
when we had 1,300 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this area has the capacity to do 1,600
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always looking for more companies
to come in and more submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't get to control that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can whine and bleed a cast in my glass
of Californian Sanctum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most cases, the roster is
predetermined prior to our arrival at that
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an aerial shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize for the color quality on
this, because it was taken by a drone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, Penn State's drone fleet was
rammed by the FAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're back in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we need upgrade on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photographic quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also run satellite sites,
or I should say collaborative sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hershey Gardens is the oldest of our
collaborative sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do traveling in-ground there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hershey Gardens staff and the Master
Gardeners of Gotham County, where Hershey
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens is in place, are instrumental in
carrying the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're usually running about 70,000 to
90 varieties, a subset of our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we have about 950 varieties in
the game this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will get a single rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll give them all funds,
because the plant died over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fluctuating winter temperatures,
and quite a whole bunch of Dianthus one
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Jeroen from Hilbert,
Detroit, and he said, God, my plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy in Siberia, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Russians are not hardy in Siberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go there, they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my Dianthus did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, look at the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do a subset at the Ag Farmer's
Days event, which is a three-day event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's held up at State College,
and that's hosted at the Larson Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over 2,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during those three days, we garner
typically 22,000 visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this we added last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was delighted when the Master Gardeners
of Allegheny County agreed to play in on
[SPEAKER_00]: our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have, this is a 3,000 acre park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the park, and where the red circle
is in the center there, you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: area where these trials are conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're doing in-ground testing at
all three of those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice comparison to the largely
container-produced plants at CRED,
[SPEAKER_00]: which stands for the South East
Agricultural Research Extension Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought it was a nautical accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't print any paper copies,
but if you visit our web page,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this data is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is click on the trial
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were looking at San Antonio,
all the cultivars that were in the program
[SPEAKER_00]: would come up, the number of how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually click this rating
button at the more end on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives the viewer information that is
a little more comprehensive than the
[SPEAKER_00]: national trials data, which we also feed
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that picture, then you can
see the actual scores and comments that
[SPEAKER_00]: were rendered during that trials period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of greenhouse operators
really are taking advantage of this if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some of the plain-sect folks,
the Amish and Mennonite natives,
[SPEAKER_00]: and friends who come out, and they'll take
a bullet, go through the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and spend several hours in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have broker-salesmen who show up
and bring three or four clients and their
[SPEAKER_00]: writing orders right during the trials,
which I think is really great for
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and more delightful for the
healthful team industry, in that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I told you I'd talk about some top
ratings, so let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have over 63 caliber COAs in the
program this year, and these are some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that are best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these top scores are based on the
first rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, we can change this as we go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have scores that can diminish the
standing of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the first rating which was
conducted between July 2 and July 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does take me about two weeks to do
a rating because it's a 33-hour trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kabloo, many of you probably are
acquainted with this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really exciting to see a caliber
COA variety come out on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's been passed
through as a cost savings to consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps at some operations and not at
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a number of these kabloos did very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only showing you plants that
receive a 488 to 5.0 score here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the top of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from one, which means mostly dead,
all the way up to a five, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect score, a really good performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Super Bells for Alina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the Super Bells are proven
winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introductions, and they are quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a wonderful line of petunias as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to that shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I posted this lemon slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Oralina did exceptionally well on
the first rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they had a nice tight cap and
a lot of bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foliar quality was top drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall growth was as expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, that received five.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a funny little thing that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Bill and Neil know immediately what
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a lot of sports in horticulture
back in the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a number of chrysanthemums varieties
were brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were actually sports of another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a yellow one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, a white branch comes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they cut that off and propagated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called proven winners about this and
said, hey, would you like us to propagate
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can serve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've turned it to you because this
is intellectual property that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: belongs to the submitting company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a contract with the
submitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it states that directly in the
contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we're trying to clean it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess they didn't want the score.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an interesting variegated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know about Dan Himes, you know more
variegated plants come out from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a keen fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this actually is kind of attractive
with the white flower and the white
[SPEAKER_00]: margins of the leaf in these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little yellow lines running through
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ones, these are both
proven winners plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pomegranate punch and superbells yellow
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very, very good performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had some of these in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pomegranate punch won last year as a
top 10% plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it will be good for us again
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacholus love these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is we continually
have a battle with alternate area fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: in the patinius and caliber coas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fungus that is omnivorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attacks a large number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't actually eradicate it from the
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, you know your disease
triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can break one of those legs,
you can check the disease problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't eliminate the alternate area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the infectious material is always
present at the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get to that period,
which is right about now, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patinius try to drop a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spray a lot of fungicide to
keep ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pacholus have no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to skate right through that with
that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pacholus is actually a hybrid between
caliber coa and patinius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're particularly strong blueish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hat is off to Cicada Steve for
developing these wonderful, wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other patinius varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, pacholus is actually the
cheaper patinius market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while they're maybe something
different, they're really sold under the
[SPEAKER_00]: same auspices as we would have with
patinius.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are some of the top four
patinius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have over 100 cultivars in the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers will come in and say,
I need 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show me 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you come back and repeat your
visits to the site, then you can attain
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic data that you really need for
selection and development your next year's
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Easy Wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from Pan Am Sea, as stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're extremely nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a good bloom quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have an intriguing color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Singer is one of our long-term
participants in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very, very pleased with what they
bring to the prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's very nice material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tepella, at least, is a striking variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that because of that little
gold sticker on the tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes the company will say it's
new to us, but they had sent it to us the
[SPEAKER_00]: year before under a number or something to
try it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it actually shows up as a new
plant, it then states it affixed that
[SPEAKER_00]: little gold seal to the tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell visitors, if you get lost in the
gardens, just look at the tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell exactly where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says bed A, clock number 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tongue cheek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tepella White, also from Dan Singer,
was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this beautiful Cascades Purple
Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly performed very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still looking good today,
three weeks after the first rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a stellar job by Dan Singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked back in our records at Penn State
and discovered that we had over 180
[SPEAKER_00]: entries for Dan Singer in 2010,
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the man who had been working with
us, Reese Flick, had passed away suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big loss in horticulture and one
of our friends at the trial garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sad about Reese.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put out a bid and put all the Dan
Singer material in there as a memorial to
[SPEAKER_00]: him for that season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, now Dan Singer's on a
different tack and they're going in and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing about 20 to 30 varieties for test
site cutting that way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of their material is pretty
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we have participation from
Dume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dume is our second biggest plant submitter
to the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a Sun Tunia Neon Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the surprise blue sky, both very good
plants, long blooming, lots of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sun Tunia's a little bit more
trailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surprise blue sky's a little more in
the upper right columnar, as we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both are excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good colors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have other contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running over 36 firms that enter in
the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some enter one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others enter quite close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ball is our biggest contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 230 entries from Ball in all
their subdivisions and permutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ernst & Arie is a real good company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the values from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of things from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this success rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if you're publishing this,
you need the exclamation point in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their doing, not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this was a strong performer
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks really good today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The success yellow has a little higher
flower density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more compact, but it fits
into the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you see lines where they
bring out a series, and you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is this in the series?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look at all like these other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Julia Child used to say, well,
it's just my thought line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indeed, this is a good line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're going to perform
beautifully throughout the season as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants that are really,
really strong.
We've had a number of these blankets in
the past.
Blanket rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blanket violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I discovered about those
right away is they seem to also,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Pachos, have a strong resistance
to our major difficulty with the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternating light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a new one to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blanket blue star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very strong performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevation white from Keensler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Keensler has it at fingers in a number
of highs, including the botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from this picture,
this is a very, very strong bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, proven winners,
Super Toonie line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breeders and salespeople from some
of the other firms come in and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so hard to beat those Super Toonies,
especially in the heat and humidity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: made experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you guys up here are enjoying about a
6 to 8 degree advantage over us down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land is still very humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every morning we wake up, it's about 100%
humidity, maybe 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you get to noon or 2 o
'clock, it's dropped down to about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out to the west coast and you'll find
that if you get to 50% in many cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while everything looks great at
California at the cast program,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you bring it back to our conditions
here, things are a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of folks come to the
land is still area from all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have visitors from Europe, yes,
but also from about nine states
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the lion's share of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes I kind of wonder about the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, maybe they chose that
one after the two martini luncheon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any event, some of these names are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being a person with roots in
perennials, naming there is not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way because that's the tariff as it is
with the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they kind of stay ahead of the curve,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some more supertiniens and
they're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the best selling petunia in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_00]: is supertiniens to Baldwin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to drive, I drive about 15
minutes from home to work to this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment station and I go along this
small highway, Pins highway or Route 340.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could count the number of lists of
bubblegums you would see on the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have to say the market share is
really a little bit on that plan because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other things like frankincenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know about the frankincenies,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a list come out this year and it
stemmed from originally African Sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had it in our trials program
several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was out at American Talkie and
that's their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had another really nice one,
Trilogy Red out there, which we were so
[SPEAKER_00]: keen to get in our program and we had to
throw it out because any GMO plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States that's marketed or
distributed needs to have a registration
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate with the USDA and it did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a guy in Finland who's a very capable
botanist saw this at a train station,
[SPEAKER_00]: took a piece back to the lab and
discovered that, oh wow, there's a corn
[SPEAKER_00]: gene in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, none of us believe that this is
going to be an ecological problem or
[SPEAKER_00]: create issues in terms of our plant
development here in the United States or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since it was a legal matter,
there's no arguing with that as you all
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, after all, a litigious society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discarded about four varieties,
but I felt myself lucky because the list
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out was finally published on
June 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over 60 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt sorry for the big producers who
had to throw away all kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope they did not have too serious
an impact from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group that's been showing some
real promise besides the Super 2 is this
[SPEAKER_00]: Deco series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have about five or six of those
from Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like Syngenta's products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are pretty strong,
but these Deco's are looking very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing considerably and looking
like very little fun little difficulties
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the near foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would give those a second thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower size is a little smaller than
some of the larger petunias, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: good cultivars, nevertheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Deco White.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just loaded with blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, is new to the program as
indicated by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little star up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the hippomias where sweet potato
vines can be very well forced,
[SPEAKER_00]: except in one respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have miles of turf at CREC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that the beetles,
the Japanese beetles, the babies plant
[SPEAKER_00]: routinely about the last week to the first
week of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a distinct preference for
the black ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're selling black petunias,
they're developing those for urban
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're going to go in areas where
turf is present or prevalent, you'll wind
[SPEAKER_00]: up with some beetle damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I regrettably had to bring out some
heavy artillery and chemical department to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on top of that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I absolutely refuse to have our sweet
potatoes looking like Swiss cheese or
[SPEAKER_00]: field day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, having said that background
information, these two came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: solar tower black and solar tower red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually climbing varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have them here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, a whole new market share for
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made some beautiful mixed
containers with these spare parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating other annual and perennial
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about this tall right now on these
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get back and take a picture,
they're probably completely buried in
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a supporting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these varieties do very well for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare for one to wind up with a lower
score than 4.6, 4.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm keeping my eye keenly on these
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something very,
very intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that, this is one that
actually purloined in California this
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was visiting Cicada, which we do a fair
bit of business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran across this little birdie series
of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are designed for containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the full height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, these plants are so loaded
with fruit, I can't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably get at least two quarts
off of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should state that when we pot up out
here, we take all our clubs that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: February through April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we even earn this advantage as
to having entries show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all go into four and a half inch
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we place three four and a half
inch pots into this five gallon container
[SPEAKER_00]: that sits on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps us standardize things going
into the prousal evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the little birdies are named for
birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's penaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's red robin and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a container that's on a deck or
patio or balcony, a wonderful thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to have to worry about
wind damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: From these plants blowing over as to do
with some of the taller varieties that are
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen for containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty tickled about that series.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some of these sun birdies from
Proven Winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw one at Cullen out in California
that's actually a beautiful clear rich
[SPEAKER_00]: paint, which I've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love this appeal lemon, which is a
strong grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a nice color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture is a little overexposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have shot it on a cloudier day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has been with us for a number
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year it gets a very high score,
always winding up in the 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lovely color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to think about horticultural
cultivars that are really blue and there
aren't that many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, here's a nice white color blue,
a very strong bloomer for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get into August mid to
late, this thing will be so covered with
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers you won't be able to see the
foliage too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does need some fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen places where it's grown and
not fed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bloom, of course, is compromised
in this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite American octi entries
is this melancholy impact pot gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing has a perfect pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maintains that really well throughout
the season and also has this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: gold color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very flowery of course, very uniform,
and a strong performer at night is a good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get some marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to see marigolds,
you really should go to the balance art
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have over a hundred
different color bars in their crop
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get two, three, four, depending on the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's from K&C, the division of fall,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it had a very strong bloom,
nice color, really calls to you across the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, but nice habits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend this pilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get a lot of combinations and albeit
we have less this year than we had in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those don't do so well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wind up with plants that are three
of the same species playing nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have three different
species, sometimes one plant will heat up
[SPEAKER_00]: the other two before we get to September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are interesting combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have probably 28, I think this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we had a few more, about 35 or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one that is not really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this before, I think it was in
the program last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got a good performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually for us, usually we kill most
of our lobelia to eat, but in these
[SPEAKER_00]: combos, they seem to do nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're experimenting with why that
happens and what we can do to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: lobelia to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get up to 143 temperatures in those
containers in a hot summer day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are black plastic and black pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried growing lobelias in white pots
one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to put in thermocouples and
measured the temperature right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: container at crown height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wound up with savings of three
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this night Pompeii is a lovely
color combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: All components are playing fairly,
so we gave it a good score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one that looks sort of like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one of these after the two
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's lunch made choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mom's chosen one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, maybe that's because my older
brother had a little preference for mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, a strong performer and a good
award winner in two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our combos, we'll do two standing pots
and a hanging basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always intrigues me to see how much
difference there is between the standing
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and the hanging basket at the same
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the hanging baskets do better but
why?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sitting on dark stones
absorbing all that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting air circulation as the
temperature drops after the sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that help us with
combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are two things that are proven
winners of introductions and they're great
[SPEAKER_00]: in fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fires have been around a long time and
it's nice and happy to see all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens for us is it's a very windy
site and so a tiny tug often blows over
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's pretty sun won't stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My preference personally, is four friends
of us doing something where you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we just have to operate the pod
after the wind does by both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think the print stuff has a
remarkable density to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually grow these in all of
standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some of the university of Vermont
right at the pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse or neighborhood wasn't
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you see two plants and you're out
there standing next to them and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going, hmm, don't these look alike?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened a couple years ago when
we had Supertinian honey from Proven
[SPEAKER_00]: Winners as a continuum in the summer for
dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're standing there and I have a
couple of board members and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my vice chair of the board of
champions said, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often the company will license
something to prove to the winners,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them the opportunity to change the
name and wind up with the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked to both burns about it,
but from a visual perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are bloody identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of gerbers over the
years, but Flores Holland is a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: job with gerbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have potted varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have cut flower varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have garden varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should have seen the display out
at the California Spray Drops in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one was in with us last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing great again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good bit of bloom for gerberas in our zone
in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scent is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gerbera Sweet Blow from Flores Holland
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a strong orange color and a good
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really nice performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verbena, we have about 40 Verbena
cultivars in our program this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warren Gall is on my advisory board seated
in the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retired from Penn State Extension,
but he's not retired today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he was remarking to me yesterday
that Verbena is the exception we did this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, and I can only agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Seleka, and it's a very
strong color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls to you across the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a good bit of bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often Verbenas will cycle bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very strong period of
production of flowers and then a reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: period subsequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Enduriscapes from Ball are
always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Enduriscape Red is probably the
best of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we were in a period of about 70
degrees to over 95 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shut down a lot of Verbenas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent my interns out to the garden
and I said, I want you to cut back one pot
[SPEAKER_00]: of each variety and let's see if they come
back in 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't cut back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers were cutting back the Verbenas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that cleans them up and makes them
look a little tidier, which you may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing much to advance the bloom on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Empress Sun from Buven, another real
strong color, but also a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Superbina Cherry Burst from
Heath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, really nice color there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of Lantanas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do very well in the program until the
pollinator insects have their way with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wind up with a lot of seed
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two new cultivars out from
Ball that are supposedly sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of them, Lumify Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's sterile, we'll know because
Mrs. Stoltzfus or Mrs. Lack will be out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in their garden pinching all the
flowers off.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Smith and his wife have two kids,
one's in band, one's playing soccer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our program, we try not to do a
lot of molly potting or make maids of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that did very well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell by the blue flag that it
received a superior rating on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also did very well last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a compact variety, but the color is
strong and the pollinators just love these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got hundreds and hundreds of
skippers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Sulphurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Tiger Swallowtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of beneficial are out there
playing with the Lantanas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good insects support Lantanas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bidens, the Bidens this year are
really moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a very large flower cultivars
displayed in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we saw this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time I'd seen a King Bidens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so delighted when it showed up in
our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blooming very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it will be a good performer and
certainly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Fultabar also from dancing are quite
delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another form of color we haven't seen in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Bidens, which also are great
insects support plants, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful in their operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, this year, you can't have problems
with Sulphurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they send us 12, 15 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a very short suit of Bidens,
or excuse me, Sulphurs, this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a good one, twisted red,
and ball, and Janui.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very strong bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that sort of brain coral look to
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes a good cut flower in the
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a very long period of
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of Angelonias in our
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't realize that these are
plants that were developed from South
[SPEAKER_00]: America, German plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason there's such great plants
in the landscape of the Northeast is the
[SPEAKER_00]: bee that pollinates these things are not
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're maybe in South Florida,
maybe in South Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a bee that wants to get oil in
its nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Angelonias have oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the base of the nectar plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most North American species just avoid
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little issue with my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go into another series of
slides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these items you've seen before,
but I want to bring your attention to this
particular petunia.
This is a sensation, which is the first
petunia to receive an All-American
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection Award for fragrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to check fragrance,
probably ask the ladies to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have better sniffers than us guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondarily, we want to check in the
morning when the flowers are fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years after you've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I had to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran through some slides and took
these pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you can see the towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they tower above, they're compatriots
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other really nice pervenas
that we're looking at doing on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strong performers all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really wanted to get to was
the agonies and impatience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something that we saw out in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jennifer Puzi from Duke drew my
attention to it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, wow, it's a double beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing there is actually
sort of rosemary shading to the flowers as
[SPEAKER_00]: they begin to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several cultivars that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one is pretty much the strongest,
the wilder matched flush painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really strong player.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have impatience, a large component
of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many are tested in this kind of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one from Selecta that's pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, strong color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the varieties have bigger flowers,
but less of them per unit area plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have a lot of small flowers and the
plant pretty much is covered with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these agonies are megawatts,
and they're also the loppers of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: green leaf series, big red leaf series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amateurs can't really tell them apart,
but they've all been tallied as the best
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape agonies going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we were having, including the
pot they were standing on, about four,
[SPEAKER_00]: four and a half feet at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean as a whistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we really sweat at
Laney's Bill, Zancomonis pagoni problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zancomonis colorgoni is the cause of the
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the angel wings, the non-stocks,
the readers, it's a systemic problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another impatience, really good
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some of the Hilbert and
Pugonius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Viadore Amaretto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really strong color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a closeup of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course bounce, big bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are selected intros, and man,
they just flower their heads off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget when they sent us a
promotional video of about 18 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was sitting there, and you could
see a clock turning on the wall rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant starts to wilt and collapse.
Then it starts, and the audience went,
oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it starts to rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can watch the plant rehydrate and
come back to full glory within a very
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need bounce, or big bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the flower power of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also see it warrants three
years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that happens, and it's in the
top 10%, we put that little new sticker on
[SPEAKER_00]: the figure, day dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bright coral, very strong,
lovely plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keensler has these paradise varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big flower, and they're very
strong growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this one won two awards in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's light rose, again from Keensler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just look at that performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a glorious plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to complain about with
Keensler on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunari has these lovely non-stops,
and I'm delighted to say we only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar of Pugonia that has stopped in
Santa Bravo this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that strong color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Window boxes for urns or containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are a great component.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna stay rather compact,
and you can put your upright stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, or maybe a solar tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're a really strong color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They entered three white forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't rate on favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You rate on uniformity, flowering,
foliar quality, and overall growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty objective rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fairly consistent with what other
crews have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful, beautiful white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your megawatts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the sun, and both the megawatts
and the lockers are testing in sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sun, the bloom is a little more
strenghty.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the shade, the plants are a little
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on how you wanna culture
them, but they grow beautifully in all
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lockers, the megawatts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only has to prove the winners
brought out too this year as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look pretty close to the others,
but excellent, excellent landscape plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the board members on my,
I have a 46 member pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell people, I'm so grateful
they all come to the meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never been able to decide a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all agree, these are the best
landscape peonies on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're particularly nice performers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a moot.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surefire rose, another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from PW.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their pink variety, and they have a
surefire red to go along with it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it resembles those other
cultivars very strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be duplication, but that's a
good thing, in my opinion, for a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because should there be some subtle nuance
that's been creating a problem for one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those introductions, perhaps the others
will not be impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good opportunity to check
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Satata does a great job with their
impatience lines too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really advocating that folks
grow the wall or anise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand our virgin is working on
developing some disease resistance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall or anise lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the customers love them and the
nurseries and greenhouse operations would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to market those plants as they were
the number one petting plant in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, we can grow these
beautiful new guineas and hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a meek and camp variety,
Carmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of these non-stock types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous, beautiful flower, lovely size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is my favorite, Chloe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's my pastel color
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get my wife and daughter arguing
about flower colors, because Maritza,
[SPEAKER_00]: my daughter, is an art graduate from
Temple High Art School.
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves the rich, strong, vibrant
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife, being conservative,
she's traditional, prefers the pastels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun to get those discussions going
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Chloe in all her glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice apricot variety,
which again is a great flower size and
[SPEAKER_00]: real attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a number of angel wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard to get a good picture
of this unless you want to lie on your
[SPEAKER_00]: back and shoot up a pot or get somebody to
hold the pot up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any event, this is a very good
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great for trailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have that wonderful solid
white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I've run the gamut of my
time schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you all very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you, if you have not
visited the Penn State Flower Trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Longwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Chanticleer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as somebody once told me, there are
more botanic gardens that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is too healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than anywhere else in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much flied for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you to come see us down
the lanes.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a little work to be done
in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have had sporadic rain,
where we've gotten over 1.4, 1.6,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 2 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has created some flower injury
after the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep my eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that point up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what Daryl Abs used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I want to open my window at 5.30
PM and hear that thwop, thwop,
[SPEAKER_00]: thwopping sound of all the name only
flowers falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to chop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, they're not the lovely,
innocent forms that we would like to see.
Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't consider myself a tomato flavor
expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd say the little birdies picked on
my salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trialgardenpsu.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a .edu site, because IT looked at
the plexia and ran away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you can Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do Penn State Flower Trials
