[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I think most of you know,
or now all of you definitely know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Tier, I'm in Rebecca's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today I'm going to be talking about
basically two very different views,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a very micro and a very macro view of
the same pathos system, the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mase-Cedestria-Tursica pathos system
disease pictured here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've kind of introduced or really been
focusing or thinking about this
[SPEAKER_03]: intellectual model, I guess, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like paradigm of different scales of
resistance in Rebecca's lab in the past
[SPEAKER_03]: few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of moving from the molecular scale
of resistance, like chemical warfare,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the interactions of different
genes, all the way up to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: What genes are deployed where?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's being grown where?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the epidemiology of the pathogen?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to look at each of these, you know,
you obviously need to construct a
[SPEAKER_03]: different experiment to explore each of
these things at its own scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's what we've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the molecular, you know, on the
molecular side of things, the molecular
[SPEAKER_03]: scope of things, you know, use an RNA-seq
experiment to see what genes, what
[SPEAKER_03]: pathways, what molecular mechanisms are
important at a given time.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the tissue side of things, you know,
the pathogen is moving through a
[SPEAKER_03]: three-dimensional leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not homogenous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been doing histopathology
experiments to study that.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the plot level, you know, gene mapping,
looking at resistance in the field,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, on a road-to-road basis,
looking at natural diversity, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the landscape level now,
you know, just in the past two years,
[SPEAKER_03]: moving to aerial photography and drones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like Rebecca said,
I've been involved in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growth chamber experiments,
RNA-seq experiments, histopathology
[SPEAKER_03]: things, often kind of like jumping in on
different projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mase transposing mutagenesis was one of my
main projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gene mapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypothenotyping, writing a couple of
reviews at the BECCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to basically focus on two
main things, you know, dividing it up into
[SPEAKER_03]: this micro and macro view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Micro being an RNA-seq experiment using R
gene isolines that we're wrapping up the
[SPEAKER_03]: paper now for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the macro scale, what's been
funding me for the past two years,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a phenomixer, hypothenotyping
project about aerial imaging of northern
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some background.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've heard me talk basically ever in
the past five years, or if you've been in
[SPEAKER_03]: a cornfield, you're familiar with northern
leaf light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fungal disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a foliar disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: It occurs in cool, wet areas, like central
New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes these nasty necrotic lesions
that you can see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you might imagine, that's going to
lead to lower yield and also lower silage
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fewer available nutrients, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of quantifying its effect,
about NOV specifically, there's been,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, new interest, a resurgence
of interest in the past few years because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been becoming a more serious problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some estimates of, you know,
estimated yield loss from 2016 for the
[SPEAKER_03]: years prior.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the best estimate of this team
of plant pathologists was that in 2015,
[SPEAKER_03]: NOV was accounting for about 25% of all
May's disease yield loss, incurring a
[SPEAKER_03]: penalty or economic loss of about $2
billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it always looks more dramatic and
striking when you see it in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a photo taken by our log time lab
manager, Judy Kolkman, not far from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can see is that, you know,
when you have the right weather
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions, which we often do in central
New York, when you have the pathogen
[SPEAKER_03]: population there, when you have a
non-resistant or susceptible variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can get these devastating
outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The causal agent is this fungus,
Cetasferia turcica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the really critical things,
I think, first and foremost, about its
[SPEAKER_03]: biology are, one, it's hemibiotropic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, it starts as a biotrope,
feeding off living May's cells,
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding off living tissue, and essentially
trying to avoid detection or avoiding
[SPEAKER_03]: detection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it switches into a necrotrophic
phase, in which it's killing off the host
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue and living off that dead tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the necrotic lesions that you
saw, you know, before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also haploid, like most fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it mostly, so it can undergo sexual
reproduction of meiosis, but mostly it's
[SPEAKER_03]: asexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the asexual spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a vast source of, you know,
inoculum and the disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how you get these, like,
lineages that cover a large area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does pathogenesis look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a freeze frame from a video that
I'll play in just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is from one of the histopathology
experiments I was running in the growth
[SPEAKER_03]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the orange is the May's leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green is the fungal tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can see is there's a
canidium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the asexual spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousands or tens of thousands of them
land on the leaf, germinate, and try to
[SPEAKER_03]: penetrate the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows through the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after, I don't know, between one
and three weeks, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_03]: are and the resistance, et cetera,
et cetera, it's going to reach the xylem
[SPEAKER_03]: and it colonizes the xylem very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's moving along the xylem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can branch out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you get those, you know,
long, skinny lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's moving along the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a video, both that shows it in a
little bit clearer detail and also it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just very neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a single spore that you're,
you know, looking at in extremely fine
[SPEAKER_03]: detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you see this, so this is,
you know, probably on this tissue,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would not be able to see any sort of
lesion, you know, just with your eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually what's going to happen is
that it'll keep going throughout this
[SPEAKER_03]: vascular bundle or keep going throughout
that xylem, expand, branch out into other
[SPEAKER_03]: vascular bundle, into other parts of
vascular tissue, and eventually clog it,
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially, and start killing off the
host tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we know about NLB resistance?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot, but quickly summarizing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's this kind of
dichotomy of quality and quantitative
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start with qualitative,
so like R gene mediated resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four canonical, so to speak,
long-known R genes, the HT genes,
[SPEAKER_03]: in this pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: HT is short for Helminthosporium tersicum,
an outdated name for the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of like with the standard
gene-for-gene model, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as expected, you've got this gene-for-gene
interaction with AVRHT genes, AVRHT genes
[SPEAKER_03]: in the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are from, I think, some greenhouse
experiments by a former grad student of
[SPEAKER_03]: Rebecca's, Chaolin Chung.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, here's it without an R gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's it with one of two different R
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the interesting things about just
even with only these four genes is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we have different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of these, even on the,
like, level that's visible to your eye,
[SPEAKER_03]: are affecting the pathogen in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So HT2 that you can see here doesn't delay
the formation of lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still show up around 10 days
afterwards, but it does slow their growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get lots of this parotic
yellowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's clear on the TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And HTN, you know, pictured here on the
right, it does not slow the rate of growth
[SPEAKER_03]: of the lesions, but it does greatly delay
their formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good, you know, acting at
different points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resistance is not all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the interesting things is that,
so far, so not many of these genes are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually confirmed and known or cloned,
but of the two that are, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, they're not the standard sort
of R gene and AVR gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the R gene that is cloned is HTN,
which is a wall-associated kinase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is not, most R genes
in the kind of canonical model or the
[SPEAKER_03]: typical R gene, you know, is a cytosolic
gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cytosolic gene with a nucleotide
binding and a leucine-rich repeat domain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And HTN is not this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of part of the smaller category,
like a fourth to a third of known R genes
[SPEAKER_03]: that are not really fitting in that mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: AVR-HT1 in the fungus, which Gillian
Turgeon's group has been working on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, most fungal effector genes are
small-secreted proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're about 20 amino acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fungus secretes them, and they
interfere with the host defenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: AVR-HT1 is not that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather, it's a secondary metabolite gene
that has both polyketide synthase and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-ribosomal peptide synthase domains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's making its, you know, it is a
protein which is assembling other very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very small proteins, endotetides.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously, four R genes is not
the entire of what we know about
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of quantitative resistance,
you know, I'm dividing these up,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, it is a spectrum,
and I think everybody kind of operates
[SPEAKER_03]: with this idea that, you know,
both are these two kinds, but there is a
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum, obviously, between quantitative
and qualitative resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of quantitative, you know,
there's lots of QTLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of diversity for resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an image I really like from
Jesse Polin's paper on NOB resistance in
[SPEAKER_03]: the maize-NAM population, and you can just
see that, you know, this is what the range
[SPEAKER_03]: of natural diversity in terms of NOB
resistance looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Randy Weisser, one of Rebecca's old
students or former students, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: did a meta-analysis just from a few
different mapping studies, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the NOB QTL from, I think,
five mapping studies covered 40 percent of
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetic map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse found 29 QTL, and you can see from
down here, you know, most of the QTL are
[SPEAKER_03]: present across, or at least the loci,
have diversity across most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I won't cover this,
but I think it's an interesting parallel
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of to what we see with the R genes,
specifically HT2 and HTN, is that Chao Lin
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheng, another former grad student of
Rebecca's, did this really interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: work about QTL isolines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So QTL also can have different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was working with these two,
QTL isolated from the resistant line,
[SPEAKER_03]: TEX303, you know, both on chromosome 1,
but fairly far apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them basically made the leaf
harder to penetrate, so fewer knidia could
[SPEAKER_03]: penetrate, but it didn't slow their
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them slowed the growth
post-penetration, but didn't significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce their ability to penetrate the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we already are going into this
with this idea of, like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're operating at different points
spatially, temporally, chemically,
[SPEAKER_03]: etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving on to what I've been working on,
again, the micro scale is mostly going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be about this RNA-seq experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the experimental design of this
basically has two parts, because we're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in looking at multiple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first part is the host and pathogen
combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are inoculating one of two Mase
hosts, which does or does not have the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mase R gene, HT2, with one of two pathogen
isolates, which do have their own genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: differences, but the critical one is that
they either have the wild type,
[SPEAKER_03]: capital letters, avirulence gene,
or the non-wild type, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: little letters, avirulence gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what that means in terms of R gene
and AVR gene, so this is kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: classic gene for gene model of R genes,
is that if you have the R gene and the
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen has the cognate wild type AVR
gene, you know, we say wild type,
[SPEAKER_03]: recognizable AVR gene, avirulence gene,
you induce this resistance reaction like
[SPEAKER_03]: the one we saw a few slides before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You induce that chlorosis and that
restricted lesion growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, you know, the host is missing the R
gene, obviously it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible, whereas susceptible is your
background line is, or if the pathogen has
[SPEAKER_03]: the non-recognizable form of this AVR
locus, it's going to be a susceptible
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second component of it is that we also
want to know about this biotropy-necotropy
[SPEAKER_03]: transition, because hemi-biotropes are,
they're a really interesting model because
[SPEAKER_03]: you can compare them both to biotropic
fungi and to necotropic fungi,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's hemi-biotropy that works
differently among, you know, different
[SPEAKER_03]: clades of organisms and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in here what we were doing,
you know, the biotropy-necotropy
[SPEAKER_03]: transition in most germplasm in a growth
chamber happens typically before 10 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: usually around 8 or 9 days after you
inoculate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we sampled at four different time
points, days post-inoculation,
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, 5, 7, and 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've got three time points within
the biotrophic phase and then 10 time
[SPEAKER_03]: points in the necotrophic phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's appropriate negative
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, mock-inoculated maize plants
on the host side, on the pathogen side we
[SPEAKER_03]: have just pathogen isolates growing in a,
you know, petri-dition culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of questions that we
have asked and have answered and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that I think are really
fascinating, but I'm really going to focus
[SPEAKER_03]: on a small set of them under kind of two
umbrellas, the first being the exploratory
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, like an RNA-seq data set or
any, you know, large-scale data set has a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of exploratory questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that, you know, I think are
really fascinating for this are what does
[SPEAKER_03]: the biotropy-necotropy transition look
like in both the host and the pathogen?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the difference between a resistant
and susceptible interaction?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we have HT2 mapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have AVR HT2 mapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, somewhere in our transcript
reads are the genes we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we use, like, wise things,
like wise criteria to narrow down our very
[SPEAKER_03]: long candidate list?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, keeping this experiment straight,
I think this is the most helpful plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have is on the x-axis the days
post-inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each line is a host-pathogen combination
and the y-axis is basically what
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage of the reads aligned to the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, essentially fungal biomass by
percentage of the samples we're taking
[SPEAKER_03]: from those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing to point out is that,
you know, between seven and ten days,
[SPEAKER_03]: what does the biotropy-necotropy
transition look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Among other things, it's a rapid increase
in fungal biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really when it takes off,
once it hits that xylem tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't show the PCAs, but essentially
from three, five, and seven days during
[SPEAKER_03]: this biotropic phase, the pathogens gene
expression is the same at all those time
[SPEAKER_03]: points.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just reaching for the xylem,
not much is changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one is that, you know,
this is what an RG mediator resistance
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: HD2 is inhibiting the growth of New York 1
because New York 1 has the recognizable
[SPEAKER_03]: form of the AVR HD2 locus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what we think of as the wild
type.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third point is that HD2 does not have
an effect on the 28A isolate, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is an isolate which is
carrying the non-recognizable form,
[SPEAKER_03]: or we think of, you know, it's either
mutated or missing or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: or there's somehow different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it does not have an effect on
the growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fourth one, and I don't touch on
this, I won't touch on this in the
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion, but it's a really fascinating
point, is that 28A is essentially a better
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've always noticed this,
you know, anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who's worked with these two
isolates has seen, like, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: this one's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one doesn't grow super well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't affect super well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are also able, and I won't,
like, go into this at all, but we are also
[SPEAKER_03]: able to say, okay, what's the difference
between when you have no R gene,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, they're both susceptible
interactions, what do a weak and a strong
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does a host responding to a weak
and a strong pathogen look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are they different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these isolates, in a lot of genes,
in, like, a lot of portions of the genome
[SPEAKER_03]: are 100% identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing people like to ask when they
do a paired RNA-seq experiment,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the common thing is to say,
okay, when I infect this host with NLB,
[SPEAKER_03]: or when I spray NLB onto this host,
you know, looking at both genomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: both transcriptomes, what do the genes do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they go up or down?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, characterize that in
some sort of intelligible way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've worked pretty hard to basically,
you know, change this from a list of
[SPEAKER_03]: 200,000 P values into something,
you know, tangible or understandable or
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can put in sort of literature
form, you know, prose, as it were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we found basically was the
most useful or the most informative was
[SPEAKER_03]: using PFAM domains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what sort of proteins are they
predicted to be in the host and pathogen?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we can separate them
out and kind of parse and break this down
[SPEAKER_03]: into, you know, an understanding of it
biologically by separating out by time,
[SPEAKER_03]: by host, and by pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to focus here on maze
domains, breaking down kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biotrophy and necrotrophy domains that I
think tell a really interesting story
[SPEAKER_03]: about what hemibiotrophy looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this figure is is a subsection of
a figure from the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: On each row are the different PFAM terms,
and I'll go through them and kind of what
[SPEAKER_03]: the significance is.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the columns are the time points,
3, 5, 7, and 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then each of those four squares is
basically our four combinations of host
[SPEAKER_03]: and pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took a lot of finagling to get a lot of
stuff onto this figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so some things that we've found,
we would have been more surprised if they
[SPEAKER_03]: hadn't shown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during these are PFAM domains which are
enriched among the maze genes upregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: during biotrophy, you know, 3,
5, 7, 10 days predominantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first is, you know, leucine
retrorepeats and nucleotide binding
[SPEAKER_03]: domains, and in this pathosystem as well,
wall-associated kinases.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those are the classical form of
genes which detect fungal effectors and or
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's something that's totally not
surprising to see, and we see it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we know of, especially about NBLR
gene regulation, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: once the plant detects that there is a
microbe, you know, attempting to infect
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaf, it upregulates, like,
all of these genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things basically are attested to in
the literature for other diseases,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're kind of, this is the first
time that they're popping up on our radar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lectins are, you know, an antimicrobial
protein that's been studying a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other pathosystems, but we've never looked
at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of raises a new hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things are not very well-attested in
the disease literature, but we can kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: make sense of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plaque 8 is a domain originally
characterized in humans, which is why it's
[SPEAKER_03]: placenta specific 8, but we can kind of
make sense of it because when you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: what this gene does in plants,
you know, there's a common implication of
[SPEAKER_03]: it sensing mechanical damage, and it's
involved in calcium signaling,
[SPEAKER_03]: things that make a lot of sense in terms
of disease response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get these things that are
very, very strange, and I actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I find these extremely exciting
because so many chromosome maintenance
[SPEAKER_03]: genes, the class of DNA helicases,
they've been implicated in diseases,
[SPEAKER_03]: but only in diseases where unconstrained
DNA replication is a logical part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: life cycle and of the disease's strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like soybean cyst nematode,
they're trying to induce like rapid
[SPEAKER_03]: unconstrained cell proliferation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time MCM genes are
showing up, and even there it's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: limited in terms of the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time it's showing up in
a disease like this where you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: inducement by the pathogen of
unconstrained cell growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, you know, general way to kind of wave
it away is like maybe this is a generalist
[SPEAKER_03]: stress response because MCM genes have
also been implicated in response to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, salt stress and drought stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this kind of crazy hypothesis that
it could be involved in neutrophil
[SPEAKER_03]: extracellular traps, that is unspooled
chromatin that the plant releases to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, trap up the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason why this is kind of a
crazy out-there hypothesis, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really exciting to see something that
is just not present in the literature,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're the first to see this and
notice this very strong signal for these
[SPEAKER_03]: genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, moving to necrotrophy,
I'm going to kind of skip over the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that are induced throughout the whole life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are the whole, you know,
range of times straight to, so these are
[SPEAKER_03]: PFAM domains, which are up-regulated or
many of them are up-regulated by the host
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically during necrotrophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, you know, what we get is the
ability to put this into words that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: understand and kind of synthesize with our
understanding of biology instead of just a
[SPEAKER_03]: long list of p-values and up-regulation
like log changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So adaptins and ADP ribosolation factors,
ARF genes, you know, if you're familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with them, they're really involved in
vesicle secretion, the secretion of
[SPEAKER_03]: xenobiotic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, glutathione S-transferases,
GSTs, are a class of genes we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: interested for like, you know,
now what, like a decade, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have known roles in
detoxification of pathogen compounds and
[SPEAKER_03]: in response to necrotrophs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, you know, sometimes you
just get NAM, no apical meristem,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just a class of transcription factor
domain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be doing a million different
things, it's kind of hard to parse out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it is good to know that that is there
and recognize it and keep it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: literature in like a usable form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these lines were made, or these lines
that we were using were ISA lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: either do or don't carry the HT2R gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we know about HT2, so it has been
mapped to a pretty small region of
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome 8 by two of Rebecca's former
students, you know, it's mapped pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is incredibly near the HTNR gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that was a wall-associated
kinase, not the kind of cytosolic NBS LRR
[SPEAKER_03]: gene that is common for RG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a whole lot of kinase genes
in that region that are like, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: dozens and dozens of pretty plausible
candidates when you just look at,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, what genes are here?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we think they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they look like known resistance genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that we are, you know,
we're using the mantra like, work hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: not work hard, you know, somewhere in
these reads, in the transcript reads,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have the RNA sequence, the coding
sequence of HT2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we use intelligible criteria,
you know, to basically parse out our very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very long list of candidates?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we just came up with a list,
you know, one by one of these logical
[SPEAKER_03]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be in or near the mapping
region, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's precisely mapped, but, you know,
it could be at least a few hundred KB
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it make sense in terms of what sort
of gene it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it polymorphic?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it compare also to what's already
been sequenced in Nase that has genome
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it expressed in the leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's not expressed baseline,
you know, just in a non-inocular leaf,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not induced, it's probably not
doing anything for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as well, does it have higher
expression in HT2?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are R genes where there is,
you know, there are cases where it's not
doing anything for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are cases where there is no
polymorphism between two alleles of an R
[SPEAKER_03]: gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the regulatory control of it
instead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of looked at all these logical
criteria, and it allowed us to narrow down
[SPEAKER_03]: our list from 100, 200 genes pretty
narrowly down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have two strong candidates
for HT2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think especially one of the nice
things is when you go in and look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence of these reads, you know,
you can find things that before were
[SPEAKER_03]: really at the top of our list.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say, oh, this makes perfect sense for
HT2.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a perfect candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you look and you say,
there's no polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expressed exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't find any difference between
these two genes, between the isolines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we can use what we have in hand
to say, that needs to go down the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: This other one needs to move up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one is, again, these are both
the protein kinases, things involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: signal detection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has homology to a wall-associated
kinase in rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's close-ish to the mapping center,
not as close as we would like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, at first we were looking at,
OK, let's just look at the five genes
[SPEAKER_03]: right near the mapping thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know that recombination can be kind
of iffy in this region.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's expressed in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is induced by NLB infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's polymorphic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other nice thing is that the HT2
minus allele pretty closely matches B73,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we know does not have HT2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it fits in with what we know about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did look at other genomes, because a
lot more and more are being sequenced
[SPEAKER_03]: every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not as confident about whether
or not those genomes have HT2,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second one, you know, again, we've got a
leucine-rich repeat domain, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: classical domain involving, you know,
associated with disease resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a protein kinase.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got much higher expression in our HT2
plus isoline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the HT2 minus allele, which is from a
line S11, which is fairly similar to B73,
[SPEAKER_03]: closely resembles B73s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, obviously, we would need
to, we have some money for transgenic or
[SPEAKER_03]: transformation with Nat Willman in the new
plant transformation facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all these need to be confirmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the nice thing about looking
at what you have in hand is that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: turn a list of dozens of barely possible
candidates that are all vaguely on equal
[SPEAKER_03]: footing into two much stronger key bits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving from these kind of exploratory
questions into the more hypothesis-driven
[SPEAKER_03]: one, you know, we also do have things that
we, hypotheses that we bring to the
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment and say, we want to know if
this is true in our system or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the two we'll focus on are on the host
side, gene expression versus resistance in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field, and on the pathogen side,
gene-sparse wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hypothesis that we're bringing to
the table in terms of NLB phenotype in the
[SPEAKER_03]: field is that NLB resistance is related to
the baseline expression, the non-induced
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of non-inocular plants of genes
that are upregulated in response to NLB.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of reasons why this is,
you know, a moderately plausible
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothesis or this might be the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, lines can have, a resistant line
might have high, like what we call a hair
[SPEAKER_03]: trigger, might have high sensitivity
towards fungal domains or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: microbial signals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have really high baseline
expression, you know, basically
[SPEAKER_03]: pre-constituted defenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also a lot of reasons why this
would totally not be the case because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, induced express, induced
defenses and baseline, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: constitutive defenses are different for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't always want to be panicking and
have all of your defensive mechanisms
[SPEAKER_03]: firing in all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also it was because, you know,
one of the reasons why he brought us to
[SPEAKER_03]: the table is we had the data to ask this
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl Kremling published a paper this year
which I think a lot of people saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you saw his exit seminar, it's really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he, you know, uploaded all the
data from this and it is gene expression
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lot of different tissues for the Mays
282 diversity panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of diverse lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy Kolkman has taken NLB resistance
metrics on the same panel so we can
[SPEAKER_03]: compare the expression of genes in
multiple tissues to what, how resistant is
[SPEAKER_03]: the adult plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: The way we're doing that is just with
ridge regression.
[SPEAKER_03]: We measure the accuracy of our predictions
by tenfold cross validation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this metric of, okay, you know,
our is related is kind of a vague term.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're looking for is how well can we
predict NLB resistance from expression of
[SPEAKER_03]: these genes using those as the predictors?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we have here is the y-axis is
the correlation between the predicted and
[SPEAKER_03]: the observed values.
[SPEAKER_03]: The x-axis is how many genes we're using
to predict.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether those genes, the two panels,
are whether those genes are just randomly
[SPEAKER_03]: sampled from the genome after we filtered
for, you know, they should be expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be a useful predictor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to throw garbage in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they from our list of kind of NLB
induced genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as you can see, you know,
in both of them, as you add more
[SPEAKER_03]: predictors, you get a better prediction,
you know, as you expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we see is when you're using a
small amount of genes, that should
[SPEAKER_03]: actually be 0.16, couldn't change that,
but it's about twice as good when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using NLB induced genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I mean by twice as good is
that if you limit your predictors to genes
[SPEAKER_03]: which are induced by NLB and you say,
from these I will predict NLB resistance
[SPEAKER_03]: in adult plants, you do about twice as
good a job as just using expression of
[SPEAKER_03]: some randomly sampled genes in the same
number.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you increase the number of genes,
they get, you know, more similar because
[SPEAKER_03]: if you just increase the number to 35,000
genes, you'd be using the exact same gene
[SPEAKER_03]: sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be using all of the genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're using 3,000, you know,
there's still about a 0.1 bump in
[SPEAKER_03]: prediction accuracy when you're limiting
this to say, I want to only use genes that
[SPEAKER_03]: are responsive to NLB to predict the adult
NLB phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited by this because we
kind of hit a lot of dead ends on other
[SPEAKER_03]: similar questions and we found it's really
interesting, you know, result out of
[SPEAKER_03]: looking through Carl's data.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second hypothesis I want to touch on
is that gene sparse regions tend to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: tend to have more pathogenesis related
genes, whereas gene rich regions will tend
[SPEAKER_03]: to have more, you know, basic life cycle
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reasons for this are kind of
numerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming out of, this model is
coming out of Safiyan Kamoon's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you have a gene sparse
region, there's going to be more strands
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're going to have more mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the third one is not necessarily
implied by being gene sparse, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of the other metrics of
whether it's related to pathogenesis is
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed in planta.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found, which was really
interesting, is basically one half of this
[SPEAKER_03]: model applied to our system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a heat map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genes are binned in the X and Y axis by
their distance to the nearest neighbor in
[SPEAKER_03]: the three prime and five prime direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the color is of all the genes that are
that far from the nearest neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the mean ratio log transform of
their implant expression to their control
[SPEAKER_03]: expression on a plate?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is that, you know,
there's that red patch in the corner of
[SPEAKER_03]: genes that are far from both of their
nearest neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if a gene is over 10 kb from a
neighboring gene on either side,
[SPEAKER_03]: the average ratio of implanta to a xenic
expression is about 200 versus a baseline
[SPEAKER_03]: of about one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see that playing out essentially in
our pathosystem, you know, gene sparse
[SPEAKER_03]: regions do have genes that are highly
expressed in planta.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't see the other half of the
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a similar model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a similar heat map.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got kb in both directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the color scale is the mean log
transform dNDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: A low dNDS means you have very few
non-synonymous substitutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is, you know, anything new is
being purged.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stabilizing selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: A very high dNDS is you've got,
you know, selection for diversity,
[SPEAKER_03]: functional diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially what we saw is that,
you know, genes and gene sparse regions
[SPEAKER_03]: were not any faster to evolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we only get half of the model being
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So backing up, you know, somewhat,
backing up to our entire model that we
[SPEAKER_03]: think about resistance under, we've been
looking really at the molecular scale,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, been looking at just a few
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you know, our group does a lot
of field work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move over to the extremely,
extremely macro scale and thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: things on, you know, rather than thinking
about them on the tiny centimeter sample
[SPEAKER_03]: scale, think about them on the meters and
kilometers or at least acres scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the project that's been funding me for
the past two years has been basically
[SPEAKER_03]: centered around detecting NOB lesions from
aerial images, from UAVs, unmanned aerial
[SPEAKER_03]: vehicles, which is how everybody prefers
to say drones now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds friendlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's lots of reasons you know,
I think many of us now have heard various
[SPEAKER_03]: justifications for why phenotyping is
useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you want to have, you want to
remove that bottleneck on all of your
[SPEAKER_03]: progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be, have phenotyping that's on
the same scale and speed and accuracy as
[SPEAKER_03]: your genotyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: But specifically about NOB, you know,
in this specific context, why would you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of two groups of answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is for breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think probably the most
relevant answer is that if you are already
[SPEAKER_03]: flying a drone, which I think is going to
be more and more common for more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding programs, you know, if you
already have the images adding on and you
[SPEAKER_03]: already have a pipeline that is fairly
simple to use, adding on another trait is
[SPEAKER_03]: much less difficult than, you know,
doubling the amount of traits you score in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously we want higher
precision and accuracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jesse Poland from our lab did some
studies on human accuracy for NOB.
[SPEAKER_03]: Short answer is people are good,
but there's certainly room for
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think one, especially relevant
for NOB is that the main metric we take is
[SPEAKER_03]: after flowering, so that in a breeding
program, what we measure is later in the
[SPEAKER_03]: season, you know, far after flowering,
what we measure is the percentage of
[SPEAKER_03]: disease leaf area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to score a large area for
pre-flowering disease traits because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for pretty rare lesions or
you're looking for something pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this would, you know,
if you can measure something
[SPEAKER_03]: pre-flowering, you can also choose the
male parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you theoretically double your
gains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, you know, we don't work really
in management.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really work on the fungicides or
things of that nature, but we want to also
[SPEAKER_03]: be aware of how this could be useful for
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think similar thing, more traits at
once.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, all growers want to
know whether it's worth it to spray their
[SPEAKER_03]: fields with fungicide, given corn prices
and the probability of disease loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one that's pretty, you know,
like far out in the future, but a few
[SPEAKER_03]: groups are working on is variable rate
fungicide application.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is really exciting for larger
areas, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a wet spot in your field,
that's the one that's going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: hammered most likely with disease worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you can, or if, you know,
it's coming from one direction,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can use the epidemiology of
it to save money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did this project work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have field experiments of
various sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take drone images of them, thanks to
tireless work from Ethan Casmar from Mike
[SPEAKER_03]: Gore's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go into some of the troubleshooting of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use human annotations, so basically,
showing where the lesions are,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we feed that into a convolutional
neural network, a CNN.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to explain this briefly
and clearly what a CNN is, because I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's relevant for how all this project
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a CNN is a class of machine learning
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the current standard for recognizing
objects from images, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just in an automated sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you upload a picture to Facebook,
and it says, oh, this is Kyle's face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to tag Kyle in this?
[SPEAKER_03]: What it is using is a CNN that has been
trained on images of Kyle's face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what it's using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same with, you know,
all of Google's things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any self-driving car are using this basic
formal model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds more complicated than the math
behind it actually is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The central things are these convolutional
layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So convolution is a mathematical function
that you can apply to matrices.
[SPEAKER_03]: These layers have filters, which are
different matrices.
[SPEAKER_03]: You slide the matrix across an image,
which can also be thought of as a matrix
[SPEAKER_03]: of n dimensions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then essentially what it gives you is
it gives you a high value essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: where it sees a type of feature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the bottom layer, it's a pretty
simple feature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be vertical lines or the color
blue or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a pooling layer, which all that is
is it's down sampling the resolution,
[SPEAKER_03]: like when you shrink an image.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a higher convolutional layer
that is looking at combinations of the
[SPEAKER_03]: previous filters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time you move up a layer,
you're looking at more and more complex
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations of the layers below.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you get to something on the third
level, that's where you start seeing,
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, one of these 256 filters is going to
respond to lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're optimizing it for faces,
this is going to respond to Kyle's face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ultimately, you can use that to
predict whether there's a lesion in the
[SPEAKER_03]: image or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first phase is the majority of it,
which is annotate lesions, train the
[SPEAKER_03]: neural network, and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have multiple field experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always running different disease
trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to image those.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of challenges to imaging
an entire field at the level where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see NLB lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, these things are centimeters to
millimeters in size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you capture the images.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want these to be really high
resolution, much higher than people are
[SPEAKER_03]: normally taking when they use drones in
the anatomy, which means that you need low
[SPEAKER_03]: altitude, which gives you low coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be flying slowly because we
don't want motion blur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we analyze the images, we can't trust
just anybody to analyze NLB.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way that Google and Facebook do it
is they outsource all of their annotations
[SPEAKER_03]: by looking at who you've tagged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time that the website asks you if
you're a human or not, and it says,
[SPEAKER_03]: click on all of the street signs or
transcribe this image or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are using you to outsource what they
want to train a self-driving car to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've used you to outsource all that
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, a random person can't just
say, oh, this is NLB.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also need a vast amount of people data
to train a CNN.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of run out this thing of human
annotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a wall that we climbed over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I mean by human annotation is we
first tried just saying, OK, here's images
[SPEAKER_03]: with NLB.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the ones without.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't work super well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we moved to kind of the next level of
detail, which is, OK, here's a picture,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of lesions in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually off a drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not cropped at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the actual resolution that we were
getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw a line down the axis, do it for the
next lesion, do it for the next lesion,
[SPEAKER_03]: do it for all the lesions of the image,
and then do that 100,000 more times.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can imagine, this was not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mind-boggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, that's the scale that we
needed to train these models accurately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so ultimately, what we do is then feed
them into the CNN.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some really great computer science
collaborators, formerly at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_03]: now at Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the simplest view, what can we now
do that we could not before?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take a handheld image, feed it
through our network that has been trained
[SPEAKER_03]: on tens of thousands of examples of what a
lesion looks like and where it is in an
[SPEAKER_03]: image.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get out a heat map where it says,
I think these regions are NLB.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do the same with an aerial image.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is a non-crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is straight off the drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can feed that into the network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can see this is a little bit
grainier, as it were.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, black is where it sees the lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just flipping from one to the other,
you can see, OK, it's getting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting this little one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before I get to the question that's the
natural next question, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: how well are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how good of a job are we doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to bring in one last point,
which is the idea of consensus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So similar to when you have a jar full of
jelly beans, and if you have three people
[SPEAKER_03]: guess, the mean of their guess is almost
always going to be better than any
[SPEAKER_03]: individual guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consensus of multiple people with the
mean of their guess is usually the most
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same concept here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you subsample your image data and your
training data slightly differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: train three slightly different CNNs,
you'll get three slightly different
[SPEAKER_03]: predictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose that same image.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are the three A, B, and C we were
calling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the heat maps from the three
prediction networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see this one maybe is the one
on the left is maybe a little bit too
small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe too sensitive, but that could be
useful when you're looking under different
[SPEAKER_03]: light conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how good of a job do these networks do?
[SPEAKER_03]: On handheld images, it's reaching
ultimately about 97% accuracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the validation set here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got like 90% accuracy with each
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you combine them,
you get about 98.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between a validation and a
test set is that a validation set is one
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can test how good you're doing
and then maybe go back and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, this method didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go use this method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the test set you leave until the
very end and only look at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you optimize your model by
looking at how it does in the validation
[SPEAKER_03]: set and then you test it on the validation
set, obviously it's going to do a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the UAV images, here's on the x-axis
you can see the epochs, which is like the
[SPEAKER_03]: different rounds of optimization of the
CNN.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the y-axis is the accuracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ultimately hit test set accuracy of
about 95%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 95% is fairly good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can imagine if you were flying
over a field and you looked at 100,000
[SPEAKER_03]: corn plants, you'd be getting 5,000 false
positives as NOB is here, where it's not,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is unacceptable for if you're trying
to screen a large area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we want to do, what I'm working on
right now is basically supplementing
[SPEAKER_03]: annotations using crowdsourcing to improve
our network's performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is what we were doing so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally just went through and drew
lines at 100,000 lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And used that to train the network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had talked about using polygons
circling the lesions, but we just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no way we can make that many.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too much of a time constraint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why do we want polygons?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an image from a group actually
also at Cornell who's training a network
[SPEAKER_03]: to recognize materials like carpet,
wood, and cement, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what their network saw when it was
trained on point clicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something like click three points on
the carpet, click three points on
[SPEAKER_03]: something made of wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what it saw when it was fed
polygons of that same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see, you're getting these crisp
annotations because you're feeding it a
[SPEAKER_03]: vast amount more data.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you circle all of the points that are
wood, or carpet, or whatever, then just
[SPEAKER_03]: clicking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're essentially on the same points
one and two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have over images.
[SPEAKER_03]: We train them on fairly low resolution
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're getting these kind of blobs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It knows there is a lesion there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has learned to recognize lesions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not getting these crisp
outlines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to get polygon annotations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the task is fairly straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw boundaries around all lesions in this
image.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that 100,000 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that we kind of went around
this is divided up into two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already done this thing on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the lesion, which we tried shopping
that out to anonymous online workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not trained pathologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen northern leaf light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we found is that when we basically do
that and then pass it over to people who
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't experts, who just randomly hire for
this task, it actually works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I set up a platform on Amazon's
Mechanical Turk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were using it for a couple different
tests as well, working on annotation of
[SPEAKER_03]: grassy weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you can see is this is what we gave
to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got pretty minimal instruction,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mechanical Turk is an online platform
where you can hire people, anonymous
[SPEAKER_03]: online workers, for simple tasks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're typically paid by the task.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what the three people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see the outlines in red,
the area of all three in green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they honestly did a pretty good
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing that none of them had much
experience with this specific corn
[SPEAKER_03]: disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have been trained pathologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am just taking a stab that none of
these people, they just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: humans can recognize objects and file
directions fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other times, they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of this, there was just a lot of
data sanitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to happen with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you obviously are shopping
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three people do each task.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, it works fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were kind of thinking that this
mantra has come up a lot in the project
[SPEAKER_03]: with this fast, cheap, and good pick two.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of cheap, so we're paying about
$0.12 per lesion, $0.04 to each person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then one of that, they get three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one goes to Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's blazingly fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're actually paying a lot
more than most.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked at a lot of other people's
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're paying like several times more than
most other tasks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get it done in a few hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you post 10,000 things, it will be done
later that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the ultimate question is,
how is the quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are these people doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a histogram of the overlap
between all pairs of polygons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the overlap is the area of the
intersect of the two of them over the area
[SPEAKER_03]: of the union of both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much does it overlap?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's between pairs of polygons and one
set of annotations that I put up on MTurk.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you can see is basically three
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: First is that most of these annotations
are around 75% overlap, which when you
[SPEAKER_03]: look at it on an image, that's pretty good
for these things that are taken literally
[SPEAKER_03]: from a moving drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a small subset of workers who are
just drawing random garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it turns out actually, thankfully,
they're pretty easy to filter out because
[SPEAKER_03]: these lesions are only taking up like 10%,
5% of an image.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really easy to see when somebody
is just putting in garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found out that was actually pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a lot of the stuff in the middle
is also useful because what we found is
[SPEAKER_03]: that when you look at an image and you're
like, this is kind of blurry, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lesion here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you hand that image to three
people who are generally competent and
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to be doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of the three of them can agree on
where it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably gave them a bad image.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually serving as a nice,
I went back and looked at hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: these images where people who otherwise
generally did well could not agree on
[SPEAKER_03]: where the lesion was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a really nice test to basically
say, this image, we shouldn't be feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: this into our network.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's low quality.
There's blur.
[SPEAKER_03]: No three reasonable people can't agree on
what the lesion is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we're wrapping up the very last
piece, which is how much does this improve
[SPEAKER_03]: CNN performance?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we've got these things that basically
move from a crude line that is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: drawn down the axis of the lesion as best
I could get to these polygons,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much are we improved?
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, dipping back to the what can we
do side, it is exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our group was the first group who,
and I think still is the only group,
[SPEAKER_03]: who has done recognition of diseases in
the field of just images taken just
[SPEAKER_03]: without any sort of correction or clipping
of the leaf and putting it on background.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sort of thing that you could attach to
a tractor or just walk in the field,
[SPEAKER_03]: take on your smartphone with no
background, take from a drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is really exciting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, looking at this heat map,
we want to be able to get that more
[SPEAKER_03]: refined and do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving back to the micro and macro kind
of final thought section, as I'm writing
[SPEAKER_03]: things, and when you look at all the
projects together, it can seem kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: disparate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're like, OK, well,
here's an RNA-seq experiment, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: here's machine learning with drone images.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem kind of disparate, even though
they're about the same type of system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the valuable thing about that
is that there's plenty of stuff known and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's really fascinating literature and
components to each of these scales of
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to design different
experiments to understand each of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also, the different scales kind
of, how should I say this, cover for what
[SPEAKER_03]: the other scales can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're on the molecular scale,
you can see, OK, here's something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: invisible to the eye that's happening on
the molecular scale of this molecule
[SPEAKER_03]: interacting with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not always taken into account the
fact that the pathogen is moving through
[SPEAKER_03]: this three-dimensional leaf, which is
trying to fight it off in different ways
[SPEAKER_03]: at different points, three-dimensional
structure that fights that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're doing greenhouse and growth
chamber experiments, we don't usually have
[SPEAKER_03]: the room or the space or the ability or
the time to deploy things which is looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at diversity on the hundreds of plant
scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at natural diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do they perform in the field?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we perform in the field,
we're limited by how much humans can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone who does field work knows that at
some point, you just physically can't get
[SPEAKER_03]: any more hours out of the week and out of
your undergrads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're moving to this kind of final
scale where we're saying, we want this to
[SPEAKER_03]: be less and less constrained by just how
much we can walk and see in a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all of these are extremely
exciting scales to be studying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that, I have a lot of thanks,
as you can see, because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: have been incredibly excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rebecca has been a wonderful mentor,
both encouraging me to do more out there
[SPEAKER_03]: things like machine learning from drone
images, but also to focus and write my
[SPEAKER_03]: papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both keeping me on track and
encouraging me to try new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gillian Turgeon and Mike Gore,
it's incredibly valuable to have two
[SPEAKER_03]: people who have questions on like hardcore
fungal genetics and meiosis or on how we
[SPEAKER_03]: should be processing this data flow for
high-level phenotyping that have excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: people to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nelson Lab personnel and staff,
specifically our longtime lab manager,
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy Kolkman, who's my compatriot in the
field for basically all my field seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse and field personnel,
anyone who works in the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_03]: field knows that they're the ones who make
everything run.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nelson Lab has a wonderful cohort of
grad students, former and current,
[SPEAKER_03]: who are always giving really excellent
advice about everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethan and Nick from Mike Gore's lab are
the ones who forward a hucurean amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: effort to get our drone images taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lipson Lab at Columbia is our computer
science collaborators who have been really
[SPEAKER_03]: fruitful to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Synapsis is a wonderful organization,
and I say that not just pandering because
[SPEAKER_03]: most people in here are grad students,
but it's a great organization to just have
[SPEAKER_03]: lots of opportunities and outlets to talk
about plant biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the love and support and
scholarly mind of Lauren Brzezelski,
[SPEAKER_03]: who is flying back from Japan right now,
I think, and then funding from the NSF
[SPEAKER_03]: National Robotics Initiative in the past
two years, the NSF DR Mays grant right
[SPEAKER_03]: here for my first three years,
and the Joint Genome Institute,
[SPEAKER_03]: who funded a lot of the RNA sequencing,
fungal genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I will take questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time point is that three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any thoughts on what you could
find in those first three days that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in those other three, five,
seven, or ten days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably a lot, especially about the
germination success of the knidia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we spray knidia, these asexual
spores in the leaf, we're spraying
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands to tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really think, from looking at the
leaves, it's like not many of them succeed
[SPEAKER_03]: into becoming a lesion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's probably what we're
missing is the germination success of the
[SPEAKER_03]: knidia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's lots to miss there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the RNA-seq people that has come
out about estersica, that we were worried
[SPEAKER_03]: if that'd scoop us, that was really in
just the first three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, I think, their own time point
was like one day post-calculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I noticed that the images that were
taken by the drone had dark background.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so were they taken under special
circumstances, or I imagine that on a very
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, very sunny day, you'd have more of a
brownish, dirty background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would that influence their CNN
performance?
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked the nicest images.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question I did here is about these
have a dark background.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is obviously taken on a cloudy
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got really nice contrast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taken early-ish in the season where
everything's dark green still.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not the question, but I think
we're all at the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got this dark background where
the leaves really pop out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's bright and sunny, how does this
perform?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a lot of images that look a lot
worse than this, where the lesions are
[SPEAKER_03]: less clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have images from later in the season
where you start getting the confusing
[SPEAKER_03]: things of senescence of the lower leaves
versus what an NLB lesion is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have plenty of images where,
and especially, you can imagine with the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf, you get this big, sunny reflective
patch right where the leaf curls over
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're taking these images
straight down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the accuracy performance values
that you saw, the 95% to 98%, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: 95% to 97%, yeah, so those are all using,
that's using both shady images and sunny
[SPEAKER_03]: images.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's using images from earlier in the
season where things are still this dark
[SPEAKER_03]: blue-green, using things from later in the
season where things are starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: senesce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took a fair amount of pictures over
time courses in different positions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of a follow-up on Judy's
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sampling for your gene
expression D10, what tissue are you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the susceptible interaction,
a lot of it's presumably going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sampling was done basically around
the lesion for 10 days post-doculation
[SPEAKER_03]: with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you generally see, well, it'll take a
while for me to scroll back, but what you
[SPEAKER_03]: generally see at 10 days in the growth
chamber with these backgrounds is the
[SPEAKER_03]: lesions are starting to form, but it's not
totally, sorry, it's a PDF, so it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: totally crusty like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks more similar to this HD2 here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much spatial variation do you think
there is in gene expression?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, con.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sampling for this experiment was
done by Santiago Medeiros mostly from our
[SPEAKER_03]: lab before he moved on to post-doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've been sending another one
with QTL isolines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tossed around a lot of different ideas
to basically minimize sample variance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that experiment, what I ultimately
settled on was basically taking a big
[SPEAKER_03]: swath the same size as what we were
sampling for histopathology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're averaging out a fair amount of
area around where the lesion's incipient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, so we inoculate the whorls,
and so you get most of our spores in a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty obvious band.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, most of the infection in the
growth chamber when we were inoculated is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening within about two inches.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think mine is related to this string of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my impression is that in a lot of
these hemibiotropic interactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: the biotropic phase is only like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this such a different kind of
interaction than any other hemibiotropic
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so the majority is on wheat
pathogens and magnetoporthane rice,
[SPEAKER_03]: like of what we had to compare this to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as well, so we've also been,
our collaborative team on CURDi works on
[SPEAKER_03]: southern leaf flight, which is called a
hemibiotrope.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that biotropic phase lasts like 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then there's a question of is it
quiescent?
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, this is fairly similar to
what's been observed in magnetoporthane.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other is just pretty rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a good answer for in terms of
how it behaves relative to the wheat
[SPEAKER_03]: hemibiotropes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to indicate one last
question.
Tina.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with regards to the CNN, have you been
able to test its accuracy across the
[SPEAKER_01]: northern leaf flights?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one thing that we.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was, have we been able to
test the accuracy with regards to
[SPEAKER_03]: different leaf flights?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one thing we really wanted to
do at the outset of the grant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and just basically we're not able to do
because there's so many complications from
[SPEAKER_03]: the earlier steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I mean, northern leaf flight
and Thracnus leaf flight, they look really
[SPEAKER_03]: similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, when you've seen them a lot,
you can be like, OK, I can tell some
[SPEAKER_03]: diagnostic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they look really, really similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, yeah, that's the obvious next
question to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please join me in giving a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
