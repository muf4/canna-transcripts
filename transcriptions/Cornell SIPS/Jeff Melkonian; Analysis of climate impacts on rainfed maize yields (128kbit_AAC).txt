[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell University
So yeah, so it's a pretty broad topic and
[SPEAKER_00]: We're I'm going to present a piece of it
that we've been working on and by we I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean there's been a group of us and it
really is a group effort and that's myself
[SPEAKER_00]: Liz Carter Susan Rhea and Steve Shaw with
input from Peter Woodbury and I should say
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are several groups around the
world that are that are really Doing great
[SPEAKER_00]: work in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a seminar a couple weeks ago from a
person from Australia Scott Chapman who is
[SPEAKER_00]: it with CSIRO and he's Associated with a
group at University of Queensland that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing great work on on Trying to
help agricultural producers in Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with impacts of climate and that's
important there and so So why maize why
[SPEAKER_00]: climate impacts and how do we get involved
so the kind of global Answer to the first
[SPEAKER_00]: question is maize is a big crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the leading cereal crop in the world
Demand supposed to increase by 50% over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 50 year or 75 years and Over that
time temperatures are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing by at least two or three
degrees C potentially So that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the overarching reason And why climate
impacts because we're expecting these
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in temperature and and we don't
Potentially changes in precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a number of papers over the
past ten years Primarily from folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: are not their primary area is not
agriculture Where they have done yield
[SPEAKER_00]: projections using statistical modeling and
they have really they've suggested pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: severe impacts of Increasing temperatures
on maize productivity both historically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in particular into the future
several years ago Susan and Steve kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: looked into this and and had some
questions about the methodologies and
[SPEAKER_00]: results and that led to a paper where they
did some initial work on looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigated maize production to see whether
they could detect a temperature impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: on irrigated maize and they were Unable to
in the in the data they looked at but that
[SPEAKER_00]: led to a hatchback Hatch proposal that
that was funded and allowed us to look
[SPEAKER_00]: more You know intensively at at the impact
of climate on maize With particular
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis on temperature, but it kind of
evolved into additional in additional
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts So I'm just gonna try to go
through some of the kind of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on maize maize yields so so the
cap on yields Is solar radiation and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have that here But that any given
location for any given soil is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: solar radiation But the next most
important impact despite all the emphasis
[SPEAKER_00]: on temperature actually is precipitation I
think every most agronomists and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologists would agree that that's the
main limitation Climate limitation on on
[SPEAKER_00]: maize production So I got this quote from
Tom Sinclair the thousand-pound gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: and crop response to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's referring to precipitation that's
partly because Maybe to emphasize that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's it's precipitation more than
the more recent emphasis on temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the fact that we don't
Projections of precipitation are really
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really don't know what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have a major impact But
there are direct temperature impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: maize and probably the most well
Documented is on phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means higher temperatures accelerated
rated development reduced cumulative
[SPEAKER_00]: Intercepted radiation in lower yields and
that's been that's been pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also are physiological impacts
Reduced pollen viability loss of membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity inactivation of some
heat-sensitive enzymes particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and in starch synthesis and
Increased respiration but those you know
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 38 to 40 degrees C And keep that in
mind because we'll be getting coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that in a bit There are what have been
proposed these indirect temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts and primarily that's that there's
going to be an increase in evaporative
[SPEAKER_00]: demand It's going to cause more frequent
Bouts of water stress in maize and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: yields I'm going to actually spend a fair
amount of time on that and I'll get like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to that in a bit There are
complications and that's these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions for a climate you interact
the problem is is that High temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: drought higher high evaporative demand are
all highly correlated They often a at
[SPEAKER_00]: least in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn Belt there they occur all at the same
time so it becomes very difficult then to
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate which are the factors that are
most responsible for impacts on yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that Liz has been
wrestling with quite A bit recently the
[SPEAKER_00]: second thing and I'm not going to really
talk about this, but it's I think pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: important is There's not really clear
information on when maize is under water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress How will higher temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Impact yield in other words is what kind
of interaction is there when the crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: already in stress from one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe say drought how will then?
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated temperatures in having what
additional impact will they have and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's It's something that there's not a
lot of literature on and the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is not real clear on that But
it's important because it'll it'll it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give information on what are the impacts
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thresholds for damage from say
temperature or or water stress So just to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of do a very simple very brief kind
of overview Of my sense of the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: on the more recent literature that I
mentioned on statistical modeling is there
[SPEAKER_00]: was first an early focus on temperature
and this was to the in precipitation or
[SPEAKER_00]: drought was considered secondary in this
in these studies and they reported pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impacts both historically and
in Projected into the future as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, but note the thresholds that
they were using to where they expected
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to occur reduce yields was Around
30 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in contrast to the to what we saw
before for the physiological damage More
[SPEAKER_00]: recently they I think as they become
became associated with more agriculturally
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented people let's say They shifted
their emphasis to that the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: higher temperatures Climate change was
going to be by increasing evaporative
[SPEAKER_00]: demand as I mentioned before and this this
is something where again, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: projecting pretty Significant impacts and
this is I'm going to try to get to this
[SPEAKER_00]: and explain it a little bit better And I
hope I'll be able to do that Because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have some serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some questions about that Also in
these more recent kind of statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: studies They've understood that there's
acclimation that occurs in maize to high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that could modify or mitigate
the impact of temperature There's also one
[SPEAKER_00]: has to account for genetics management and
soil factors And that there are impacts by
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stage these genetic management soil
factors are really important because they
[SPEAKER_00]: not only impact yield independently of
climate, but they interact with climate to
[SPEAKER_00]: to To affect maize yields and another
quote from Sinclair, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite good is right here temperature
increase Imposed on current crop systems
[SPEAKER_00]: without management or genetic changes is
often predicted to decrease yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is highly likely that cropping
systems remain static, and I think I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to show some It's often predicted,
but it's highly Well He was saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll remain static the deals won't be
affected The temperature they're
[SPEAKER_00]: projecting decrease actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up here Because
actually we can I think we can show at
[SPEAKER_00]: least in some of our data that maize
Management can actually increase yields
[SPEAKER_00]: even with increases in temperature So
these are I'm just going to go through a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of questions and to try to address
this and The climate impacts and in this
[SPEAKER_00]: one on the VPDs I just wanted to say right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two aspects to this impact of a
VPD on on on maize yields or Increase
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporative demand one is whether there
actually will be an increase into the
[SPEAKER_00]: future in the US corn belt and the second
is how if there is what is the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between VPD and the processes of interest
that would be evapotranspiration and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon assimilation and maize,
so I'm going to try to Get to that and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully it will be a little clear so
this first question we address by Using
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical modeling of both irrigated and
rain-fed maize Yields and I'll get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's work that Liz has been Primarily
involved with and in fact gave a seminar
[SPEAKER_00]: last spring on the irrigated component of
that So the advantage we had here is we
[SPEAKER_00]: had access to a data set from the National
Corn Growers Association for both
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigated and rain-fed Categories or
classes This was from 2005 to 2012 It was
[SPEAKER_00]: focused mainly in the western corn belt,
but in the rain-fed we included Iowa also
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other additional states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't started the analyses on those
this is under So the advantage is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal management so the limitations on
yield are going to be due to whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: local factors like soil Might be but other
than that it's going to be a climate
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, and that's what we were really
trying to Get at was what is the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate there are a large number of values
Yield data that we had and then we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: real nice thing is we had all this
additional information So this is both
[SPEAKER_00]: management and genetics information that
was really quite useful and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the impacts on on maize yields
both in the irrigated And in the rain-fed
[SPEAKER_00]: data sets and those were used to define
growth stages that were used that we used
[SPEAKER_00]: to Both look at seasonal impacts,
but also impacts by growth stage again Liz
[SPEAKER_00]: gave Gave a seminar on the irrigated part
of this Work and the the main findings
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that there was evidence for
acclimation There was no impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature with Even in 2012 when we had
near record or record temperatures across
[SPEAKER_00]: the the US corn belt There was also
evidence that By agronomically realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments of management you could
actually increase yields, so there was
[SPEAKER_00]: room for for actually improved yields in
the irrigated Maze in in in the corn belt
[SPEAKER_00]: so so I'm not going to So that's all I'm
going to talk about for the irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: again because that was been presented and
actually that Work has been submitted and
[SPEAKER_00]: for public for publications under review
right now so this is Kind of a summary of
[SPEAKER_00]: the precipitation and grain yields over
time for for the rain-fed any and Just for
[SPEAKER_00]: to contrast I have the irrigated here,
so the main thing to note with the
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation is You know pretty steady,
but 2012 was a very very low precip year
[SPEAKER_00]: By mid-june or so precip shut down,
and there was very little after that
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in in in the western corn
belt This was associated with very high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and very high VPDs I'll
explain a bit more about that No impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: the irrigated yields is like I just
mentioned in fact 2012 was the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: yield highest yielding year Of the period
that we looked at in this period included
[SPEAKER_00]: I should I didn't show the temperature
data But this period included quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad range of temperatures so both higher
and lower The rain-fed yields are here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you'll note I think anybody who's aware
kind of a somewhat aware of grain yields
[SPEAKER_00]: will note that They're pretty high So you
get it's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a yield contest so these growers
are selecting their best sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: so even where There may be it's you know
Precipitation it may be getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of the of the of the kind of rain-fed
production agriculture They're still
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting very very their their best
sites, so There's going to it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe shift The yields a little bit higher
than what they would be normally but in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 there was a reduction in this
reduction the percentage reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: yields in these yield contest data is
pretty much the same as what the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in yields were in the Midwest in
2012 reported in the national agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics, so Even though the absolute
values are higher the magnitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction 2012 was was about the same and
I'm going to focus on 2012 because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: the climate extremes have that occurred in
that year So this is kind of some summary
[SPEAKER_00]: data and most of what I'm going to show is
descriptive because we're still in the
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary part of Of this and these
analyses the top panel is grain yield as a
[SPEAKER_00]: function of vapor pressure deficit This is
for rain fed for Kansas, Missouri,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Nebraska so you note that There is
does appear to be a relationship where
[SPEAKER_00]: whereby at higher VPDs you do get lower
yields Important to keep in mind though
[SPEAKER_00]: that the there's a there's correlations
among the climate variables here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll get to that So you know it's not
a maybe so much of a surprise that the
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical modeling that's been done
might show that VPD is a Factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting maize yields, but I think what
we'll try to show is that it's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated than that We look at Iowa I
was interesting the rain fed data Same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing grain field as a function of vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really no no impact partly
because the climate was not as severely
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted in 2012 as it was in in In the
Western Corn Belt, so we never got the
[SPEAKER_00]: really high VPDs low pre as low precip and
as high temperatures This is the irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: as a as a comparison Shows that when you
eliminate water stress There's no impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of vapor pressure deficit or high
temperature on yields So getting to this
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation that I've been mentioning so
this is this is the kind of Combined data
[SPEAKER_00]: from for all the the yield data for the
rain fed from 2005 to 2012 showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: season average T max as a function of
season average vapor Pressure deficit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see clearly there's a relationship
higher the temperature the higher the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit There's a color
code here for precip for June July and
[SPEAKER_00]: August total precip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll note that The higher precepts are
in at the lower VPDs lower temperatures as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to these higher values You could
that's where the lower precipitation is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring so again important to keep you
know this Is important to note so it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it more difficult to identify these
drivers This is another way of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: where we plotted grain yield as a function
of growing season precipitation Where we
[SPEAKER_00]: color-coded for vapor pressure deficit
here so darker colors are higher vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficits So you note up into
about down to about 300 millimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: June July August precept Yields are
scattered, but they're not but they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly high what about 300 and lower you
get quite a range of yields and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some very low yields These are in
particular where the very highest vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficits are were recorded This
was interesting these were interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: data because of the large range and I'll
try to explain why You might at least what
[SPEAKER_00]: we is one factor that might be responsible
for why you're getting very high yields
[SPEAKER_00]: But also very low yields here,
but again Just pointing out this
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation among these climate factors
that are important in determining Mays
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity So I Didn't I was going to
present some data initial data on them
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistical modeling that Liz has done,
but I decided not to because I felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: it I Wasn't confident enough of my
knowledge of that modeling to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did want to present one thing one
first to note that In the modeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: she's done so far all the climate factors
were significant so VPD precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and the temperature thresholds
that we looked at the indices that we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at all came out to be having
significant impact on on Mays yields the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest impact though interestingly enough
was planting rate and My interpretation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is that What what it appeared to be
is that in the yield contest the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: were Were actually too conservative in
their planting rate what we found when we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the rain fed data for the four
states we looked at is that And under all
[SPEAKER_00]: Scenarios are there all vapor pressure
deficits you did better by increasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: planting rate, so you've got higher yields
no matter whether it was No matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: DPD I think again this comes back to the
fact that these these con and these
[SPEAKER_00]: contests are paid for Picking their best
sites so these sites are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum water holding capacity soil water
holding capacity, and I think they for
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 in that year they were just able to
Add enough stored soil water to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good yield that's my kind of
interpretation, but we're still analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: these data, but again note that even at
very high planting rates You know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you got your maximum yield at all
vapor pressure deficits I should say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we're focused on rain fed Mays
here and in humid production humid region
[SPEAKER_00]: production This is not dry land production
dry land production the recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: for planting rate are much lower than than
what we're showing here in part that's to
[SPEAKER_00]: for I think to for the for the because
growers tend to be risk-averse,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the the the seed companies are
predicting or not predicting but
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing lower planting rates in part
because they don't want to have the Onus
[SPEAKER_00]: of having a total crop failure,
but that's not what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about rain fed humid region
production here So a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that that that Liz she's settling
on their appropriate methodology for
[SPEAKER_00]: variable selection and coefficient
estimation or modeling to Statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling the problem that she's had is a
correlation that I just mentioned on the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate variables But also that there's a
spatial correlation between management and
[SPEAKER_00]: climate variables, and that's Liz is I
think getting to a point where we're close
[SPEAKER_00]: right It's been a long process,
but she's done an excellent job on it So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll move on to the second question which
is this gets back to the VPDs Is there
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence to support this assumption of
higher VPDs in the Corn Belt under climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really out of my out of my waters
here, but this is what I'm understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: is is occurring Precipitation most of the
precipitation for the US Corn Belt Comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from systems coming out of the Gulf of
Mexico They come up the Mississippi
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley, and they they and produce rainfall
When that doesn't there are occasions
[SPEAKER_00]: though where you get these episodic
droughts this occurs when a high-pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: system embeds in the Midwest it blocks the
transport of precipitation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems up from the Gulf of Mexico and and
This has occurred in 1983 1988 and then as
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking quite a bit about in
2012 The sequence of events is important
[SPEAKER_00]: here because what it what as far as I
understand from the literature The main
[SPEAKER_00]: instigators reduce precipitation So
there's less rainfall This reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: regional evapotranspiration That means
that more of the incoming solar radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting partitioned to sensible heat
which atmospheric heating let's say higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and These higher temperatures
lead to the higher vapor pressure deficits
[SPEAKER_00]: So the real instigator is not that there
are going to be higher vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficits as a blanket You know as a
blanket statement for all future climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to be during These
episodic droughts and the instigator is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be reduced precipitation It is
unclear whether these episodic droughts
[SPEAKER_00]: Events where you have these high-pressure
systems embedding in there in the region
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it'll be more or less likely to
occur with climate change, but I did think
[SPEAKER_00]: it was interesting that One of the
candidates for the geospatial position
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan Mueller From in his work the
prediction was that This they will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequent that in fact, it's there's
likely to be higher precipitations
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation Total precipitation during
the growing season in the in the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that they're still on some uncertainty
about that So with respect to whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be higher BPDs, I think Based on
this I would say it's not if they're out
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are higher They're not going to be
significantly higher and the only time
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get them is during these episodic
droughts So then they'll move on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the third question is Can we what
can we say about the impact of climate on
[SPEAKER_00]: key processes in Mays and for this I'm
going to Move more into To a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: in depth on the impact on on on the crop
in a particular focus on the diurnal
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics of evapotranspiration in
particular Not so much on carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we did that but look at diurnal
dynamics at the field level of Those
[SPEAKER_00]: processes in relation to temperature and
vapor pressure deficits or evaporative
[SPEAKER_00]: demand So the way I'm going to do that is
by by talking about work that we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: using flux tower data and Anticovariance
methodology to look at fluxes of so latent
[SPEAKER_00]: heat flux or evaporative inspiration and
sensible heat fluxes in other words
[SPEAKER_00]: heating And then in with additional data
look at some some other things including
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in canopy temperature Changes in
aerodynamic conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't talk about that, but that's one of
the key factors that is is Involved but
[SPEAKER_00]: then in particular focus on canopy
conductance As a function of these climate
[SPEAKER_00]: variables diurnally and at the field level
we mainly focused on AmeriFlex towers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mead, Nebraska And we looked at the
irrigated Mays towers and I'll explain a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit why we did that We also had a
tower in Aurora ourselves in Aurora last
[SPEAKER_00]: year Which actually produced quite good
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be getting to those data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have time So I'll focus
mostly on the Mead data So This is
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully going to help set up a little
bit of what I'm what I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about When we're talking about these
fluxes Latent heat and sensible heat
[SPEAKER_00]: fluxes the amount of energy coming into a
field To the surface of the canopy is the
[SPEAKER_00]: the described here is the incoming solar
minus reflected rate solar radiation Plus
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between long wave in long
wave out work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling that the net radiation So
that's total energy coming into the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy That energy has to be
dissipated somehow in order to balance the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can either be lost as evapotransmitter
Transpiration or it can be lost as
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible heat sensible heat just means You
have an object at a higher temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lower temperature and it's the energy
transfer from the higher temperature to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower temperature When we're talking
about a crop it's almost always during
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight hours Means the temperature of
the canopy is higher and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring energy from that canopy to a
lower temperature atmosphere So The way
[SPEAKER_00]: you can think of how the crop impacts us
so there so so there are two factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: affect how this energy is partitioned
between Evapotranspiration and sensible
[SPEAKER_00]: heat loss one is VPD So that will affect
it higher VPDs will shift it more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration and less towards
sensible heat loss But the plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: control over that through crop conductance
So it so at higher crop conductances You
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same effect a shift towards more
Evapotranspiration under any given set of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions at lower crop conductance
conductances in other words like
[SPEAKER_00]: underwater stress you shift the energy is
shifted more towards sensible heat loss in
[SPEAKER_00]: other words the canopy heats up So I hope
that that helps a little bit when I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next few slides, but another thing
to note is that globally about 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: net radiation is dissipated through
evapotranspiration So that when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about increases in temperature
increases in evaporative demand There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: limit set by the amount of incoming energy
as to how much can be shifted how much
[SPEAKER_00]: more Evapotranspiration can occur if you
look at this example If we're at we're
[SPEAKER_00]: averaging around 6 millimeters per day of
evapotranspiration Where 80% and that
[SPEAKER_00]: represents 80% of the total net radiation
the most you can get most Increase in that
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get is about to 7.5
millimeters per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a real limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you it's not like You know,
you can you you just are capped by the
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important thing to keep in
mind So here's some kind of just to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at some of the dying diurnal dynamics in
kind of broad terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are data from from one of the
AmeriFlux towers at Mead just showing a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical kind of diurnal sequence of of of
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of orange bars the incoming net
radiation the green is evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_00]: or latent heat and The red is sensible
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for a well-watered Canopy so you
can see that most of the incoming net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation is accounted for in by
evapotranspiration and very little by
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible heat transfer One thing to note
is that the blue dashed line is a vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit So the key thing to note
is that the highest vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficits are actually occurring later in
the day When net radiation is low,
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what this is a kind of a
typical water stress canopy then same
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming net radiation But because we're
beginning to get stomatal closure or
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction crop conductance the shift in
partitioning of that energy is now more to
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible heat and less to latent heat or
less to evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the what's the impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact is that we look at air
temperature versus canopy temperature for
[SPEAKER_00]: that water stress example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now getting canopy temperatures that
are significantly above air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll explain more about that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are data from the Mead towers for
irrigated maize for 2010, 11, and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might wonder why we're using
irrigated data here when we're I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about rain in part on about rain fed
maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happened fortuitously for us,
but maybe not for them so much that in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 they basically weren't able to keep
up with the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually had essentially a deficit
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting water stress in their
crop and so that actually turned out
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely because we were not able to get
rain fed data from those towers in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't they were in a soybean maize
rotation and that year they happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in soybean for the for the rain fed
towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to note is you know
what we what we see here is vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficits over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for the for the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from canopy closure to the
beginning of senescence so it's time when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a full canopy but no senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the compiled data over that time
for the different hours here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vapor pressure deficits remain
fairly low during the two years where
[SPEAKER_00]: there was good irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were not and they were not drought
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: During 2012 like we've been talking about
the vapor pressure deficits increased
[SPEAKER_00]: considerably and again that had we saw
that earlier in some of the data that we
[SPEAKER_00]: showed from for the yield contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is interesting because this shows
latent heat evapotranspiration as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of net radiation over time for
these for the same three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind net radiation is
approximately equal to latent heat per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour plus sensible heat or
evapotranspiration plus sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see through most of the day
we're at about 0.8 so that's about as I
[SPEAKER_00]: was pointing out before globally about 80%
of the net radiation is accounted for by
[SPEAKER_00]: by evapotranspiration and that's pretty
and we're so this is pretty consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: with us and that occurred in all three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But note later in the day this is when the
VPDs are increasing we do see an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in all three years in the fraction of net
radiation that's accounted for by
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration and it goes up again in
all three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was interesting is that is 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2012 it actually went above the
ratio went above one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that happens because the canopy is
actually being cooled to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: there is now the sensible heat flux is
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually getting heat transfer or
energy transfer from the atmosphere to the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is from a kind of a
production standpoint with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: these drought periods is this a good
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing water here and it's occurring
at a time when net radiation is going
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that much photosynthesis,
crop photosynthesis is actually declined
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty steeply then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we were able to stop this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we conserve water in these drought
years and potentially get a higher yield
[SPEAKER_00]: under those conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back to that but that's
something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows the crop conductance and it
shows that so this is a typical pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see for well watered crops crop
conductance over the period of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2010, 2011, 2012 was lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time crop canopy closure occurred
in these fields the drought was already in
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not keeping up with the
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're already seeing evidence of that
by lower crop conductances in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though conductance is going down
you'd think would then reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very high VPDs that we saw earlier
here were high enough to counteract that
[SPEAKER_00]: and create you know actually result in
this where we were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration at such a high rate
that we were actually getting canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and this shows what the kind of net
result of that is is that instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that instead of that canopy being
much higher than air temperature than the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that we see in the irrigated
years it actually was being maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close to those and really not in a
range where we'd expect any temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this a good thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might argue that it's better to keep
temperatures it's better to lose a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of water and keep those temperatures
canopy temperatures a little cooler if
[SPEAKER_00]: your main concern is temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main concern is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might go the other way and say well
let's have some more stomata closure and
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll sacrifice a little higher
temperatures but we'll save some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows just kind of a kind of a
summary graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at evapotranspiration in
millimeters per hour as a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color codes the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have blue for 2010, green for 2011,
and red for 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing to note here and this gets
back to how much total evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_00]: can occur when you're capped by the amount
of energy limited by the amount of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that at about 2 kPa vapor
pressure deficit basically you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: transpire any more water that's kind of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the impact of lower
conductance in 2012 in that at any given
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD we're getting higher evaporate ET
rates in 2010 and 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see at the higher highest VPDs
we are that those are occurring in 2012
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're seeing those out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a scatter of points here and
I'll show this in a bit but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: because net radiation is going down at the
time the highest VPDs are occurring and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually getting even though you're
at a maximum or above that you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration as a fraction of net
radiation is actually above one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total amount of water loss is actually
not that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll get to the last question which
is this issue of what do you want to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of trying to improve crops,
improve maize hybrids for these episodic
[SPEAKER_00]: droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Pioneer has opted to do in their
breeding is to come out with so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those drought tolerant varieties one
of the it's clear that one of the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been introduced is the that they
have made them sensitive to vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So above a certain vapor pressure deficit
the stomata begin to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you're conserving water
during those drought years so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough water to get a decent yield at
the end of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are so I'm calling these kind of
reduced transpiration hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've opted for the water
conservation and not for any impact that
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be on as a result of that on
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows some some modeling results
to that were from a paper in Journal of
[SPEAKER_00]: Experimental Botany by the Pioneer folks
primarily to try to demonstrate what the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of this trait might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their drought tolerant,
drought sensitive is the dash looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in soil moisture over the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that early on with this
trait of reduced transpiration trait there
[SPEAKER_00]: was less water extracted from the profile
and more water towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season and the drought tolerant
cool drought tolerant variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they looked at total biomass and
yield with this in this modeling exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that up to a certain point they
were both the same but then late in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season because the more available water
deeper in the pro in the soil profile with
[SPEAKER_00]: a drought talk that fry was able to use
that water and produce more yield and more
[SPEAKER_00]: total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did just to kind of take a
quick look at this was we did a modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise where we looked at York Kansas in
2012 a very again very hot very dry
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at two scenarios one was
where we had crop conductance independent
[SPEAKER_00]: of vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one where we allowed it to be
dependent on vapor pressure deficit based
[SPEAKER_00]: on data from a paper that was used as one
of the kind of foundations for this
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing this trait into these drought
tolerant varieties or sensitive reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is the total amount of
ET that occurred when it was independent
[SPEAKER_00]: was 217 millimeters over this month versus
182 millimeters when you had made this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop conductance dependent on VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does save water at least based on
our work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at evapotranspiration hourly
as a function of vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of we saw this just just on a
few slides previously showing a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cap around 2 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is the blue are before
3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: the red are 1 to 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and the green are after 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just illustrates that even though
the VPDs were very high later the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of water loss was not as high as
earlier because the net radiation was
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the independent where crop
conductance is independent of vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's dependent we actually cap this
at a lower ET rate so at around 7
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters that's 0.7 millimeters per
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get the we get the savings of water
and that's a that's a good thing if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a drought situation and you want to
have you're willing to sacrifice maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit yield in the really good years
but you're going to get more yield in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drier drier years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is here is is temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this scenario we had air temperature
we looked at canopy temperature with no
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD dependence and canopy canopy
temperature where there was a dependence
[SPEAKER_00]: of crop conductance on VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little screwed up here but the the
air temperature over that period the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum air temperature was around 37 C no
VPD dependence the canopy temperature was
[SPEAKER_00]: around 38 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you had it made a VPD dependent you
were saving water the result was you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is what do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you you have this trade you'll save
water but you're going to get higher
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy canopy temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start getting canopy
temperatures presumably into the into the
[SPEAKER_00]: yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep well I what they did when they they
they they they looked at a large range of
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes and this and this initial work
that was done on this and they just did it
[SPEAKER_00]: was growth chamber work and looked at
imposing different vapor pressure deficits
[SPEAKER_00]: and at what point did they begin to get a
shift in in transpiration indicating a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity of stomata to vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of genotypes didn't show that
response but there were some that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of apparently was the
foundation for moving to to trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: include this trade into the into the
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you know you can save water but
you but you potentially are pushing canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: A paper just recently came out in Crop
Science where this they you know there was
[SPEAKER_00]: some recognition of the problem with this
and so what they've tried to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: they think they have identified are
hybrids that are sensitive to VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they shut down or they reduce
transpiration at higher VPDs but at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain temperature they lose that and
they begin to open up and so they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool at around and this seems to be
around 38 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean now that needs to be looked into
because what I've tried to point out is
[SPEAKER_00]: these high VPDs coincide with droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stomata are already responding to a
soil moisture stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much more this trait you
know this this this how this might
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with what we know is already
going on but that's that was interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that there began to be recognition that
this could be a potentially serious issue
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a very brief and very kind
of cursory overview of what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and we hope to be able to continue this
work particularly extend the statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling to include other regions and also
do more work on our eddy covariance and
[SPEAKER_00]: crop growth modeling looking more into
these interactions between the climate and
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge the group I
mentioned before and these other folks for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the work all the input that they
provided for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular Andy Schweiker at Mead for
the Meriflux data, Paul Stachowski and
[SPEAKER_00]: staff at Musgrave for the flux tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of folks at Pioneer for
information on their cultivars and Tim for
[SPEAKER_00]: some helpful discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our flux tower from last year
at Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a quick question on the drug
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that they don't believe that
they're obligated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think again we are looking at the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find quite low yields in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like here say we don't get you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I look at that graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well so do you increase the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: The varieties that show this are still
performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response was so great that you were
shutting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're talking about a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is occurring at DPDs that are
well above 2K.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking on the border of 30
millimeters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not imposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not during.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a very significant loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very strong reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well I mean that was water stress
causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show this but what's interesting
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the carbon exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually wasn't all that much impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty similar in all three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact the yields that they got in
all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it showed this response in
2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big push deficit at different climbing
densities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean just to say that it was
counterintuitive to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if you can give it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words it shows that at low
climbing density.
[SPEAKER_03]: The yield suffers more as DPD goes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're looking at is the
quality of the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in these sites there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice the yields are quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're talking about really good
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually these rates were too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were losing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were not getting enough
plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the optimum density for that for those
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could put more plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were below the optimum for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't think that would be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any given DPD yields go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any given planting density yields go
down as you increase DPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well not much at 100,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: No not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it only depends on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's again my interpretation of
that is that these are yield contested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this correlation or relationship
is driven by non-independence between
[SPEAKER_02]: planting density and the location.
[SPEAKER_02]: People with really good soils they plant
at really high density.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you also say that at low planting
densities if the plants are not under DPD
[SPEAKER_08]: stress they can kind of compensate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if they are under DPD stress they
can't compensate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been safe for the low density.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually we're looking at the whole idea
issue of lower planting densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water you actually save by doing
your test.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
