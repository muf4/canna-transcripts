[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you for the great
welcome and the great turnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really an honor for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Susan mentioned that I work for a company
called Indigo Ag, which is into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We develop endophytes for the benefit of
crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do partnerships with growers and
risk mitigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We characterize crops that are grown and
segregate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to market that through identity
preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mention that because my job with Indigo
is I head up university relationships and
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly in my job is to focus on
those campuses that are of strategic
[SPEAKER_01]: interest and importance to Indigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cornell is one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell, I'd say Texas A&M is another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot with K-State.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our work is in wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's only really a handful of
campuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were a delegation from Indigo was
here last August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had one-on-one visits with folks
like Dr. McCooch and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not just interested in
microbiology or the plant microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of our interest in segregation and
trying to market and capture greater value
[SPEAKER_01]: out of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop quality, utilization, food safety,
food performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those aspects are important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my third trip to Ithaca since last
August.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here many, many times before
through the biofuels work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for such nice weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came here from Brookings, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still live in Brookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to Boston two or three times a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my wife's going to have 35 below
temperatures tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not wind chill factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have 50 below zero wind chill
back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I've done at South
Dakota State, just like any other
[SPEAKER_01]: institution I imagine, there's some very
interesting historical figures that have
[SPEAKER_01]: had an impact on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have our share of those at South
Dakota State as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll really do a deep dive on one of
them here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Edgar McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple others as well that I
might make mention of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, these stories interweave
with other places, including New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to point out as I get going and
developing this story that I've become
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I wake up at night with a
new idea on where to search.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to Rockefeller Foundation
archives, the National Archives,
[SPEAKER_01]: many university archives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had a partner in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's in the room, Cindy Bartel.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't know I was going to introduce
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cindy's a postdoc here at Cornell in
the Atkinson Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before she went to grad school,
I was able to wrangle her into helping me
[SPEAKER_01]: out with some of these searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Cindy, because a big part
of this was because of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's just been wonderful to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into this story and who was
Edgar McFadden and what type of
[SPEAKER_01]: advancement and contributions did he,
I had the word contributions, what were
[SPEAKER_01]: his contributions to wheat improvement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least where I'm going to pick up
on the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story begins before this, but I'm
going to pick up on this story in Lisbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up in St. Lawrence County,
just south of the St. Lawrence River.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first community established in
that county and that part of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 1801 or something like that
that the town of Lisbon was created.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think it was named after Lisbon,
Portugal, but it's actually Lisborne,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Lisburn, Ireland that it's named after,
just right outside in Northern Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an Irish community in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: James McFadden was born in 1856 there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisbon is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a population of about 4,000
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a college graduate of Potsdam
Teachers College in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he got his degree and started a career
in teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: After he got his degree, he left New York
and moved to central Minnesota to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: his teaching career.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met a young lady there, that was eight
years younger than he was, and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatrice, they pronounce it Beatrice,
her name was Beatrice Stocky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, they were married and they
moved and left Minnesota and homesteaded
[SPEAKER_01]: in Dakota territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota was not a state yet,
but in the mid 1800s, they left Minnesota
[SPEAKER_01]: to homestead in Day County, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had three children.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Lily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lily was the oldest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar was the middle child, Edgar Sharp
McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really the tail end child because
the brother Clarence died in infancy about
[SPEAKER_01]: 81, which is not an unusual occurrence in
that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where Day County, they live just
right outside of Webster, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna get down to about 40 degrees
below zero there tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the environment that they were
living in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, winters were hard 100
years ago there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the family underwent just tragic hard
times for one reason or another,
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning in 1899.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clarence died in infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't know what he died of,
but it wasn't an uncommon thing for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to die as youngsters at that period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a tragedy to the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, they were farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were trying to make a living off of
160 acres of land in that part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a couple of milk cows and they
had some chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Edgar and his dad would sell milk
and cream and egg deliveries into the town
[SPEAKER_01]: of Webster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lived six miles out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would be involved in that with those
dairy deliveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he learned the value of hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, it was hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Edgar was a unique individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a key thing to remember in this
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He later wrote that by age 13,
he had read the work of, gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having one of my senior moments there
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Mendelian, he wrote Gregor Mendel's
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't rediscovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, it was rediscovered in Europe in
1900.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by 1904, Edgar said that he had
reviewed and he was studying Mendel's
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had already read Darwin's Origin of
Species by that age as a very young man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the question I've had that I haven't
been able to find out is someone living in
[SPEAKER_01]: Webster, South Dakota, Dade County,
South Dakota, how do you access that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get access to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I have yet to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nevertheless, I believe that he did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm convinced that he did it because by
1904, from his review and study of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendel's work, he was already doing some
of his own selection work out in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: on his own farm in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to develop a beardless line of
wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no odds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was going out into fields and
trying to put to the test this segregation
[SPEAKER_01]: of wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't doing any crosses or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he was already making his own
population, developing his own population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was doing that on his own as a young
man by the time 1904.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1904 comes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And early in that spring, his father was
gored by the family bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a reflection of what it
was like to live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't killed, but he was severely
injured and it impacted him for the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his father was injured in 1904.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1904, they had a severe stem rust
epidemic that reduced their crop by about
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're living in that type of a
situation, just think about the economic
[SPEAKER_01]: impact that has on a family and a
community and the whole region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a huge impact there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar dedicated his life as a young man
trying to do what he could to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what he eventually became and came to know
as a stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science of stem rust, he wanted to
know about wheat and this whole area of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and genetics in wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that intrigued him for the rest of his
entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what followed up after that is he
was getting on his way in science on his
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, he had about an eighth grade
education at this period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1908 comes around in his older sister,
Lily died at age 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his mother was getting sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one tragedy after the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still maintained ownership of the
farm in Dade County, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept that and they rented it out
essentially, but the family picked up and
[SPEAKER_01]: moved all three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually they went to Orange County,
California first to see what they could,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what kind of life they might have
there and spent a few months with some
[SPEAKER_01]: relatives out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately they moved to Ballmeray,
Texas in this part of Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pecos County, 1908, just north of the
Davis Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of see some topography
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Davis Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that period of time, that was the
haunt of banditos out of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks like Pancho Villa were actually
hiding and living and operating in that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of Texas, crossing the Rio Grande
River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would come in that deeply
into Texas, into the Davis Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what Edgar was doing, while they
lived and tried to maintain this small
[SPEAKER_01]: cattle ranch down in Texas, Edgar would
follow the wheat harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bear in mind that there weren't
combines at that period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wheat was harvested manually.
[SPEAKER_01]: With size and it would be shocked up and
then it would be thrashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he would become part of these
harvest crews and follow the wheat harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up into North Dakota every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given his interest, he was paying
attention to stem rust spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: stem rust infections out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the morphological stage of
maturity of wheat as he was going through?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the condition of this wheat?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was taking notes and learning all
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was doing that on his own as a young
man going from Texas up into the Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a photograph of Edgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The family had this Kodak camera and they
took lots of pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those still exist today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a photograph of Edgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be about 1908, 1909,
somewhere in that figure, down in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see he's got a double-barreled
shotgun there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got a six-shooter sticking in his
belt with a belt full of cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, he would call himself a range
rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely he was a genuine cowboy,
Texas cowboy, during this period of his
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Edgar S.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else was going on 100 years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: During this same period of time,
we had a monumental figure in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology and wheat genetics at the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elvin Steakman, and there's testament to
him still on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in Steakman Hall just last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elvin Steakman was recognized as the
world's global expert on poxinium at that
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He established a laboratory for
essentially epidemiology of these diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: in wheat and other small grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also an advocate for barberry
eradication, barberry as an alternate host
[SPEAKER_01]: to poxinium.
[SPEAKER_01]: He believed that that barberry was a
source of infection for wheat crop up and
[SPEAKER_01]: down the Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an important figure here is Elvin
Steakman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, Elvin Steakman was a major
advisor for Norman Borlaug later on in
[SPEAKER_01]: Steakman's career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple other figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I've developed an even longer
talk about, and that's Nils Hansen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nils Hansen was a professor of
horticulture at South Dakota State
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first USDA plant explorer,
hired by Tama James Wilson, Secretary of
[SPEAKER_01]: Ag at the turn of the century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made six expeditions into Russia to
bring back termplasm for USDA's plant
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction system.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it was alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a big bundle of Siberian alfalfa
there under his arm, and that's how he
lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, he's got a little six-shooter there
in his belt as well with a billy club.
[SPEAKER_01]: He liked to pose for pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he brought back a lot of small grains,
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still today, a lot of those introductions
in apples are used today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of horticultural crops, cabbages,
cucurbits, you mentioned it, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: crested wheatgrass, a lot of those things,
smooth brown grass were first introduced
[SPEAKER_01]: by Nils Hansen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mark Carlton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Carlton was also a USDA explorer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hailed out of Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of our small grains introductions
around the turn of the century,
[SPEAKER_01]: durums, red wheats, emers, rye,
oats, barley, those types of things were
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced by Mark Carlton.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of development in wheat in
the northern Great Plains and Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: during this period of time, and we can't
get into all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the most monumental
developments out of Canada, out of Ottawa,
[SPEAKER_01]: was Marquis Wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marquis was developed by the Saunders
brothers out of the experiment station at
[SPEAKER_01]: Ottawa, beginning with a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this is one of the earliest
examples of making a bi-parental cross of
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to develop a new line of,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was hard red spring
wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the development work being done at
states and by companies were selections
[SPEAKER_01]: out of land races or out of farmer-held
populations of small grains or
[SPEAKER_01]: introductions that Mark Carlton or Hansen
might have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kubanka, for example, was a durum wheat
introduced by Hansen, and Kubanka was
[SPEAKER_01]: developed as a durum wheat variety in the
northern Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of that, a selection called Acme Durum
was released by South Dakota State
[SPEAKER_01]: University, but it wasn't a breeding
program per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a selection program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a breeding program that developed
Marquis Wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents were Red Calcutta and Red
Fife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Fife was overwhelmingly the most
popular spring wheat in Canada and the
[SPEAKER_01]: northern Plains, but they made this cross
for an improvement of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was put into production in the early
turn of the century in Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately arrived in the northern Great
Plains in about 1912, but it had poor stem
[SPEAKER_01]: rust resistance, so it was still
susceptible to stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden was following the wheat harvest
northward and observing wheat,
[SPEAKER_01]: making scientific observations of wheat
and stem rust and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He eventually established this theory and
kept in mind that people were very
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about Barbary and trying to
eradicate Barbary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would solve the problem, but Edgar
was of a mind that actually spores were
[SPEAKER_01]: being harbored in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather systems, the spring weather
systems that would come about every
[SPEAKER_01]: spring, some years worse than others,
would start delivering through these low
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would start delivering spores up the
Great Plains to infect the crop as it
[SPEAKER_01]: developed throughout the springtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the fall, when the weather systems
change, like now, but you get these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems that then bring down those spores
and redistribute them back into Texas and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: He eventually in his career, if we can
disrupt this Puxinia pathway or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Puxinia highway as it was called,
that would be another mechanism or another
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to controlling stem rust,
especially in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's Edgar McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started his career later in his career
and his office at College Station,
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it here to just get into a little
side story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the honor just a couple of years ago
of meeting a person that was an
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduate student employee of Edgar's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said when he went to ask for a job of
Edgar in this office, sitting on a chair,
[SPEAKER_01]: he went to go see Edgar and Edgar was on
that phone right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said, come on in, sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Edgar sitting down or Jim Fabian,
the guy I talked to, sitting down and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking at this photograph on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you the photograph, but it's a
very intriguing photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a photograph of some bandidos and
Edgar's father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar was noticing this guy studying the
photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: The man on the right-hand side standing is
James McFadden, Edgar's father,
[SPEAKER_01]: down in Texas and there in the Davis
Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The man in the dark coat on the horse is
Pancho Villa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They encountered Pancho Villa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story is from Edgar through Jim Fabian
to me, is that here Edgar is, think about
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar took this picture and he's sitting
somewhere back here with a guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that they were out looking in
this part of the area is the guide,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mexican guide, Edgar's father and
Edgar were looking for a new pasture to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn their cattle into.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were looking for grazing land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They met up with these bandidos and Edgar,
as a young man, takes a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So click.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bandido that's back here where
Edgar was, where the camera is,
[SPEAKER_01]: a revolver comes out and it's pointed
right at Edgar's chest and holy hell
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were upset that someone took a
picture of Pancho Villa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guide that was with them stepped in
the way of the aim and calmed down the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one was shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar McFadden was not shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine yourself in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've been held at gunpoint in other
countries and I can tell you, it gets your
[SPEAKER_01]: attention and you think about it and you
have a hard time getting to sleep and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that would have Edgar as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the very next photograph in that roll
is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guide that they were with,
the interpreter did a really great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you got these guys that are mugging
the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the mountains in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy looks like the meanest one right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the bandolieros of ammunition and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the encounter that he had and
I'm convinced that that was a turning
[SPEAKER_01]: point in Edgar's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after that event and Edgar went
back on the harvest, the wheat harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: followed it back up to the northern part
of the United States back in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he got to South Dakota, he wrote back
and he said, I'm just not going back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this was the pivotal moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to do something else with his
life, something else as a career.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to make an impact and doing that
down in Texas wasn't going on getting
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went back to the family farm,
they still own, moved back to Webster,
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota and his parents followed him
back to South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the family still to this day still
owns that land down by Ballmeray,
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how you can run many cattle
out there, but nevertheless, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: brought him back to South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1911, Edgar went to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear in mind he had an eighth grade
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can't enter into college and so many of
the land grant institutions like Minnesota
[SPEAKER_01]: and North Dakota, elsewhere, they had an
affiliated school called an Aggie school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a boarding school and it was
put there as part of the initial land
[SPEAKER_01]: grant mission to provide opportunity
because communities like Webster,
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota didn't have high schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't going to further their
education in those communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar entered into the Aggie school or
his official name was the South Dakota
[SPEAKER_01]: School of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it was right across the street,
it was on the campus of South Dakota State
[SPEAKER_01]: College, he got to meet a lot of the
scientists including Manley Champlin who
[SPEAKER_01]: was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manley was an agronomist and an initial
breeder at South Dakota State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manley was one of those people and I think
all of you in this room have those people
[SPEAKER_01]: that take you under their wing,
they're your mentor and they further your
[SPEAKER_01]: career and Manley Champlin was that person
for Edgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Manley hired Edgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew that he had a winner because he
was self-driven, he was inquisitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: he understood the science and he wanted to
learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was busy with small grains research
throughout South Dakota, working not just
[SPEAKER_01]: on wheat but barley and other crops and
actually Edgar, as a young man in
[SPEAKER_01]: Champlin, they released, I mentioned Acne
as a selection out of Kubanka,
[SPEAKER_01]: Durham wheat, they released that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar, ever interested in stem rust,
he was reading the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took note, I've seen this note,
so he really took a note that Mark Carlton
[SPEAKER_01]: had observed that Durham and Emmer,
so distant relatives of hexaploid wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: were resistant to stem rust and leaf rust
and suggested that they might be used as a
[SPEAKER_01]: germ plasm source in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, the year later, John Cole at
South Dakota State reported that his
[SPEAKER_01]: observation was that they were resistant
to confirm they were resistant to stem
[SPEAKER_01]: rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar completed his term at the
boarding school and entered South Dakota
[SPEAKER_01]: State as a freshman at age 24 in 1914.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by that time he had already been doing
a lot of the hands-on work and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the self-driven work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually still have a lot of his
papers in the collection that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: archived at the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is his English paper,
English 10, that was the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the title of that paper was My Aim in
Coming to College.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it describes what drove him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, having received a fair
education in the School of Practical
[SPEAKER_01]: Experience in the University of Hard Knox,
we'll talk about that episode with Pancho
[SPEAKER_01]: and Hard Knox, at which institutions I
learned it was usually the man with the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific college training who comes out
ahead in all fields of human endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come to the conclusion that zeal,
and he had zeal, but zeal without
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge will achieve great things only
with difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was looking to add to his knowledge,
he had the zeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to achieve great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote that later on, that in 1913,
he decided to achieve great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that great thing was to achieve stem
rust and leaf rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1913, he set his pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing things like reaching out to
the USDA Office of Plant Industry asking
[SPEAKER_01]: for germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a letter I got out of the National
Archives asking for some beardless barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't working on just wheat,
but barley and corn, winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a publication, his first
publication, they screwed up his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was E.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden, not E.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden, but the paper has E.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on some interspecific crosses that
he was doing with rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back before we were developing
triticales, he was doing these rye and
[SPEAKER_01]: triticum crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the conventional knowledge at the
time, including coming out of places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell and South Dakota State and
Harvard, was that these crosses between
[SPEAKER_01]: species were impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the rationales are,
we know today that we have these varying
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes that we have in the triticums.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have emmer, which is a tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have common wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, they kept referring to it as
triticum vulgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's triticum astivum, which is a
hexaploid with the three genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of these genomic differences,
that it's impossible for these things to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't waste your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Edgar took this approach of wanting to
not listen to that and develop what he
[SPEAKER_01]: could in interspecific crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of his earlier attempts of that was in
wheat rye hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this paper that I mentioned
earlier that was published in this
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had a much bigger activity and a
much bigger project that he had underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was developing, starting in 1913,
his germplasm base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he utilized his farm to develop that
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned Mark wasn't an important
variety at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't really come into the Dakotas
until 1912.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had it in 1913.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing some pure line selections
out of marquis, the best possible plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and saving that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obtained Yaroslav emmer as a plant
introduction from USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a tetraploid that he obtained
seed of and grew that out on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made selections of seed or a selection
from a single rust-free plant off of his
[SPEAKER_01]: farm at Webster, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was obtaining materials also from other
lines of emmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a white spring emmer that he was
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was working with his own Acme durum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue stem wheat was another land race,
which was popular in the Northern Plains,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dakotas, and into Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I can never pronounce this
thing, but it's umelodurum, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: another introduction that the Minnesotans
used as a stem rust source for Thatcher
[SPEAKER_01]: and other releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar went about to make the Impossible
Cross in 1916.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had lived in a boarding house about two
blocks off the campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he did this work in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of his boarding house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would write that on July 4th,
he was busy making these crosses while the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the city was out celebrating the
nation's independence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he spent the 4th of July and
undoubtedly many other days paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to anthesis, but making crosses
as he had learned to do in his preparation
[SPEAKER_01]: with other crops and other attempts before
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was putting his two or three years
of crossing experience to work in this
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the crossing block that he had
in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed, I think this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The female parent was the tetraploid,
Yaroslav Emmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had Marquis, those selections out
of Marquis as the male parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he also crossed Marquis with another
tetraploid, Acme durum.
[SPEAKER_01]: White spring emmer was crossed with
Marquis and the other durum entry was
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with Marquis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he made all these hundreds and hundreds
of crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Edgar's field notes that are in the
archive at SDSU that go from 1915 to 1955.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I found this page, I was flipping
through it at home in front of the TV and
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started crying because I found
something very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife was kind of looking at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's zoom into the top half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are just a record of what the
entries were in 1917.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go back a couple slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1916, he made these crosses and obviously
he collected progeny, collected what seed
[SPEAKER_01]: he could off of these crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1916 is done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had a bunch of seed and he planted
that in a nursery at SDSU on the agronomy
[SPEAKER_01]: farm in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was planted on March 31st in
Brookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the various entries that
he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some Yaroslav emmers as controls
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I have a highlight on here is
that we have this Yaroslav emmer by
[SPEAKER_01]: Marquis F1 cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on in pencil, he said,
these are the parents of Hope Wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the only plant out of all that
that had viable progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one viable seed that came out of
all that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those other crosses that I mentioned
in 1916, nothing came of that in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: viable seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one plant that came out of this
inner specific cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of that, he planted that and in
1917 off of this plant, he harvested about
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 seeds that were the beginning of his
work, actually his life's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were some other challenges that
came in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1918, what was going on in 1918.
[SPEAKER_01]: World War I, Edgar was a patriot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of his family fought in the
Revolutionary War.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was proud of his heritage and his
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was proud to serve the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So South Dakota State and many other
colleges hastened their graduating class.
[SPEAKER_01]: They graduated in April, not in May or
June.
[SPEAKER_01]: They graduated in April so that they could
get these folks out and to their postings
[SPEAKER_01]: as World War I was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he graduated from South Dakota State in
1918, April 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's his diary there on the
left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_01]: May 4th, he said, well, I've gone and done
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got married to Mabel Lucille Bleak
Sleeve, better or worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I wrote something, well,
I have written things like that and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten, but we won't go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did a honeymoon out in the Black
Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before the month was done,
he reported for duty and was shipped off
[SPEAKER_01]: to Camp Lewis, Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we always made the assumptions that
you see here that he went on a harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: furlough and it was common for those folks
that were still posted domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could go home and help harvest the
crop because the crop was important to the
[SPEAKER_01]: war effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we always made this assumption that
Edgar said, I need to go harvest the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just didn't tell him that it was 100
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have the letters that show
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as he was leaving in May,
he was in communication with USDA and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Army to say, look, I got this important
work going on at Highmore, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And will I get a furlough to go collect
these important samples?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they let him do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA supported it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was upfront.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't any kind of shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a harvest furlough to do science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk about having some forethought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1918 rolls along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then November 11th, we have Armistice
Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if you can pick out the 5-foot,
4-inch Edgar McFadden out of this slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obvious that no, Edgar is the guy
third from the left in the front-hand row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looks like someone that's
encountered Pancho Villa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only this time, he's not going to run
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really looking at that camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get a big kick out of that
photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while Edgar was at Camp Lewis in
Washington state on November 7th,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I won't read this letter, but this is
one of my favorite artifacts that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had this newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he turned it sideways and put it into
the typewriter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wrote this letter to his bride back in
South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just asking, is war over or is it not?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been hearing news reports that
there's a discussion of treaty and
[SPEAKER_01]: armistice going on in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're wanting to know whether
they're going to ship off soon or they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also asking about what else was
going on in 1918 while it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: horrendous flu epidemic that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's asking about his father and other
family members.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the health of his mother, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love that he finishes it up as,
your husband, private, he asked me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear wife, your husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: The war ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't mention earlier that when he
finished up at Highmore, he graduated from
[SPEAKER_01]: SDSU.
[SPEAKER_01]: His first job was working at Highmore,
South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of my career at Highmore,
South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you blink while you're driving through
it, you probably miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to send things there to really a
stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 100 miles west of Brookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he lived at Highmore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a year later, after going to Camp
Lewis, he was right back at Highmore.
[SPEAKER_01]: To carry forward the cereal breeding
program, especially his hybrids between
[SPEAKER_01]: Emmer and Marcus Wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with lack of federal funding,
this sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was instructed to terminate the program
by 1920.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA, I have the letters from the National
Archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to recruit Edgar to be in
charge of the wheat program and move him
[SPEAKER_01]: to Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to be a desk jockey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he decided to go back to the farm
in Webster to farm and be a seeds man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got license from South Dakota State
to take all this material with him and
[SPEAKER_01]: further along the development of this
material on his own farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You folks could go through this better
than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to make some salient points on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the generational advancement
of the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That he made between Yaroslav Emmer and
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key points are he advanced lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a lot of bulking and population
selections for plumpness of grain and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did this in various environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brookings had started, then it moved to
Highmore for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Severe rust occurred in 1919.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of nice selection pressure there
and in 1920.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he went to the farm, his own farm in
1921, to continue to advance it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the years he got severe hail
occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he looked for those phenotypes that
were resistant to that hail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stalk strength came out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1924, by that time, he had 63 selections
that were grown in single rows or head
[SPEAKER_01]: rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time, he was evaluating yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says stem rust, leaf rust, protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gluten.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have a farina graph or mixograph
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did he determine gluten?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he did was pop about half a dozen
kernels in his mouth and chew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what breeders were doing then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you chew it to develop gluten and so it
was a subjective scale that people were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still remember doing that when I was an
undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do that, you weren't collecting data,
but you're just kind of doing a field
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers do that today, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take a few grains, pop them in
the mouth, start chewing it, crunch,
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch, crunch, but you're trying to
determine what kind of gluten formation
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to get out of that
wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He selected three lines, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were called H44, H49, H35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing really became of H35, but H44 and
H49 were monumental to the wheat industry
[SPEAKER_01]: around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1925, he decided to grow out H49,
that's what he was most interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obtained the most virulent lines,
the nine most virulent strains of stem
[SPEAKER_01]: rust, and he got them from Elven statement
just across the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he also did some seedling stage
evaluations also with some stem rust that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from Elven statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he surrounded that nursery with Marcus
wheat, and he got 100% failure of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus wheat, 100% failure of the Marcus
wheat from these infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But H49 was absent of stem rust,
completely absent after all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew he had something important,
so he released a variety, and he named it
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: He named it Hope because it was the hope
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's the registration
certificate for Hope wheat, shows Edgar as
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder based in Webster, South
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also made available at no cost this
germplasm to public breeders throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as me as a vice president in charge of
intellectual property, giving away things
[SPEAKER_01]: for free was, it wasn't allowed really by
border regions policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just think of how important that was
to developing stem rust resistant wheats
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the Great Plains, just
critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sent this out to his colleagues in
several different states and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, by this time, Manley
Champlin, his mentor was at University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Saskatchewan as a wheat breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led to several different derivatives,
new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look this up, probably do it on
your phone while you're sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he published this work in the
predecessor of Agronomy Journal,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Journal of the American Society of
Agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: He published this in 1930, and it was just
a description of everything that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: got done talking to you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: His description of how he developed Hope
wheat and what his experiences were in
[SPEAKER_01]: this preceding thought that such a thing
was impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrapped it up with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talked to that audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, here is good evidence that it
is possible to breed into our common
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat's desirable characteristics that are
found presently only in different groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as emmer, durum, einkorn,
rye, eagelops, and other related grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very important paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was age 34 at that time,
and he had made a tremendous success.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made a big splash in the wheat arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then USDA wanted him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they hired him back and started a new
experiment station in Redfield,
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota, just north of Highmore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where he raised his family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Redfield, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he talks about this period of time
from 1929 to 1935 as the worst part of his
[SPEAKER_01]: career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of leading his program and
developing something like Hope,
[SPEAKER_01]: now he was serving a whole bureaucracy in
USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serving other plant breeders, answering to
people at the main office in Minneapolis,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually St. Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he didn't really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he still had this theory that he
developed that I talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is we have spores that are
blowing up from the southern part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country into the north and then being
redistributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how is it that we're going to combat
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming here to talk at Cornell,
I love this photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know where this building is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the sixth Congress of Genetics
in April 1932 here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some great people that
attended.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Edgar McFadden up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara McClintock is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a participant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nikolai Vavilov.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nikolai Vavilov was at this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows that name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I ask that at other times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important figures in our
area of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hailed out of Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nikolai Vavilov.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have Paul Popano in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really wasn't an agronomist or crop
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: His brother, Wilson Popano, was one of
those plant explorers that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his son, Hugh Popano, I got to know as
a soil scientist at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Popano was into human eugenics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had an interesting and
disruptive career during his lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of interesting folks there.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC Stateman signed up as a participant,
but he's not in the photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just tragic, this is Nikolai Vavilov.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his mug shot when he was arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just grabbed this yesterday in my hotel
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to include it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how he was physically abused
at his arrest in 1940 by the Stalin
[SPEAKER_01]: regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he died in 1943 in a gulag in Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a tragic end to a great person with a
great mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar was complaining to USDA,
and he wanted to change his career.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I want to do something about stem
rust more so than what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, if we can develop stem rust
resistance in winter wheat and early
[SPEAKER_01]: spring wheats in Texas, what we will do is
disrupt the spore base and lower the spore
[SPEAKER_01]: count so that less spores are blown up
into more than great planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me to Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent Edgar McFadden, moved him from
his love, South Dakota, and he moved back
[SPEAKER_01]: down to Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stationed him at College Station,
Texas, as a USDA assistant agronomist.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time, Paul Mangelsdorf had already
obtained hope and H-44 and had bred that
[SPEAKER_01]: into his winter wheat lines that he was
developing in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Edgar was arriving in Texas,
Paul Mangelsdorf left to start his
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliant career in corn genetics at
Harvard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he left Texas A&M to go on to Harvard,
and he left behind all this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm that had hope in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Left that back behind for Edgar to take
advantage of, and Edgar did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did Edgar do or what was going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to touch about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember the Barbara Eradication
Program that the USDA, the US government
[SPEAKER_01]: put millions of dollars into to eradicate
barberry and try to lower the spore base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every black dot on this map is a farm
where barberry was eradicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about 100 years ago,
we didn't have glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have 2,4-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have herbicides to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did it with rock salt and with
kerosene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You identify a barberry bush or a plant,
and you just kill it with these materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't suffice to dig it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use these measures of rock salt
or kerosene to saturate the soil with
[SPEAKER_01]: kerosene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, where was the success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's 1935.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the percentage loss of the crop
that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stem rust in Minnesota, North Dakota,
South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: 105 million bushels of loss to stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little success and very little belief
that barberry control alone was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be important to the control of stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some periodic other
infestations later on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Percent stem rust loss of 30% in South
Dakota and 60% in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think of the economic impact that
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar started working in 1935.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started evaluating foreign
introductions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just had this massive evaluation
program going on of everything he could
[SPEAKER_01]: get his hands on from the USDA collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got accessions from Pavlov,
his colleague in Russia, and elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: materials out of South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started evaluating these things in
College Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: For susceptibility to stem rust and for
yield, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the materials he was
developing came out of Mangelsdorf
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program, the Hope by
Mediterranean crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was still continuing to work with
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a summary of what I just got
done saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was making some releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1938, he released Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin was really a cross that was done by
Mangelsdorf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Edgar made the selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a hope derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea Breeze was a soft red spring wheat
that he also developed out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: He developed a wonderful collaboration
with Ernest Sears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a name that people recognize?
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar McFadden and Ernest Sears started to
do their own intensive work of
[SPEAKER_01]: interspecific crosses and develop of
aneuploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they published together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgar McFadden and Ernest Sears,
1946, The Origin of Triticum Spelta and
[SPEAKER_01]: Its Free Thrashing Hexploid Relatives,
the same title, two citations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Journal of Heredity, volume 37,
page 81, and also volume 37107.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a version of part one and part
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting read, some of our earliest
understandings of how wheat evolved over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has changed since that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an interesting paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote in there, he said,
McFadden wrote that he postulated in 1913
[SPEAKER_01]: that vulgar wheats were fixed hybrids
between emers and another wild relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he started preliminary
experiments in the summer of 1913.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to jump into a different
phase of the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, let's look at Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Edgar's trying to develop these stem
rust resistant lines in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Henry Wallace made a trip
before the presidential elections in 1940
[SPEAKER_01]: down to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were worried about Mexico joining the
access powers prior to our involvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back and said, what we can do
to prevent Mexico or mitigate the risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico joining the access powers is to
help them with poverty and to help them
[SPEAKER_01]: with food security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bring some of our agricultural
research expertise to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also wrote that if we do that,
let's focus on beans, corn, and wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's wheat, we're going to focus on
stem rust resistance and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility to get the protein level up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a delegation funded by the
Rockefeller Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steakman was part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mangelsdorf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bradfield, I believe, was on this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bradfield out of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we in Bradfield Hall now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we're in Emerson?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're next door to Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that name comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a massive tour of the entire
country to discern what the problems are
[SPEAKER_01]: of common people in Mexico, including
establishment of some of their operations
[SPEAKER_01]: in Chippingo, just right outside of
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_01]: With those recommendations of focusing
first on stem rust, where are they going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they going to get their
materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're going to go to Edgar
McFadden, who happens to be living in
[SPEAKER_01]: College Station, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Edgar wrote back to this Rockefeller
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had three recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll only provide two of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, let's do Chippingo experiment
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what his handwritten note said,
Chippingo experiment one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are bulks from Edgar McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He provided 60 bulks, including 15 crosses
of some of Mangelsdorf material and some
[SPEAKER_01]: other materials with some other
introductions that came out of South
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also provided his new variety,
Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then experiment two were wheat
selections, 44 selections that he just
[SPEAKER_01]: provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, start evaluating.
[SPEAKER_01]: He laid out all the experimental designs
and how to analyze the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just laid it all out for them,
black and white, and sent it and shared
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they did in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was being led by Dutch Harar,
George Harar, who later became president
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dutch Harar took that advice and
implemented it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, he was also doing some
collections of accessions within Mexico
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he started this program in Mexico
in 1943.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, fast forward, by December of
1944, they had the 100 best phenotypes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they drew those selections down
to the 20 best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this individual, Dr. Borlaug,
he wasn't on the scene until December.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the scene until November of
1944.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that work had been done by the time
Norman Borlaug arrived in Chepingo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a wooden table with packets of
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of this were hope derivatives that
were provided in the program was
[SPEAKER_01]: visualized and drafted by Edgar McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They communicated with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the great head start that Norman
Borlaug got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, the Rockefeller Foundation
identified five lines of promise that they
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the seed increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got three tons of Rockefeller
Foundation number 211, a ton of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: four tons of 209, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of these were hope derivatives from
McFadden's selections in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the crosses weren't made in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were made by McFadden at Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: McFadden was hired as a consultant by the
Rockefeller Foundation and made a site
[SPEAKER_01]: visit in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at the information, did site
visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, Rockefeller 2012,
so there's 2012, that's a Trigo Supreme by
[SPEAKER_01]: 116 Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was eliminated and discarded,
but everything else was advanced for
[SPEAKER_01]: variety release, including the two that
had the hope background was released as
[SPEAKER_01]: Supremo and another as Frontera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were released as varieties by
the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in crop science as the variety
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Edgar McFadden in that information was
named as the breeder of the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The target audience were farmers,
not only in Texas, but in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea was to have a stem rust
resistant line dominating the landscape to
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupt stem rust spore development and
thereby protecting the rest of the core of
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those things that you get
from the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you open up the files,
you say, wow, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a photograph in the Houston
Chronicle of Edgar and Norman Borlaug
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with a farmer in Texas about
Supremo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmer was very happy and
impressed with the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was getting out of that particular
variety, kind of a testament, 1951,
[SPEAKER_01]: so late in the utility of Supremo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say late in the utility because a
letter came out in 1950 out of the Russ
[SPEAKER_01]: lab at the University of Minnesota,
out of Stakeman's lab, that trouble was
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new race, Race 15B, was making its
presence in the Northern Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most virulent race ever isolated
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was starting to take out varieties
that were previously deemed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, eventually it made its
way and got established in the Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: United States as well, including Texas and
including Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it essentially took out Supremo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the breeding program under Norman
Borlaug, they had to develop varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that were a combination of hope background
and Kenyan backgrounds to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: withstand stem rust and seedling stages as
well as adult stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: George Harar wrote this about McFadden in
51.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he called him Dr. McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never had a PhD, but he had by that
time an honorary doctorate from South
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was calling him Dr. McFadden of
College Station Provided Bulk Wheat in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early days of the program in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just kind of go down to the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, we're not for the fact that these
varieties must now be withdrawn because of
[SPEAKER_01]: 15B.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt that Supremo would be the
single most important wheat variety in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was thanking McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was this about Hope Wheat?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the person that un-teased all of
that, the person that took the baton from
[SPEAKER_01]: that work and really did the genetics work
was Bob McIntosh out at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Sydney out in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gotten to know Bob through this
work that I've been doing about McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's gotten to know McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had Bob in Brookings just last May
as part of the McFadden symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stole in some of his slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob, so what Bob said about Hope in
H44, is that, yes, indeed, at the time of
[SPEAKER_01]: release, Hope and H44 were highly
resistant to stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes back to a couple important
genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those used to be SR1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's recognized as SR9D was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's primarily the source of
resistance for seedling stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance in these varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's SR2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And SR2 is still recognized as the most
important resistance gene to adult stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of stem rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stem rust expression in adult plant
stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still counting on SR2 in varieties
and places against EG99 and other problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about SR2 and SR9.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go through these a little
bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the bottom line that we have
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: SR2 has some pleiotropic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always see some pseudo black chaff or
brown necrosis in varieties that are
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed in SR2.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is linked to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very attractive trait to have
expressed in wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wheat industry millers don't
especially like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really impact yield or impact
the quality or performance per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is an anti-quality trait that
people don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see black chaff, you have SR2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice marker to be used for if
SR2 is what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes SR2 or the black chaff causes a
misdiagnosis with other diseases like
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it causes people to unnecessarily treat
fungicides on those types of varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'll head into the finish line here
and just talk about recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1945, so as the World War was ending,
this article comes out written by A.W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Erickson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I didn't know this was in
existence until Cindy sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a little write up that sold
for $0.25 at Rexall stores and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how he developed hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's essentially the same thing that
was published in 1930.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had some other information in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this article, this little booklet,
Erickson attributed winning World War II
[SPEAKER_01]: to Hope Wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a war is fought with guns and
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to feed our troops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to feed the people that we are
occupying and liberating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of our development in wheat,
and the success that it had on the wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, we could occupy and save Europe,
post-war Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could save post-war Japan because
of the abundance of wheat that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: during that period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would not have had that if not for
hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was attributing to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I've drank that Kool-Aid
myself, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led to other honors and recognitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reader's Digest had a big write up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Texas, he was a scroll of honor in
the Chemergic Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk a little bit about October 10,
1947, McFadden Appreciation Day back in
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see he's a fellow of the
American Society of Agronomy and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a whole host of honors and
recognitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of South Dakota, because of his
work in Texas, recognized him for
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupting the Spore Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And saving wheat industry up and down the
Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of South Dakota brought him
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they built this granite monument to
Edgar McFadden in his hometown of Webster,
[SPEAKER_01]: South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor was there to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all the speeches and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Edgar there receiving his
recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it looks today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under three feet of snow today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how it looks today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still there in Webster, South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm driving down Highway 12,
I always make a stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some illustrations in the Reader's
Digest article.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA recognized him with the Distinguished
Service Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bestowed on him in National Mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a theater there by the Washington
Monument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there on the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where Edgar received his
recognition in DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at this graduation event that he
got the honorary doctorate degree at South
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1955, he received a letter from the
John Scott Medal Award people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the John Scott Award is very
prestigious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not have ever heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear of it until after I was
diving into McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes to the most deserving men and
women whose inventions have contributed to
[SPEAKER_01]: some outstanding outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started in the early 1800s by John
Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a Scottish druggist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he entrusted money to the city of
Philadelphia, which was the heart of our
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Silicon Valley of the United
States back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gave this money in trust to the
city of Philadelphia to periodically
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize those people that make
monumental innovative contributions to
[SPEAKER_01]: society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other recipients have been Madame
Curie and Thomas Edison, the Wright
[SPEAKER_01]: Brothers, Jonas Salk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He recognized all of those names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got a letter saying, we would like
to know about you because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: considering you for this honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote back saying, I didn't invent
stem rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to convince him to be
cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked Elvin Stakeman to support his
nomination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Elvin kind of said, OK, but he's no
one really special because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing Thatcher and other lines as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Elvin Stakeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, they were persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they conferred this honor onto Edgar
McFadden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He received it at the AAAS meetings in,
I think it was in Atlanta, in late
[SPEAKER_01]: December of 1955.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 10 days later, Edgar passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's his headstone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cindy and I have visited his headstone in
College Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, a workman that needed not be
ashamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died in his sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through this work, I've gotten to know the
family very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cindy and I are both honorary family
members.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call us cousins in all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very much involved in this effort
as a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was a workman that need not be
ashamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about what he went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a son of pioneers and community
developers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He himself was a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he practiced agricultural science,
made a life of self-sacrifice and a
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment to science.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was self-driven, self-motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He often called how proud he was as a
veteran that heeded the nation's call to
[SPEAKER_01]: the colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that term that he used.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used another term that I forgot to
mention that I love, and that was radical
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This notion of inner-specific crosses 100
years ago that was thought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible, he called that radical plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would give seminars on radical
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope all of you that are plant
breeders are radical plant breeders as
[SPEAKER_01]: well to carry forward that legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Numerous crop varieties that he released
in his career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe he was the most innovative
plant breeder during that period of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1913 to 1956.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, that's the end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much for this welcome and
for a great audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take some questions if there's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
