[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Myles Schwartzax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a graduate student here at the
Department of Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the Urban Horticultural
Institute, and I'm going to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: today about a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm going to talk about the concept
of soil health and how this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important way that we're starting to think
about soils in this day and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going to talk about some of
the research that I've been conducting
[SPEAKER_00]: while I've been here at Cornell,
particularly pertaining to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation using a technique we call the
scoop and dump method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off here,
like I said, talking about soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about soil health,
what we're thinking about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: integration of multiple aspects of soil
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three main areas that we're
talking about are the physical,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological, and the chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, kind of traditionally in soil
testing, we've mostly focused on just the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical aspects of soils, which are very
important aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's kind of a bigger picture and
more to be told with the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of soil health is finding
the most important indicators of your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that are responsive to management,
so it can be changed by a practitioner,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also correlate well with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at Cornell, we developed the soil
health test out of the Crop and Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this test does is it's a set of
standards, like I just described,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when integrated together kind of
gives you a holistic picture of your
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this test is just like any other soil
test that you could send a sample into and
[SPEAKER_00]: have results sent back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But different from maybe strictly a
biological or a chemical test,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cover a bunch of different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about physical,
we're mostly referring to is aggregate
[SPEAKER_00]: stability, water-holding capacity,
bulk density, texture, and resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: or compaction is a synonym.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about biological,
mostly what we're thinking about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is gonna cover organic matter,
active carbon, which is just a fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: total organic matter, as well as soil
respiration and protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when we're looking at chemicals,
we're gonna be primarily looking at pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as well as our macro and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I go through this talk today,
I'm gonna introduce these kind of concepts
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we talk about my results,
I'm gonna give a little more detail about
[SPEAKER_00]: what these actually mean for the
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about soil health,
we're talking about looking at specific
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators within specific aspects of our
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about the physical
aspects, we're mainly talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates, so the actual particles that
conglomerate together in your soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so size and distribution, as well as
stability, how easy they break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about porosity, how easy,
how much air is in your soil, and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: space is between your aggregates in your
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about bulk density,
which specifically refers to weight by
[SPEAKER_00]: volume, and is a very good indicator for
compaction, which can oftentimes be a
[SPEAKER_00]: large inhibiting factor in our soils,
or at least our abilities to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow landscape plants directly in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance, as well, which is another
measure of compaction, which we can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrometer, a very easy field tool to
use to get a quick sense of what our
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well as water holding capacity,
how much water is in the soil that is
[SPEAKER_00]: available for your plants, and water
infiltratability, so how quickly water can
[SPEAKER_00]: move into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move on to the soil biological
factors, mostly what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: is the microorganisms that we find in our
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these play a very important role and
have been an area of research that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been gaining more traction and more focus
in recent history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of what the biological factors
tend to focus on is the ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms to mediate soil nutrients
turning over in the soil, as well as them
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the fixation of nitrogen is a common
benefit we see from soil biological
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, as well as detoxification of
pollutants and the maintenance of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we're kind of thinking about soil
biology, the kind of mantra that I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with, or that you tend to hear
frequently, is that what we're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, specifically with nutrients,
is feeding the soil, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding the plants specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into this a little bit more
as we continue our talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third major area is soil
chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil chemical refers to the specific
micro and macro nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_00]: required for plants to be able to grow and
thrive in a given environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the specific pH, which is also
going to be a limiting factor for what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of plants you can use in that soil,
and then cation exchange capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which specifically refers to the ability
for soil to hold on to nutrients and then
[SPEAKER_00]: allow them to be plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a quick summary of what soil
health is and the general concepts that go
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to move now into talking a
little bit about urban soils and
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're unfamiliar with the concept
of urban soils, what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're talking about urban soils are
soils that are non-agricultural,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily naturally forming or not
naturally forming, and in one way or
[SPEAKER_00]: another are influenced by human impacts
and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a definition that I like to use is
non-agricultural man-made surface layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 50 centimeters thick,
that has been produced by a mixing,
[SPEAKER_00]: filling, or contamination of land service
in urban and suburban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about urban soils,
what this can really refer to is it could
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to parks, it could refer to botanic
gardens, it could refer to right of ways
[SPEAKER_00]: on highways, it could be talking about
urban, like city cores, or even suburban,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like people's yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soils that are in one way or another
are influenced by human activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we define urban soils
in the first place is because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of set characteristics that we tend
to find in our urban soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these characteristics typically tend
to have adverse effects on the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that we wish to put in those
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tend to find in an urban system
is high soil bulk density, decreases in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, poor structure,
high pH, low water holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a decrease in aggregate stability,
inadequate depth for roots to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferate in the soil, and as well as a
decrease in microbial biomass and
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at Cornell, we were trying to
think of ways of how to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: proactively deal with urban soils and some
of the challenges that we tend to see with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Urban Horticultural Institute in
the Unabasic's lab, we focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: developing this technology known as the
scoop and dump technique of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the practice is relatively
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do is you come in with compost
into a compacted and disturbed urban soil
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you apply that compost at a rate of
six to eight inches on the top of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come in with either a backhoe
or mini excavator, or you can even do it
[SPEAKER_00]: with shovels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you physically use your
backhoe to fracture and scoop down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, reaching into the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lift it up that soil, shake it,
and drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is it creates a
heterogeneous mixture of compost and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that point, you can either
rototill it or just iron rake it over to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a smooth planting surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will apply mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have at this point is a
planting bed that is now you can directly
[SPEAKER_00]: put plants into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly we've used this with shrubs and
tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a few pictures of what it
kind of looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this technique either by using
a backhoe or by using, if you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of help, you can do it by shovels,
but it's accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use it to either create large
planting beds or very small planting beds
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to just put one tree in or
just a few shrubs, or if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: renovate a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Cornell campus, we've been
doing the scoop and dump practice for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 14 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a part of the Unabasics Creating the
Urban Eden Woody Plant ID and Landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishment class, every year the class
will create a new garden on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they design this garden and then
eventually install it, they've been using
[SPEAKER_00]: the scoop and dump technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've used this technique in a various
number of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of outside of Mann
Library when we were doing construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, and you can see the
landing area right in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another angle of that of what a
construction landscape looked like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what the landscape looks like
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we've come in, we've used the scoop
and dump technique to remediate the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it is a place where it went from
highly compacted and impacted from
[SPEAKER_00]: construction to a place where we're having
our landscape plants thrive and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to kind of look at the scoop
and dump technique and learn a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to find how changes in soil
quality based on soil health had changed
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to doing the scoop and dump
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also wanted to look at this to see
how, since we had 12 years worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, or 14 years at this point,
we were able to see over time also how
[SPEAKER_00]: changes were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected three sites where this
technique had been applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three sites directly adjacent to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way we could do a control type
experiment where we had plants growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we had soils that had been developed by
the scoop and dump technique, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: had areas that were close by that had
received similar impacts, but had not gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through the same remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to these sites and we took soil
cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were about this size, and we took
these cores, and we extracted samples
[SPEAKER_00]: directly from our scoop and dump soils,
and then at equal depth we also took them
[SPEAKER_00]: in our unamended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went just below our mulch level,
because as I mentioned, when you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop and dump technique, you add mulch
every year, as you would in any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape bed establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we selected our unamended or control
soils at the same depth as we found our
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop and dump soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through the results
that we found of our study, and as I
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss these, I'm also going to discuss
some of the soil quality indicators and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a sense of not just what
happened, but giving a broader picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I'm going to talk about
is aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're talking about when we're
referring to aggregate stability is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the soil aggregates,
these large particles that have
[SPEAKER_00]: conglomerated together, and their ability
to resist destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the destructive forces that we apply
on them are water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two ways you can look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either look at this by flooding,
how much the aggregates break apart when
[SPEAKER_00]: inundated with water, or you can look at
it as we do in the soil health lab using a
[SPEAKER_00]: rain infiltrometer here, which simulates a
very heavy rainstorm event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, the more stable your
aggregates, the less they break apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better that is for your soil
structure, and just generally creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more agreeable environment to put
our plants directly into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at the scoop and dump
versus our controlled soils, what we found
[SPEAKER_00]: is that our scoop and dump soils had 72%
aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare this to our unamended,
we see that our unamended is at about 34%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just by doing the scoop and dump
technique, coming in and incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter and physically fracturing
the soil, and mulching over their site,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw that we had almost double the
amount of aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we have organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're talking about when we're
talking about organic matter is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily carbon that is derived from a
living source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether this be plant or animal
residues, or microorganisms that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding in the soil, it's a little more
involved than that, but it's a basic
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic matter is a very important
component of our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people kind of think or kind
of know that it tends to be the more
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter you have in the soils,
it improves structure, and it certainly is
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for cation exchange capacity,
therefore the ability for soil to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: onto nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a functioning ecosystem where we
want our plants to thrive and survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter is a very important
indicator to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, when we look across these
sites, what we see is that our scoop and
[SPEAKER_00]: dump soils, we have 8.43% organic matter
compared to our unamended that is at 3.23.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost three times your organic matter
after doing this incorporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense since we're adding
compost, we're adding a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, but it's good to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, there's active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a newer test that some
people may not be as familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're talking about when we talk
about active carbon is essentially it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the fraction of your organic matter that
is available for soil microorganisms to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume and to use as a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So active carbon is a biological indicator
and it really is a little different than
[SPEAKER_00]: our total organic matter because that
refers to all of the organic matter we
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active carbon is just a fraction of it and
is this food source for our soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms which play mediating roles
in our nutrient turnovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see when we look at active
carbon is that our active carbon we are up
[SPEAKER_00]: around 1,022 parts per million compared to
our unamended at 361.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so almost, we have more than three
times the amount of active carbon in our
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop and dump soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving over to water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water holding capacity specifically refers
to the amount of water that is being held
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil that is available to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one end of the extreme, you have
field capacity, which is the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's held in the soil when you've
had a large rain event and just due to
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity alone, the water is drained out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water that is held in the
soil after that draining event is known as
[SPEAKER_00]: field capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other end of the spectrum,
you have what's known as permanent wilting
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And permanent wilting point refers to the
point where the amount of water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is known no longer available to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants cannot pull it up from their
roots and therefore the plant will start
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a drought response at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water holding capacity is between these
two extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important as you'd imagine
for thinking about irrigation and also
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about just general maintenance of
plants in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see with available water
holding capacity is that in our scoop and
[SPEAKER_00]: dump, we ended up with 0.23.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can compare this to our
unamended, which is 0.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these differences may not look as
large as some of our other indicators,
[SPEAKER_00]: but statistically this is quite
significant and we see that our scoop and
[SPEAKER_00]: dump soils do hold significantly more
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next indicator I'm gonna talk about
is potentially mineralizable nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this indicator refers to
specifically is the conversion of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from an organic form into an inorganic
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going from plant unavailable to plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have up here on picture of this
slide is the full nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna go into full detail
about this, but this is just kind of one
[SPEAKER_00]: component of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially mineralizable nitrogen is
another biological indicator since this is
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated by soil microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also since nitrogen is such an
important element or nutrient for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, an important one to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at potentially
mineralizable nitrogen in our scoop and
[SPEAKER_00]: dump compared to our unamended soils,
what we found is that we had almost 10
[SPEAKER_00]: times the amount of potentially
mineralizable nitrogen compared to our
[SPEAKER_00]: unamended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 27.5 free parts per million compared to
3.11 in our unamended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we looked at resistance using a
pentrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pentrometer for people who aren't
familiar with it, is this instrument right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a pressure gauge on one side and a
measuring bar in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you take this and you
can push it into your soil at a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: rate and measure at what point your soils
reach a pressure of 300 PSI or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the significance of 300 PSI is that
that is the kind of point in your soils
[SPEAKER_00]: where roots can no longer proliferate in a
compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know if you're below that threshold
that your roots are going to grow fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're above it, then you have a
compaction issue and you need to address
[SPEAKER_00]: it one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some limitations to using this
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to use it directly a short time
after it rains, especially if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be doing a lot of different sites
because soil moisture can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in how you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great way to just get a quick
estimate of what the compaction looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why we talk about it in terms of soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we looked at our scoop and
dump compared to our unamended,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we found is that in our scoop and
dump we could go down to 9.74 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: before reaching our root limiting PSI
compared to our unamended, which was at
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.44 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had three times the rooting volume
or depth available to us that plants could
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explore and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next we looked at bulk density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I discussed before what bulk
density is, is a measure of weight by
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another indicator that's
important to consider when looking
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically at compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit more telling than using
the resistance measure or the pentrometer
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty straightforward to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use these rings typically to
measure bulk density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hammer these into the soil,
get them kind of flush so we know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: volume's in here specifically,
dry them out, and then weigh that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can tell the bulk density just
like we can tell with resistance is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know depending on texture that once you
get above a specific bulk density you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to have trouble having roots grow
and proliferate in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in sands it's 1.75 grams per centimeter
cubed compared to silts and clay,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is around 1.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers may not mean a lot right
now, but as I discussed bulk density
[SPEAKER_00]: several times throughout this talk it's
going to start to make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found in our scoop and dump
soils is that we were at 0.89 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter cubed, which is well below that
1.4 threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of texture we saw that by
doing this process that we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce our bulk density and create a
medium where roots are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier time growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare this to our unamended,
which is up at 1.47.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on texture you're kind of
just getting to that root limiting range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we did our first kind of study
where we looked at scoop and dump soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and to compare and contrast setting,
we also wanted to look at how did these
[SPEAKER_00]: soils change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected a cross section of 12 years
and we selected six sites out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: that represented that time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at this in
chronosequence what we found out is that
[SPEAKER_00]: over time our bulk density decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that our potentially
mineralizable nitrogen, our nitrogen that
[SPEAKER_00]: is being converted from an organic to an
inorganic form, also significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: increased over time, as well as our active
carbon, the portion of our total organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that is available for
microorganisms to use as a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really exciting to see this
because when we did our first study what
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see is that yes, by going in and
doing the scoop and dump practice we
[SPEAKER_00]: improved, we improved soil quality almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first piece of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw when we looked at this over
time is that by going in and doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: once and then mulching every year that
there is an increased benefit that keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: on going after we've used this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active carbon as well as potentially
mineralizable nitrogen are both biological
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us a good clue into what's
going on with the microbes in our soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: their ability to to mediate soil health
and as well as this bulk density which
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to create an environment where
after we've established these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have a lot easier time
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all very exciting to see and
what we wanted to do next was say alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen that we've improved our soil
quality and that's a great thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also want to see how plants respond
to these changes in soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set up a soil container study where
we went out again to our scoop and dump
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and our unamended sites and we took
large cores, PVC cores, that we hammered
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground and pulled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were then able to take these soils,
bring them into a growth chamber and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in them specifically to see how the
plants responded to this improved
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to look at a number of
different factors, but first what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: when we took these, we used a ficus
benjamina, which is known as a tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: street tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this because we were running this
experiment in the winter, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes a plant you do find in the
urban environment in tropical and
[SPEAKER_00]: subtropical regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first things we looked at after
growing and establishing these ficus
[SPEAKER_00]: benjamina was just what were the gross
plant growth response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here that in our scoop and dump
soils compared to our unamended ficus that
[SPEAKER_00]: were grown in there had significantly more
leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf area was the first indicator that we
looked at, up at 933 centimeters squared
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to our unamended, which was at
578 centimeters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So significantly more leaf area was put on
by the plants growing just in the scoop
[SPEAKER_00]: and dump soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we destructively harvested and
extracted the roots and the shoots from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, what we found is that we had
significantly more dry weight of roots for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants growing in our scoop and dump soil
compared to our unamended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these differences do not look
giant, but statistically they are
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the dry weight of shoots,
we also had significantly more shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: growth compared in our scoop and dump
soils compared to our unamended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, like in our last study,
we also looked at bulk density,
[SPEAKER_00]: this measure of weight by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found again is that our scoop
and dump soils were at this 0.97 range,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is again well below that 1.4
threshold compared to our unamended soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are up in the 1.68 on average range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see limitations in
the soil based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we did a linear
regression where we looked at bulk density
[SPEAKER_00]: by our dry weight of shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shoots referring to everything from the
soil line up, so leaves and any woody
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass that was developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is a very strong
relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the blue, we have our scoop and dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more shoots on the axis here,
as well as higher bulk densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is a very clear
relationship where we're actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the lower bulk density is correlating
very strongly with more dry weights of
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in our unamended soil that
this line right here is our 1.4 threshold
[SPEAKER_00]: where you start seeing root limiting bulk
densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all kind of clustered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at the dry weight of
roots as well, we see a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of our reduced bulk density
correlating with more root growth as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as our leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same pattern yet again where we
have strong correlations with reductions
[SPEAKER_00]: in bulk density and increases in leaf
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did this destructive harvest
after we had pulled the plants out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soils containers that they had been
growing in, there was a few observations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were made that weren't so easy to
necessarily quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big things that we saw was
just where the roots were exploring in
[SPEAKER_00]: these containers and how much more biomass
they were putting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty clear picture of our
scoop and dump roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a much larger root system
developing here compared to our unamended,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just not nearly as dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting when we looked
specifically at where the roots were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the container is that in our unamended
soils, plants that were growing in our
[SPEAKER_00]: soils that had not been remediated,
that had this higher bulk density,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we would typically see is that where
we planted the ficus in the container,
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be roots that were growing
right where we stuck the plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then oftentimes what the roots would
do is they'd grow up from that plug across
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the container and then down the
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the roots were actually doing
in this scenario was they were not
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring the majority of the soil volume
in these unamended soils, but finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to kind of follow the path of least
resistance and looking for an area where
[SPEAKER_00]: they could grow and escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very similar pattern that you
see here where you kind of came down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle where you planted the plug and
then they'd escape off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare this to what we see in our
scoop and dump soils, the roots growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: our scoop and dump soils had the ability
to really grow throughout the full amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd explore between those aggregates in
those different airspace and the volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't do the same escaping
pattern, they would just grow throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when you tried to break the soils
apart in your unamended soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start to break the roots and the
soil apart, the soil would just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fall away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our scoop and dump soils, you'd really
have to work really hard to actually free
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil from the roots to be able to get
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was all exciting to see and kind
of in summary, I talked about early on
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the issues that we see in
urban soils and characterization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by coming in and doing the scoop and
dump process, we've been able to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of them, pretty much
everything except for the high pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing the scoop and dump process,
we were able to decrease our bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: densities, increase our organic matter,
improve our soil structure, increase our
[SPEAKER_00]: water holding capacity, increase our
aggregate stability, improve our soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganism community, and as well as
create more soil volume for plants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a few shots of locations where
we've used this technique and what some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gardens look like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm going to take the last little
bit of time in this talk to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the practicalities of implementing
this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I want to show is just
a cost estimate of some of the parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're looking at if we want to
actually implement this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main costs associated with the scoop
and dump technique are your compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as getting a backhoe machine in to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on where you work,
if you work in a place that already has
[SPEAKER_00]: access, if you make your own compost,
this cost can be eliminated or decreased,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as if you work in a place where
you have access to a machine, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: rental costs that I've projected here are
not going to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, it is possible to
do this technique also just with shovels
[SPEAKER_00]: and by hand, but a very important aspect
of the scoop and dump technique is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the physical fracturing of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not simply adding compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost with the mixing is what
creates this soil mixture and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: we find the benefits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to make that point kind of
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So estimates on an 100 square foot bed,
depending if you want to go, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: your depth of compost you want to apply,
if we're talking about about the six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: range, which would be fairly typical,
that would take about just under two yards
[SPEAKER_00]: of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I estimated in this measurement for
the Bobcat mini excavator to be rented for
[SPEAKER_00]: a three hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're talking about for 100 square
foot bed is about $212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scale that up to a thousand square foot
bed, which would be a fairly large size
[SPEAKER_00]: bed, but certainly something if you're
planning a large installation is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch depth, you're looking somewhere
around $725.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's important to think about where
your compost is coming from, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: source and how expensive that is going to
be as well as the machine use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one kind of point when we do think
about costs that I want to bring up is
[SPEAKER_00]: just the idea that we know that this
technique improves your soils over the
[SPEAKER_00]: long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to think about it more in
terms of making an initial investment and
[SPEAKER_00]: then over time it's going to continue to
pay off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be particularly
pronounced if you're working in a site
[SPEAKER_00]: that has had plant failure in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using this technique you're going to
hopefully be able to decrease on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: failure and therefore be saving money by
not having to replace those plants nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: so often, or hopefully not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it does come to selecting plants
to be putting in this bed, what we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about in the urban horticultural institute
is always selecting your plants based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your site's limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the urban horticultural institute has
a number of different resources available
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you figure out what your site
limitations are, and I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about them kind of briefly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one we oftentimes consider is
to be cold hardiness, and most people are
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very good maps by the USDA which
will tell you what zone you're in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you always want to select your plant
first based on zone so you know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can thrive on the minimum temperature that
you find in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you consider is soil pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could have very acidic soils or
very basic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this, again, there's not much
we can do except for select the right
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are going to like that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make changes to soil pH,
that is a possibility, but oftentimes when
[SPEAKER_00]: we think about in the urban setting,
a cost that we do not tend to incur
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't actually tend to change
the soil's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to select a plant that can
deal with the kind of pH range you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of going out and buying a lot of
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the next indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either they're going to have full sun,
which is six hours or more in a game,
[SPEAKER_00]: given day, part shade, which is going to
be less than that, or full shade,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is maybe at most an hour of light in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next area that we consider is to be
moisture, which is how much water is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you have a site that frequently
floods or frequently drains very fast and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually stays very kind of dry,
or if you're lucky enough to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can kind of do both,
it will infiltrate water quickly but also
[SPEAKER_00]: hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well as salt exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we see
particularly in a lot of institutional
[SPEAKER_00]: type settings or as well as in
transportation type areas where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: either getting salt exposure from de-icing
salts or salt soils if you're in a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country where salinity is an issue in
your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a great resource available to
us here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Woody Plant database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about the Woody Plant
database is you can go onto it and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out your site's limitations, plug those
into our database, and what will happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: it will generate a list of plants that are
appropriate for your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
some of these assessments, most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments of site limitation you can do
on your own in a pretty straightforward
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a way, and then you can use the
Woody Plant database to find plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to work for your landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another resource available to people is
the Site Assessment Checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from a book written by the
Urban Horticultural Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Recommended Urban Trees,
Site Assessment, and Tree Selection for
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress Tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to the database I was referring
to a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this book, it's free and available
on our website online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can go through, and they also have
a checklist where you can actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: through each of your specific limitations
and kind of check them off for a given
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can use that information to
then select plants after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned before, I've talked a
lot about the concept of soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has a soil health testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually take soils and collect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And send them into the lab, and they can
go through a battery of tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the ones I've talked about today,
as well as some other ones that I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for $85, you can get a full package
where you get a really good picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that this is a great tool
to use specifically if you're doing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: management technique on a piece of land,
and you kind of want to see how your soils
[SPEAKER_00]: respond over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most soil testing, you always want to do
it before you're about to establish a new
[SPEAKER_00]: site, or if you're trying to understand
what's going on with a site specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're having issues with some of your
plant failure, or you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a better sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also something that's good to
test over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's really convenient about
the soil health test is that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you test one year, maybe two or
three years down the line, you can test
[SPEAKER_00]: again, and you can kind of see how your
soils have changed in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few add-ons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're concerned about heavy metals,
you can add that onto the test,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as soluble salts, if that is
another concern for you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if you don't want to go and
get the full package for $85, you can also
[SPEAKER_00]: send in and get what we call a cart or
specific tests done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say if you're going to get a
minimum set of tests, you should get your
[SPEAKER_00]: texture looked at, you should get your
organic matter looked at, and you should
[SPEAKER_00]: get your pH looked at, since these are
all, at least texture and pH is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're probably not going to be
addressing in changing on your site,
[SPEAKER_00]: but will be very informative when you want
to select plants for that landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's actually a whole bunch of
tests that you can do on your own,
[SPEAKER_00]: the do-it-yourself assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are bulk density, resistance
with a penetrometer, pH, and then some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the site limitations, which I was
discussing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So texture, light, hardiness, salt
exposure, and moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just talk about doing some
of these assessments yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I'm going to talk about is
specifically bulk density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulk density, as I've mentioned many
times, is a measurement of weight by
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a lot of soil testing,
it's wise to invest in a soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: a can that you can use specifically to
test these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty straightforward process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to buy one of these,
you can also cut off two ends of a soup
[SPEAKER_00]: can, anything that you know the specific
size on, or you can measure and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to show here, briefly touch
on, is the actual technique of taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk density measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty straightforward process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you really need for it is just a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a wood block, you need a can,
and you need a hammer, as well as an oven
[SPEAKER_00]: at home and a cookie sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a specific soil core that
people who are doing a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling will use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to purchase one of
these, you're only doing maybe one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, you can also use something like a
soup can as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, of course, want to be careful not to
cut yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anything that you can measure the
height, as well as the diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can calculate the volume
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulk density is a specific measurement of
weight by volume, and therefore tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: our compaction in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technique is pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go out to a site, and if it's
turfed, what we'll do is we'll slice the
[SPEAKER_00]: turf layer off, and then we'll come in and
we'll take our core, put it on the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top of the soil, come in with our
block, and our hammer, and hammer it down
[SPEAKER_00]: until your soil level just reaches the top
of the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you can smooth it out,
and then you're going to come in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: trowel, trowel underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to get a cap, but if you don't
want to get a cap, you can use anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cap one side of it, flip it over,
smooth the soil out as well, and this way
[SPEAKER_00]: you know now you're have a known amount of
volume of soil within this canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take this soil, push it into a
bag, you take that bag of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it home, put it on a cookie sheet,
put it in your oven at 200 degrees for two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three hours until all the moisture has
evaporated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that soil out, allow it to
dry, and then weigh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you know the volume of your
cylinder and the weight, you can then
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out your weight by volume,
and therefore you know your bulk density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next kind of do-it-yourself assessment
is looking at soil resistance with a
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are available from Cornell directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can borrow them for a week at a time,
where we'll ship them out to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get one of these penetrometers
if you wanted to look at compaction across
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing with these is that it's
best to do it kind of after it's rained,
[SPEAKER_00]: a short period afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you assess all your soils
within a short time frame so the soils
[SPEAKER_00]: don't dry out too much, you can get a
pretty good relative indicator to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I mentioned before, they're
pretty straightforward in how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a pressure gauge on one side,
and this is graduated so there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements on this pole specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you push this down into the soil,
what you're going to see on the top is
[SPEAKER_00]: increased pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only caveat other than moisture on
this is that there's two different tips
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a three-fourths inch tip and a
half inch tip, and you only need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger one if you're working in very
sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is texture, texture by feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than the way that if you
sent soils into the lab that they would
[SPEAKER_00]: look at texture, but there's a number of
resources available that are just flow
[SPEAKER_00]: charts where you can collect a small
amount of your soil with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and you can go through the practice
of assessing those soils and getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: texture simply by feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common field assessment
technique that a lot of farmers or land
[SPEAKER_00]: care practitioners and certainly soil
scientists will develop so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand with the textures of their soil
without going through the full test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the bottom of this slide,
there's also a link available where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can find a texture by feel, but there are
a few out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one that you can look at is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is another indicator that is very easy
to assess on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, we sell pH testing kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in two different ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a wide range as well as a
standard range, your standard range being
[SPEAKER_00]: from pH of 5 to 7.2, and your wider range
being from 4 to 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a single one of these boxes
for $12.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will last you a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty straightforward process of
taking a small amount of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: placing it into these dishes, and then
using the different reagents in a color
[SPEAKER_00]: metric scheme to be able to tell what your
range is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly if you want to do a lot of
sites across your campus, you could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these kits for $12.50 and you'll be
able to do a lot of assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You compare this to the cost of doing the
pH test on its own if you send it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, which is $12 for one test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think you're going to be doing
even testing more than one site,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth it to invest within the pH kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also follow the links on this
PowerPoint to get more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few extra slides here that are
just at the end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first that I want to share with people
is a general workflow of what you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be thinking about if you want to
implement the scoop and dump technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first consideration you want to
think about is whether you have a site
[SPEAKER_00]: that is just top soil is present and it's
just compacted or impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow this workflow and determine
the best, how much compost to apply and at
[SPEAKER_00]: what stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use this technique if you are
on a construction site where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped the top soil and have it
stockpiled somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the scoop and dump technique
on that lower subsoil level to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil quality when you reapply your
top soil at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of work by Susan Day has focused
specifically on this technique of removing
[SPEAKER_00]: top soil and putting it back on along with
the scoop and dump technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the profile rehabilitation,
as she calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last slide is a slide of just some
basic measurements for understanding bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you the equation for finding
the volume of a cylinder, which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple equation and one you need to know
to figure out the specific bulk density of
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, there is some
additional resources and links here to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Horticultural Institute if you'd
like to reach out to me or any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues for further questions or
conversations, as well as the Cornell Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Lab if you'd like to get the test
done or any specific components of the
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab if
you would like to do comprehensive testing
[SPEAKER_00]: of either composts or soils for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I want to thank you all for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please feel free to reach out in the
future if you have questions or would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about the scoop and dump
technique and rehabilitation of urban
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
