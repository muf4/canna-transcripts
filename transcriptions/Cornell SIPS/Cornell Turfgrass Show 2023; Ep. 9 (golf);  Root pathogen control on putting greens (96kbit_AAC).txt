[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a special treat that you can call
bonus content, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus content for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to edit this out, you feel
free to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since we've got Brother Rich here,
we have to start out with his insight on
[SPEAKER_02]: this momentous occasion about to take
place at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you watching on News Channel
10, I'm showing the logo from the 1977
[SPEAKER_02]: concert with the Grateful Dead that was
held here that is considered by
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionados to be among their most finest
performances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rich, you talked about how them
practicing with little feet in advance of
[SPEAKER_02]: this for a while got them good and tight,
something they weren't usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess most people in attendance
didn't notice the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was there just a lot of fewer stone
people here at Cornell or they were really
[SPEAKER_02]: good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, The Dead was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an argument among deadheads
whether Cornell was the best show ever or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was certainly through a period,
1977 might be one of the best years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on your taste in dead music.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were tight and they had a good
repertoire and they were as good as they
[SPEAKER_01]: can get, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might not just be the Cornell show
all of spring 77, even up into a show from
[SPEAKER_01]: here, English town in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, you can listen to
the shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The record store day is this week and
they're putting out May 5th, 77 from
[SPEAKER_01]: Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great show too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, Carl, I'm just going to take it
from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cornell Turfs show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Frank Rossi with my colleague,
Carl Schimenti and our good friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich Buckley, the director of diagnostic
services down there at Rutgers University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just start it out for those of
you watching, not listening, a wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: evening picture from Johnny Paquette down
at Indian Hills on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a beautiful property that Johnny
takes a lot of pride in and love when
[SPEAKER_02]: superintendents have good pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, you know, good BMP in the
morning is a check your irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, this head's sticking on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this superintendent said, well,
you know, wonder why it's sticking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look close, you can see there's a
big old rock in there blocking the road or
[SPEAKER_02]: preventing it from spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a reminder to get out there
and check those heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just turn them on, assuming they're
working, get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now just to, you know, what we used to do
back in the COVID days is remind
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody, you know, as we get going,
there's other people who rely on us many
[SPEAKER_02]: times and also good to take some time and
go see a live show every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Rich?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 175 of them in a good year,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At least every two weeks is necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now looking at the weather, Carl,
here's where I can tell you it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer than normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you didn't need a PhD to find
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 20 degrees above normal in the
Metro New York area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more so than that up in the Rochester
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get out into Western New
York, even in the Adirondacks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about 20 degrees above
normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for those of you that use the
forecast website, you might not have
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed this, but we've got this timeline
above all of our maps now that maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we have it there for pests a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is, you know, what it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see last week it was 11,
14 and 14 degrees above normal here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ithaca area, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's telling me that the next bunch of
days, you can tell, are going to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit cooler or a little bit closer
to normal, right, as we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature departure moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, most are about 10 to 21 days ahead of
normal when you look at growing degree
[SPEAKER_02]: days, the accumulated heat from March 15th
when we try to say this is when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there might have been some
accumulation at the end of February this
[SPEAKER_02]: past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for right now, the data is saying the
season is ahead of normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's other things that are signs
of that, the peak annual bluegrass
[SPEAKER_02]: seedhead flush is now probably prominent
in the metropolitan New York area and
[SPEAKER_02]: south.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're going to find out pretty quick
how your seedhead program worked this year
[SPEAKER_02]: as the seedheads start to come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any stress, particularly drought,
will enhance and amplify the seedhead
[SPEAKER_02]: burst that you get as typical with annual
bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, most have been dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're setting up a little on the dry
side here, quarter inch, except,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich, did you get a bunch of rain last
week?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like some of these areas got
three to four inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get that, did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see three or four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it rained, but I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that is some heavy rain in
northern and central western New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in the last month, right,
you look at the cumulative effect to about
[SPEAKER_02]: where a little bit shorter where we are
now, there's a dry grading in the west and
[SPEAKER_02]: the northwest from Buffalo, Rochester,
the northern part of New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: really on the wet side, 150 to 200% of
normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you get to the southeast,
down towards Long Island to Delmarva,
[SPEAKER_02]: down where you are, Rich, it's been dry
for the last month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, things may be picking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: ET is certainly picking up, but the
drought monitor, and this is the one from
[SPEAKER_02]: last week, we're waiting for the new one
for this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out on Thursday before all of
this comes together, but we're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get measurable dry weather in the
Delmarva, into Philly, Harrisburg,
[SPEAKER_02]: PA, southern Jersey, Hudson Valley,
Orange County, across southeastern
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut, all the way over to Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're starting to set up to
be pretty dry and, you know, it's sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: not getting a signal one way or the other
how much rain we're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a forecast from Art this morning
indicating maybe about an inch,
[SPEAKER_02]: an inch and a half of rain potentially
passing through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of it expected on Sunday this
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry soils means warmer soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we start our conversation with Rich
today, we'll start with thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, first off, one of our early signals
for pathogen control and the kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens that we want to talk about
today, Rich, are these soil temperatures
[SPEAKER_02]: building, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As the soil temperature builds,
the microbial activity in the soil begins
[SPEAKER_02]: to increase, and some of those microbes
like to feed on plant roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's some data from your colleague
at NC State, Lee Butler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lee puts out on his website every year his
samples stuff, when he gets them,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at his 14 year average
compared to 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his data indicates on his bent POA
submissions, he gets them from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the country like you do, in his bent POA
submissions last year, his peak was lower
[SPEAKER_02]: and later than last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought this up because in our
casual conversation, I think this has been
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty consistent with what your season
was like last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had fewer samples and they were later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the conversation that I'm going to
pass it to Carl to talk about is the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer patch and the root pathogen
conversation moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how about this, Rich, would this
characterize your diagnostic sample
[SPEAKER_02]: submissions?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were lower and words was the peak
later last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for us, we were definitely lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down about 30% from the year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in a range that was close to
the level from 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how few we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ours, we had a weird pattern where it
was wet early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we peaked early and then we trailed
off as it dried out in our area in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always think that it's easier to add
water when it's droughty than it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it away when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were kind of wet May, June,
and then we dried out and that's how it
[SPEAKER_01]: was reflected in the sample submission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we Carl venture in, and I pass it to
you, brother, this is a picture that Todd
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowe, he used to be with the USDA in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's with Enview or I'm going to get
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to companies down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still working in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a Bermuda grass tea that these
sections were phrase mold for springs to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the large patch, which I think is a
soil-borne pathogen, is it Rich,
[SPEAKER_02]: large patch?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same as our Brown patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's coming out of the soil,
but it's a foliar patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it survives well in the soil and
it makes sclerotia, but the disease is a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only in the foliage that got phrase
mold did they see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really fascinating phenomenon and
teaches us how little we know about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Carl, let me let you talk about this
wonderful little rant you put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really going to set up Rich for a
lively conversation on root pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I've heard you guys
talk about for a while, Frank,
[SPEAKER_00]: these root pathogens and maybe being more
of a concern up here as the climate is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard you guys talk about this
idea of, you know, so war of attrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about roots,
right, we've got to sort of build this
[SPEAKER_00]: mass of roots early in the year because
whether it's root pathogens, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: heat or drought, you know, nematodes or
something, they're going to get eaten away
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea that you have to build a
solid root system early on, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to help you get through some of
these patch pathogens, even if you're good
[SPEAKER_00]: or not so good at controlling them with
the drenches and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is sort of the ideal root growth when
it comes to soil temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some stuff from James Beard
here in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a cool little three pager church
grass root basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that the optimal root growth
temperatures for our cool season grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: are right around 50 to 65 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, you just showed soil temperatures
in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The southern parts of our region are
getting right into their low fifties now
[SPEAKER_00]: mid fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're creeping into that ideal time to
build the roots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To build for that war of attrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get to 80 degrees ish soil
temperatures, that's when James Beard
[SPEAKER_00]: says, hey, critical root loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're going to start to lose
from sort of abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at the disease cycle and
say, okay, when did the disease is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they start to infect at 1920 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's made the upper sixties right after
our optimal root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they peak fungal growth peaks at 28
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that's low eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right as the root growth is slowing,
the pathogens are coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So James Beard had this little slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sort of drew a little line of ideal
root growth activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I drew a red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of the summer patch pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see for those watching,
that's peaking right when root growth is
[SPEAKER_00]: waning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of war of attrition,
we got to build those roots early on right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find that sort of a nice
balance of not too much, not too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with perphite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think from a lot of superintendents
I've talked to who build good root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, it starts with the irrigation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked with Rick Slattery a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped us build this panel in our
sustainable golf handbook that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: released, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: QR codes on the screen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these little icons up here
that indicate, hey, do this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of the season, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When that root growth is optimal,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's in the spring or the fall,
intentionally allowing some moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see where that wilting point is
early in the year because, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get away from you quick,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we get these plus 10, plus 12
degree days, Frank, it takes a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to that maximum temperature during
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have all that day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got cooler nighttime temps to sort
of buffer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explore where that wilting point is
early in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help push your roots deep,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make this sort of analogy to
athletes where you've got to stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: turf a little bit to build that
resiliency, to build that root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about deep and infrequent
irrigation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So deeper cycles, wetting the soil down
six inches, a little bit past where the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are, maybe even eight inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's data on this from Peter Noden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim and Phu did this down in Maryland,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who can see, there's deep
and infrequent irrigation, basically root
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area there is compared to light
and frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all of these root zone depths,
there's more roots in the deep and
[SPEAKER_00]: infrequent approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think of what I've heard
from superintendents who build those solid
[SPEAKER_00]: root systems, get them through the year,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it starts to sort of give you
some leeway for these root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress in the turf a little bit,
let it dry down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those deep and infrequent cycles
are going to help you build those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: right now to get you through the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is brilliant, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely brilliant to this particular
chart here where you're looking at this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rich, let's start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this when you start to get samples,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've talked about this in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does a little stress in the summer help or
hurt?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little stress in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, does a little stress in the
spring stress or does it help or hurt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's clear it's going to help you
a little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prepping for the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you have good plants and you
have good roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at a sample yesterday and
I'm like, this is summer patch,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I shouldn't see any dead grass here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the root system was already so
troubling that I don't think this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular supertent is going to have
grass by the time it gets to the
[SPEAKER_01]: midsummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know how you recover if
you're already in trouble now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think if you have healthy
grass and you can stress it, and clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: from the data, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't, you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, that's a good question too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mowing stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying, hey, go and mow at 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And roll every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying stress it from the irrigation
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rich was just saying, hey,
last year when the spring was wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we had all that moisture in the
system, when it's tough to take it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, that's when we start to see samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a dry spring, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we get fewer samples in because
we're building that deep root system
[SPEAKER_00]: through basically drought stress,
through moisture stress, not through the
[SPEAKER_00]: hammering it and getting it down to low
heights and rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a distinction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to me, it begs the question
that you're going to get feeding on these
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does more roots help or hurt?
[SPEAKER_02]: The theory is have them more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the war of attrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the season's really long too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about this, Rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting longer periods of infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Carl's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a deeper root system is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not going to just completely
prevent this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start to take this apart a little
bit from a control perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you recommend, instead of spraying
fungicides out of the gate on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as you should, start using
ammonium sulfate, acidifying fertilizers
[SPEAKER_02]: in your nutrient program?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a good first line of defense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's assume you've got plants that will
grow roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because let's assume you don't have plants
that that stress that Carl's talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: sets them up for anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's leave that aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's leave that aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get anthracnose early if you put on
too much stress, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen that already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have seen that already?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have anthracnose samples this week
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early season anthracnose is a
fascinating phenomenon, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is because of what we've learned about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go off.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think that's about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much stress?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on this early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's two things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I think they had it going into the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a proponent of really,
really early season new infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the soil temperatures have to be a
little higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that low temperature threshold for
disease activity is not real well defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's somewhere in the 55,
65 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the samples are coming with the
anthracnose over the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about how we're starting to see
the dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're above average temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's public golf courses that are
getting play all winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got 80 degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got 200 guys out there hitting the
balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have to mow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's getting traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stress already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what's going on in the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's a good qualifier,
Carl, in our case here, that to really
[SPEAKER_02]: call out moisture stress on healthy plants
that didn't start the spring behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: eight ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Rich is talking about here with early
season anthracnose because of traffic
[SPEAKER_02]: stress, mechanical stress, drought stress,
maybe just cold weather and no growth
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're beating these things up,
getting them ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting traffic rich, but they're
not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's 80 degrees one day and it's 55
the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so so, you know, we're growing
for a couple of days and we're not growing
[SPEAKER_01]: for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, but guys are still
golfing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You when it dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you have thought last year you
would have saw more summer patch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an interesting thing because we
were wet in the period of time in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring when the pathogen was starting to
grow.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I saw the slide from Eric
Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric always said that water is the on and
off switch and temperature is the
[SPEAKER_01]: throttle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's if we have wet soils between
the 62 to 80 degree range for soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, you're going to get more
pathogen activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you come to the summer and you
dry out and you're getting that external
[SPEAKER_01]: stress on plants that have a lot of that
are carried in a lot of pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to get more disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year, summer patch was our number
one problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, diagnostic output.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so back back on the summer patch
control train, let's start with ammonium
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it as an early season
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I just just be careful not to push
too much growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because you're going to get top
growth over root growth or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the agronomist side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but, you know, acidifying to the five
and a half range and ammonium sulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like one of the best choices for
that is is a great tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're looking at three inch
tall Kentucky bluegrass, it's almost all
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, so now we're coming into the time
with soil temperatures based on the model
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the Rutgers diagnostic,
the chemical, the thing from Kentucky that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's contributed to that has
efficacy and the different products in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming to a two inch step mid
afternoon at least 65 degrees C for five
[SPEAKER_02]: to 65 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 60
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're coming to that window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich, that window is what peak growth or
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's when it's finally warm
enough to turn the fungus on and get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, the temperature ranges,
you know, they do them in a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow growing at all different
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how fast it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 65 to 82.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in that window where the throttle
is down.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what here's my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because I got a lot of notes in the
last few days, people like it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's warming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it summer patch time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't think the soils are
going yet for summer patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it OK to be early rather than late
with timing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with timing on these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think how long is how much protection do
you get for how long if you had to guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: I well, first of all, you're not going to
get control of a pathogen unless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and it can take up the material,
interact with the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back, Dr. Latten,
you know, in his textbooks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing matters like there's no reason
to put it out, you know, before the fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: is starting to grow, which is why we have
the recommendations for the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, because we know that's when
it's going to start to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So proceeding as close as you can to that
time period, I think you're going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it the biggest dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so getting it down and getting it in
is going to take a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk a lot about the amount of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it with Mike Fidonza last week on
the fairy ring conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to beat this horse dead now
that you got to get enough water on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you the fungus only interacts with the
product when it's starting to infect the
[SPEAKER_02]: root or is the drench designed to really
impact the fungus in the soil and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to punt that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would have some effect,
you know, like a contact, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: would have some effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, you know, you know,
and these materials are like fungal growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a steady source in the plant,
you know, will prevent it from invading
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because we still see the fungus
even in in plants that are healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are getting treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like it's it's killing the
fungus and eradicating the pathogen just
[SPEAKER_01]: stops it from growing for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so Carl's point about the war of
attrition is well taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is basically just you use a
fungicide, let's say you get it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've stunted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope roots can keep growing or
you've got enough because once it's
[SPEAKER_02]: infected early on, it's just going to keep
making its way into that root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deeper and deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or because at some point we used to tell
people, you don't have to treat anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The darn thing is not going to keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's like, are you saying guys
have to drench every two to three weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole year now because of the way this
thing might infect and grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think, well, one, the fungus
doesn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the protection wanes, then then
it's that battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much root system do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we keep the plants alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because I've seen guys on fungicide
programs for 20 years and the
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendent retires, the new guy
doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a storm of problems until they
kind of catch back up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to have regular drenches
to keep that fungus, whatever you can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: like soil pH or manganese additions to the
fertility program or fungicides to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: that fungus from growing any more than it
has to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can start to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the roots growing from an agronomic
standpoint and try to suppress the fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get that balance,
you get through the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, since you brought up the
fungicide thing, we're here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got about five more minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about a problem
that seemed to come up in a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: with our state park golf course
superintendents.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, Frank, we got to use,
you know, you telling us, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: rotate, you're telling us, you know,
use different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have more summer patch
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a lot of combos and rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at this thing, which people can't
see or aren't watching us on news channel
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot of 11 and threes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of 11 freck codes and 11,
a lot of threes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet a lot of guys are not always
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this, am I, should I be worried about
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This seemed like something I wasn't paying
attention to until the superintendent
[SPEAKER_02]: asked me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are singular active ingredients
like a firm or that's for fairy ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't, I got the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the thing off Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in a summer patch and it gave me
sevens and elevens, a three, threes and
[SPEAKER_02]: elevens, almost all threes and elevens on
the mode of action rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do, what do you tell guys when they
use this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something we need to be mindful of
or just get the darn thing controlled?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to get resistant with
summer patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we've never had a situation where we
could confirm that there was a resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I, but I will caution you if you're
using a lot of DMI materials, that dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: spot is an issue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so again, I think that you can use
the, you use the materials, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would definitely, you know,
a couple of DMIs and a couple of strobies
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that thiophane eight methyl
is a pretty darn good summer patch
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you could rotate in
even with the restrictions that we see
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the pike on, on how much you
can use, you know, a shot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a good dollar spot control too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might, you know, help you use a
little bit less DMI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no confirmed resistance of summer patch
organisms to any fungicide program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dollar spot thing is odd because,
you know, you put a DMI on and you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: water it in for summer patch, but a dollar
spot product you leave on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using it for summer patch,
water it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's likely to help a little bit
with dollar spot resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying we'll have enough
thiophane eight methyl, even with the
[SPEAKER_02]: restrictions to get good control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, how, how many times are
you going to use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once, maybe twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, you know, that's the only
other disease where we really like it is
[SPEAKER_01]: gray leaf spot, you know, and,
and so, you know, you save it for a gray
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf spot app in the fall and maybe you do
one for summer patch in the spring and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably still under the,
under the threshold for use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing here is the early season dollar
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a buzz about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DMIs we use also create dollar spot
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember this was tested a number of
times and it looked like things like
[SPEAKER_02]: Iprydione and Vinclausolin might've had
some benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those products are not widely used nor
available as much as they used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like this as a early season
program?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not a fan of early season
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine this isn't something you
necessarily support that it works either
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward and lowering your dollar
spot risk as you get into the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you know, if you're going to use a
DMI for summer patch and you hit in the 65
[SPEAKER_01]: soil temperatures, you know, we've had
that on our turf grass farm around mid
[SPEAKER_01]: May.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mid May 15th, you know, that's about the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, if we, if I think back to all my
time spent with James Hempfling on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the farm, um, he would say 15 March or
May 15th, May 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about when dollar spot always
starts for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you have, so your first
shot of banner or, you know, probe
[SPEAKER_01]: condesol for summer patch is, is right in
line with your dollar spot program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but with dollar spot,
just there's more pressure to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to come back in a
couple of weeks with, with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, you know, one of the SDHI
materials or something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Carl, we weren't lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got bonus content at the beginning
of this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, any burning questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise we'll get rich out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we nailed it right on the head,
Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I've got a whole list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make people can't see this,
but I just make notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned stuff going through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a whole page of notes that I've
got now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was writing down notes about irrigation
and roots at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even, even we learned stuff from this
Frank, it's, it's learning opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: us too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime we're talking, I I'm trying to
absorb something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see you at the Cornell show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, get us out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have rich, rich, wasn't going to be
able to shell out the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody I know has a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody I know has a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you want to pay five
grand for a dead show, I'm going to Los
[SPEAKER_01]: Angeles in the middle of May and my
tickets cost 150 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everyone for joining the Cornell
turf show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back tomorrow with a sports show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but until then everybody enjoyed the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thanks for joining us.
Have a great day.
