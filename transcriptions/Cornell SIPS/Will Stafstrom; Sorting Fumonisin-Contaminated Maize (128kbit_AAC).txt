[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are microtoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly produced by Cucerium
versilioides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a coagulant pathogen that causes
Cucerium irrot in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this irrot produces Cuminicins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in these because these
microtoxins are a health risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more common in tropical and
warm tempered climates such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: southern United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're linked to a variety of health
problems in humans such as esophageal
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, childhood stunting, and also
they're a big issue in livestock,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for pigs and horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA regulates this at a range
depending on the final product of two to
[SPEAKER_00]: four parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: For today's talk I'll be referencing the
two parts per million limit mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you can see an irrot and these
white streaks on the kernels are signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the coagulant pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuminicin V1 is the most common and toxic
form of Cuminicins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the paradigm that we're sort of
working under today is the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucerium irrot colonizes the kernels and
causes the kernels it colonizes to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you decrease density we think that
then that will be linked to an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to mitigate Cuminicins and
their harmful effects is by sorting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of sorting methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be density based such as gravity
table here which is often used for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size based sorting such as screening out
fines which can be more toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also spectral based sorting methods
such as using near correct fluorescence to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect spectral characteristics of the
toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we want to sort?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well a breeder might want a low-cost
phenotyping alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer might want to increase the value
of their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in many parts of the world such
as here in Africa these are a large public
[SPEAKER_00]: health risk and a post-service
intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our lab we've developed with the
help of a local inventor John Fuchs a
[SPEAKER_00]: density based sorting device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this device uses vacuum based density
sorting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't see but up here is a large
fan that has a tube that connects to this
[SPEAKER_00]: hole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's providing suction through this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are two bins at the bottom
left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantages of this compared to
maybe a gravity table is that it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has okay throughput and we can
adjust it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this cartoon of how it
actually functions you drop your unsorted
[SPEAKER_00]: maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drops one by one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A less dense kernel will be more likely to
fold towards the right side and land in
[SPEAKER_00]: your reject bin where there's less dense
kernels which are putatively more toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas denser kernels are like more
likely to stay the left side and land in
[SPEAKER_00]: your reject bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when assessing the efficiency and
effectiveness of your sorting you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts of specificity and sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specificity being the rate of true
negatives, how well you're doing at
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your good kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sensitivity, your rate of true
positives, how well you're doing at
[SPEAKER_00]: rejecting the bad kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to calibrate this device we use 3D
compilers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We printed a plastic maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was started by Julie Wyshedski,
a former master's student in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the top row we had each color
corresponding to a different density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at different sizes,
small, medium, and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different shapes such as a sphere
versus kernel shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't show you all of these results
but it can in fact separate based on
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shape can also play an influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at how well re-sorting
our accepted fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorting once and then sorting this
fraction again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that affects specificity and
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now moving from the plastic to the real
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Texas Smeas that was naturally
infected by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had one kilogram circles that we
re-sorted three times as I described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measured both attributes like 100
kernel weight, both density or test
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, as well as total kimonosins were
measured by Lysen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that our device did a
good job at separating based on these both
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the different fractions and
100 kernel weight was significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see for both density our rejected
fraction was significantly lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura Marwiles, a former graduate student,
showed that there was a correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between both density and kimonosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, because of that,
we were able to show that kimonosins were
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly decreased by 80% in our
accepted fraction when we re-sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rejected fraction had
significantly higher kimonosin levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I should point out that if we're
thinking of this as trying to meet some
[SPEAKER_00]: legal limit of two-fourths of a million,
our accepted fraction still had the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of samples exceeding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to zoom in further to
understand at the single kernel level what
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of traits were affected by this
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also single kernel traits that could
be related to kimonosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took a subset of 72 accepted
kernels and 72 rejected kernels from one
[SPEAKER_00]: sample and measured the mass, which is
very simple, just by placing it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to get the volume, it's a little
more difficult as it's complicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the volume of a small irregular
shaped object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the help of Stephen Stewart in my
course lab, we developed this small device
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes 36 pictures around the kernel
and then using code from a GERI group,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is volume carving, to make a 3D
reconstruction of the kernel that gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you a value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also interested in the visual
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I scored these kernels based on
their symptoms, one being asymptomatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to four being highly
symptomatic, finally measuring all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kimonosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each single kernel violates them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll be showing you some histograms
of each single kernel characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in single kernel mass, we have a
significant decrease where the dashed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines are the means of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our rejected fraction mean was
significantly lower than accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of mass, however, I want to point
out that there's a lot of overlap between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar for volume, there was a
significant decrease in the rejected
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rejected fraction kernels tended to be
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, there's a lot of overlap
between two distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you just divide mass by
volume to find density, we found no
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference between the density
of the kernels in each fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little puzzling based on the theory
of our shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I want to point out that the
distributions here are much narrower than
[SPEAKER_00]: they were for mass and volume,
making it more difficult for a sorter to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate based on this characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we look at actual kimonosin
in our single kernel set, the transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: kimonosin values are significantly lower
in our accepted kernels, which is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to point out that the most
toxic kernels that will order some
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude higher than this two parts per
million limit were most concentrated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rejected fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see we did have some false
negatives sneaking in through our accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I now want to look at how each of these
traits correlated to log-transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: kimonosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you direct your attention to the
right-hand column, you can see that for
[SPEAKER_00]: each characteristic there was significant
but only slightly negative correlations
[SPEAKER_00]: with log-transformed kimonosin,
indicating that single kernels with higher
[SPEAKER_00]: kimonosin tended to be lighter,
smaller, and less dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally wanted to look at,
based on the single kernel data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well we were doing with the sorting
based on specificity and sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a drop sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We predict accepted was our accepted bid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found true negatives of 94%,
false negatives 6% were those few that we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw just exceeding the limit in the
histogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we look at our sensitivity,
it's much lower, 13%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means when we're sorting,
we're getting a lot of those, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: misidentifying a lot of non-toxic kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having a lot of false positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to compare this to how just your
eyeballs would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on that visual scoring,
classifying one to two visual score as
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted, and three to four visual scores
rejected, we had similar effectiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing our machine to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably the machine is much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have 95% specificity and 70%
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does indicate that visual
characteristics of the maze is important
[SPEAKER_00]: for understanding kimonosin contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all that being said, I'm working to
integrate these tools with other sorting
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, such as visual mirror infrared
reflectance on the single kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also interested in using these tools
on mirror isogenic lines we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking of ways to use the drops for
rich samples of toxic kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using various tools to measure single
kernel attributes and see how those relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to zero resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all that being said, I'd like to
thank everyone in the Nelson lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the wonderful collaborators who
helped make this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Funday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome any questions.
