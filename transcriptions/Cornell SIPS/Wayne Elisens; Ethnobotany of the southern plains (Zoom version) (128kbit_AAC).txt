[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so my training is as a plant
systematist, and I'm speaking on
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I will just preface this talk
saying I have some credentials in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ethno part of this, since I have an
undergraduate degree in anthropology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I crossed over through ethnobotany,
and to botany became totally confused by
[SPEAKER_04]: all the plant names and made a career out
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And later in my career, I had some
opportunities being in Oklahoma and
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborating with paleoethnobotanists and
other ethnobotanists to do some research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of serendipity in
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really like this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very different than other things
I've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it has some merit,
and you can be the judge of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really focusing on three tribes,
which I'll make a case for as being a good
[SPEAKER_04]: window to look at an overall view of
ethnobotany of the southern plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to reconstruct,
in many respects, traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a difficult task.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with each generation, more and more
information gets lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very challenging in many respects.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, just to start off at a general level,
ethnobotany defined is just interactions
[SPEAKER_04]: between cultures and people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants and people, however you want to
define it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Richard Schultes, a lot of you should
be familiar with that name, is often
[SPEAKER_04]: called the father of modern ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is an Oklahoma connection if
you're familiar with Schultes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is my shout out to undergrads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Schultes on the end, if I can't see
where this thing is.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, he's on your left.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the end of his junior year going
into his senior year at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did a three months senior thesis
research with an anthropologist in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oklahoma, where he spent time with the
Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, nobody had made any kind
of inventory of plants used by the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they were buffalo hunters.
[SPEAKER_04]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a lot more complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, obviously, that led into an
incredible career as somebody who
[SPEAKER_04]: basically defined the field of
ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_04]: He spent 12 years in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're more interested in following up
on this, the classic book by Wade Davis,
[SPEAKER_04]: One River, is a good depiction of that
time spent based on his journals.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of his photographs are in the book
called The Lost Amazon, also put together
[SPEAKER_04]: by Wade Davis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a movie, just the only
cinematic portrait trail of Schultes that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm aware of, Embrace of the Serpent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a film from Columbia, nominated for
Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a very interesting individual and
really significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so let's get back into the Southern
Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in the Southern Plains here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's click my heels together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, eco-geographical setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shaded area, from an eco-region
perspective, this is South Central
[SPEAKER_04]: Semi-Arid Prairie ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geographers often have a cut-off of the
Central Great Plains and the Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm mostly concerned with the Southern
Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see, basically, where the
Plains, Apache, the Kiowa, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Comanche fit in that geographic and
eco-geographical scheme.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to be particularly
significant, unlike many of the tribes
[SPEAKER_04]: represented in Oklahoma, the KCA,
as they are often referred to,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, this was
their native territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they shrunk their territory,
and other major changes happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they weren't transported in here like
the Cherokee and other southeastern
[SPEAKER_04]: tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so let's look at the cultural
landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we have here is a little map.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tribes in red were basically
nomadic hunting and gathering tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they hunted bison.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they did more than hunt bison.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gathered plant materials and other
natural resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: The agrarian hunting economies are in
blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, in the Southern Plains,
it was really a Kiowa, a Comanche,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see a hatched area taking in
the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas was
[SPEAKER_04]: their original reservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's much too large.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two years later, they shrunk to rez.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had the small area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then 1901, they basically eliminated
the reservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of our early images are by George
Catlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see an image of Comanche bison
hunting there, as well as a Kiowa
[SPEAKER_04]: encampment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I maintain, and that's my thesis at the
KCA, that they are an ideal group to study
[SPEAKER_04]: the Southern Plains ethnobotany for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been geographically contiguous,
really, for a couple hundred years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a similar economic base,
which was basically hunting and gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a close association since your
American contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually confederated politically
under the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a cultural, eco-geographic,
and economic strategies, they were very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was much intermarriage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, these were very disparate tribes
linguistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to put these in a linguistic context,
each of those tribes, their language is in
[SPEAKER_04]: a different language family.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did they communicate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, many peoples living in
different parts of the world learn
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple languages, unlike Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is part of their growing up,
because they have to interact with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also use sign language quite a bit,
which came in very useful on one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: field trips when I was with a 96-year-old
Apache elder who had no hearing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and his son communicated by sign language.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a shared cultural heritage.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1700, the Plains Apache were closely
allied with the Kiowa, which they've kept
[SPEAKER_04]: up all these years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where a lot of the intermarriage
was particular between the Kiowa and
[SPEAKER_04]: Apache.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, for decades, the Apache weren't
even known about.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just assumed to be some group of
Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they called them the Kiowa
Apache, more correctly referred to as the
[SPEAKER_04]: Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a dialect different from some of the
other Apache groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1806, the Kiowa and Comanche made peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1885, they were actually forced to settle.
[SPEAKER_04]: A familiar story in American Indian
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1867, they became confederated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was like, there's another
tribe in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it became a KCA reservation and kind of
a KC.
[SPEAKER_04]: By 1886, the American bison was
functionally extirpated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is significant, because by being
restricted and being basically forced to
[SPEAKER_04]: become ranchers or farmers, which they
were not, their economic base evaporated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one way to destroy a culture is
to destroy its economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dawes Act was enacted later,
which eliminated a lot of communal lands,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means families were given individual
plots, which left a lot of leftover land,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was then open for settlement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reservation dissolved in 1901.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are very, very significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if you talk to any of these
groups, I'm not doing it justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just going over in such a short period
of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so let's look at the reservation area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's in red the outline of the
reservation, which they were in until
[SPEAKER_04]: 1901.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where most of the tribal
peoples that haven't relocated actually
[SPEAKER_04]: are today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where tribal headquarters are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were forced to settle on the
reservation, home territory restricted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were restricted to family allotments,
so a dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly when they weren't farmers or
ranchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no bison, and it's a very sad
point in their history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very proud people have to fight for scraps
thrown off the back of a wagon,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And traditional knowledge, of course,
lost in every generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: A familiar, familiar story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at the objectives of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really more of a meta-analysis,
where I've taken data and then tried to
[SPEAKER_04]: assemble it, and then do different
analyses with the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the raw data are plantless
use of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to reconstruct their floristic
and ethnobotanical resources to get that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of baseline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at their use patterns in a floristic
context and in an ethnobotanical context.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how many plants did they use?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what percentage of the floor?
[SPEAKER_04]: How does this compare to other groups?
[SPEAKER_04]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And test the hypotheses on recorded versus
potential, economic plant resources,
[SPEAKER_04]: underreporting of economic plant use,
and loss of traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are difficult things to get at,
but it's something that anthropologists,
[SPEAKER_04]: social sciences, and ethnobotanists have
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, in some respects, we're
reconstructing things in scientific
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to get data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we try and make inferences that
are consistent with that data and propose
[SPEAKER_04]: hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, the methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compiling the economic plant data from the
few surveys that are out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: from some direct communication with some
of the tribal members, and other scattered
[SPEAKER_04]: sources in the literature, sometimes
almost anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the trouble with any
meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have different kinds of data,
and you kind of have to standardize it and
[SPEAKER_04]: bring it in and try and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reconstruct floors for the south central
prairie ecoregion, as well as for their
[SPEAKER_04]: reservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of this relied very heavily on
the databases listed at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't underestimate the value of
some of these databases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's invaluable if I could not do this
kind of work otherwise, as most people who
[SPEAKER_04]: use databases and those resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Native American ethnobotany database,
in particular, was very useful for looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at tribal and plant resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, now I was fortunate, and this also
kind of initiated the study, in that there
[SPEAKER_04]: were three important surveys of this
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: In particular, the Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice Judy Jordan published a book
in 2008.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was instrumental in working with
her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She had done her work in the early 1960s,
three summers of intensive field work,
[SPEAKER_04]: and was granted a master's degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her master's thesis was signed out by
people all over the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this woman did not get a PhD?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sad story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, and she lived less than a mile
from where I lived.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked her up.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got her notes together, and she
published it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was very pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's Schulte's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: So three months, going into his senior
year, ended up with a critical
[SPEAKER_04]: publication, and really the best summary
of the plant used by the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Comanche, a group out of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a Michigan archaeological summer
station there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boney Jones was the botanist, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those vouchers are at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Schulte's ones are at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Judy Jordan's are at Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get into some of the summary of
the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was able to pull these data and
quantify it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at the Kiowa, we can see and
verify about 88 species were recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Comanche is much less, 68.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I spent more time looking through
the Michigan vouchers, which were actually
[SPEAKER_04]: not in the Michigan herbarium,
but were in the anthropological
[SPEAKER_04]: collections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily, I was able to identify some
of the vouchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the vouchers were fragments of
wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did not identify some of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Plains Apache, which actually took
place over three years, had a much greater
[SPEAKER_04]: number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some lessons there in terms of
field work, in terms of informants,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Judy had multiple informants, male and
female, over multiple summers from
[SPEAKER_04]: different family groups, as opposed to one
or two male informants during a three
[SPEAKER_04]: month period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at the totals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to look at the species present
in at least one tribe, about 175.
[SPEAKER_04]: And species recorded for use among all
tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have three ethnobotanical surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 17 of those are reported in all three
tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of these data only appear in one
survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of these are native to the Southern
Plains, 94%, 164.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five were native to North America,
but are found outside the region.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're mostly through trading.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were significant plants from the
South.
[SPEAKER_04]: South or West mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were also some exotic species,
not native, six species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like this graphic, and other
individuals have as well, because I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it visually portrays the effect of an
obviously related group that shared a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of the same knowledge of the resources and
how little overlap there was from
[SPEAKER_04]: independent research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Researchers doing these surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the number of species for the
Kiowa, the Apache, and Comanche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the 17 that were shared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see some are shared
between the Apache and the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are in surveys in the Comanche and
Kiowa, and then 35 between the Apache.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by portraying it this way, you realize
that a lot of the information really just
[SPEAKER_04]: surfaced in one ethnobotanical survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means a lot of that information,
which was probably there, was forgotten by
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the informants, or was not
recorded, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's proprietary in the case of
healing plants, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look by category.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of things you can do once
you get these kind of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are species used in at least one
tribe out of the 175.
[SPEAKER_04]: A large portion of that are edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the major supplement to the
protein source being primarily ice and
[SPEAKER_04]: meat, not exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ritual or medicinal plants, also a major,
major category.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not surprising.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is through most ethnobotanical
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: A large number, again, used for material
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is quite important as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personal care and adornment, it drops off
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you might suspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the many plants had multiple
uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: A component or a different plant part
could be used medicinally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it could be used materially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So edible plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this category, I'm keeping it with
broad strokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have foodstuffs, beverages,
masticatories, additives, 91 species.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these have underground parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another major proportion, more than half,
used reproductive parts, fruits,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, and 20 species, sap, stems,
leaves, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two common ones, which you're familiar
with as well here, would be rhus glabra,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is widespread, and nufar lutia as
well, which is widespread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Material culture is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't think it is, see.
[SPEAKER_04]: How well you survive out there without not
just your iPhone, everything else that we
[SPEAKER_04]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Construction materials, dyes, fibers,
resins, miscellaneous products.
[SPEAKER_04]: A major, major category.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fibers, yucca glauca, which is also
multiple use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of that was edible as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The young stems, which are kind of like
asparagus, as well as the blossoms,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fibers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a roughly dogwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is common in that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which often produces a lot of stems from a
crown that are equal diameter,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they make good arrow shifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ritual medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these are quite well known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Used such as echinacea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Widely, widely used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just in this region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peyote's been in use for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, the Comanche were part of
the KCA, and they were really widespread.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Nacay was too, but the Comanche
roamed all over from Mexico up to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of what they did is take boat
wood and other things, and they would
[SPEAKER_04]: trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got exposed to Peyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduced it in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Oklahoma-based tribes, the KCA,
as well as the Cheyenne and Arapaho,
[SPEAKER_04]: were very critical in introducing Peyote
and in development of the Native American
[SPEAKER_04]: church.
[SPEAKER_04]: White sagebrush, which is also well known
here, is widely used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personal adornment, personal care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so many species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monardifistulosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a mint, a member of the Lamiaceae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commonly used as a perfume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those hot Southern Plains summers of
perfume could be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk through this, it's very,
very aromatic with lots of volatile
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Escalbine.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually a psychoactive plant,
but a particularly dangerous plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a legume.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see a low mint there, like a
peanut.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are very toxic, and it's very
difficult to modulate the amount taken
[SPEAKER_04]: without it being catastrophic,
kind of like gypsum weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cytodes grama budelua.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting in the sense that the
secund or the inflorescences on one side
[SPEAKER_04]: of the stem look very similar to warlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very common as an ornament,
particularly in ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these had multiple uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of the most common ones would be
cacti, opryntia, which are abundant in
[SPEAKER_04]: this region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edible, material culture, ritual
medicinal, as well as black walnut,
[SPEAKER_04]: plenty of black walnuts here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another species of walnut,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small fruited walnut, microcarpa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edible material, culture, ritual
medicinal, multiple uses for these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to go through a couple of
plants, and then we'll look at the data
[SPEAKER_04]: from a couple of different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the representative plants,
the junipers and Juniperus virginiana,
[SPEAKER_04]: people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the structural material for a lot
of tipis and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get away from the rockies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have lodgepole pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence the name lodgepole.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use cedars.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a western cedar on limestone
that pops up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm particularly pleased with this one
because I found this out by really talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to a couple of the elders in the Apache,
and they took me to a spot where they had
[SPEAKER_04]: a different cedar with a different smoke,
obviously a different terpenoid
[SPEAKER_04]: composition, and a different colored
fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went there, and as soon as I saw it,
I knew it was pinchotii.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were able to actually add that to
the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was on a sacred mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I felt very privileged.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went there with the 96-year-old ex-chair
of the tribal council who couldn't climb
[SPEAKER_04]: the hill, but he wanted to see it one last
time because he only lived three months
[SPEAKER_04]: after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was the last native speaker for
that dialect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the museum at the University of
Oklahoma has a very active program of
[SPEAKER_04]: recording languages and stories by native
speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's quite an audio library for
that Plains Apache dialect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because his son, who I knew, knew so songs
and knew some plants, but had no idea what
[SPEAKER_04]: the songs meant or what the plants were
used for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good example of just one
generation loss of traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowdark, or if you're from Texas,
Bowdark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Osage Orange is a member of the Moreci and
Mulberry family.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the preferred wood for bows,
particularly a mixture of the heartwood
[SPEAKER_04]: with the sapwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: That interface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you split the wood radially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the preferred whole wood
throughout the Plains region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Walnuts, little one black, the microcarpa,
as well as nigra jugulans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And very widely used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they appreciated its beauty as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is arguably one of the most beautiful
native North American woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a Kiowa cradle board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite spectacular as well as being
functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: White sagebrush, very, very well known,
including in this region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Artemisia lutea viciana.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a plant's database map.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you don't have it if you're up in
Alaska, but other than that, widely,
[SPEAKER_04]: widely used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess Alabama people are missing out
on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't comment on that further.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, Indian breadroot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show a very, very critical plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still fairly abundant in the Northern
Plains, so a lot of the Sioux have these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and include them in their
ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's getting much more difficult to
find in the Southern Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very important edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are six plants not native to
North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wormwood, dandelion, watercress,
sweet clover, Johnson grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, they were used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when plants became introduced and the
native peoples found them, if they knew of
[SPEAKER_04]: the use, that knowledge spread and they
incorporated into their repertoire.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know a lot of these have been around
a long period of time, so they were
[SPEAKER_04]: significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these plants used by the KCA were
also used outside of the Southern Plains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually, it depends on the natural
distribution of the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the KCA plants are going to be
plants found in the North American prairie
[SPEAKER_04]: and the southwestern or Sonoran floristic
provinces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Yucca glauca, as you can see,
which is mostly mid-continent,
[SPEAKER_04]: has a mid-continent tribal use pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western soapberry, much more southwestern.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pick up the pop go, as well as the
KCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ruse claybird is used by a multitude
of tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reflecting its distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if we look at the archaeological
record, and a lot of these records come
[SPEAKER_04]: from the flotation method.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these are charcoalified.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have 75 plants from the Great Plains
in the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those who may not be familiar,
it's generally divided into the
[SPEAKER_04]: Paleoindian, basically 10,000 years and
older, the Archaic period, till about
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 BCE, Woodland, and then the Plains
village, urging into the modern.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's your scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we look at some of the KCA species
that are in the archaeological record,
[SPEAKER_04]: most of this data, these data are by genus
only.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult to identify a lot of
species that are charcoalified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 47 appear in the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we go back in time, Plains village,
Woodland, Archaic, Paleo, we can see you
[SPEAKER_04]: drop off the number of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's five plants still used that
have been in use for much greater than
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that's interesting is
there's several species in the record that
[SPEAKER_04]: don't show up in the KCA record.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at goosefoot, Kenopodium,
that is a KCA plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carbonized and sumpweed in the sunflower
family, Iba annua, very widespread
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout its range historically in the
Paleoethnobotanical record.
[SPEAKER_04]: No record for the KCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's true for many cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that once corn came in,
they dropped a lot of these grains that
[SPEAKER_04]: were more like famine foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the five plants that have a
greater than 10,000 year record,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I find pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Goosefoot, chokecherry, sorrelse,
which you may not be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_04]: member of the mallow family, sunflower,
as well as apuentia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we summarize the botany in an
ethnographic context, we'll see that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a wide variety of plants used.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot more than just bison,
monolithic bison hunters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the plants are used by other
tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a lot of communication,
shared knowledge, which has good survival
[SPEAKER_04]: value.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes perfect sociological sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a long history of usage for many
of these plants, thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the region, even with the ebb and flow
of different cultural groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm proposing that the combined data
particularly given the nature of
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnobotanical surveys resulted in a much
more complete view of the plants used by
[SPEAKER_04]: the individual tribes and probably is a
more accurate reflection of their
[SPEAKER_04]: collective knowledge base of plant
resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, once you get this,
there's a lot of other questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many plants did they use?
[SPEAKER_04]: How thorough are some of these surveys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of partially answered that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real tricky one, how can we estimate
loss of traditional knowledge other than
[SPEAKER_04]: saying traditional knowledge is lost in
each generation, which it obviously is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's difficult to kind of quantify
some of these or get a more robust
[SPEAKER_04]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I reconstructed the floor of the
KCA-RES.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where the databases come in and
came up with 12 hundred and 89 species for
[SPEAKER_04]: this seven county region in southwestern
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was mostly concerned with the natives,
so that's a fair number.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also went in, which was a lot more
challenging, and tried to reconstruct the
[SPEAKER_04]: native floor of the southern south central
Great Plains ecoregion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that floor of the Great Plains was
of limited use because of the region that
[SPEAKER_04]: it covers and incorporates the northern
plains as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I came up with 28 and 39 native species
there, 12 89 native species for the RES.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then looking at those reservation
plants with economic uses elsewhere in
[SPEAKER_04]: North America, 508 are recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So almost two out of five plants on that
reservation had some documented history of
[SPEAKER_04]: use by Native Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two out of five.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of grass species in
there, a lot of legume species,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of asteracea species.
[SPEAKER_04]: But two out of five were useful,
and that's pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, not all of those were used,
but that's the potential resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the south central plains,
you see a much smaller percentage,
[SPEAKER_04]: about 6%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure the numbers were much larger,
but with their range restriction,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of that extra reservation floor was
probably forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they used 164 native plants that I can
document out of 12 89.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 12.7%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's the figure that's actually
very similar to well-documented
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnobotanical surveys elsewhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's hard to get that kind of data
because of the tribal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever group you're studying is part of
a larger region, and they don't just have
[SPEAKER_04]: a floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The closest example would be a Pacific
island.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a discrete floor and a discrete
culture, and you can look at a percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: of that floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're getting pretty close to what
other people have recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, there's only one third of the
plants, 164 out of 508, that are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: used or at least recorded for use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, potential economic species,
almost 40%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actual, if we combine the data from KCA,
you see we get a 12.7%, which actually
[SPEAKER_04]: most ethnobotanists feel comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we just look at individual surveys,
you can see the numbers, they're much
[SPEAKER_04]: reduced, 6.4, 4.7, 7.8.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the close ties, again,
going back to my original argument,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're getting closer to having an
accurate reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the ethnobotanical base.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting to the summaries, key points of
the use patterns, about 12.7%,
[SPEAKER_04]: almost 13%.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually very similar to the floor
of South Africa totals, where they've
[SPEAKER_04]: looked at how many plants were used based
on the floor as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, there's many, many
different regions in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the RSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have, people have, they sound like
Donald Trump up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking to ethnobotanists who have done
field work, somewhere around 10% is often
[SPEAKER_04]: a number that they come up with,
in terms of a ballpark percentage of the
[SPEAKER_04]: floor that's actually used.
[SPEAKER_04]: But only one third of the native plants,
the potential useful plants, were actually
[SPEAKER_04]: used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 40% of those have been used by some
groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting to the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of evidence do we have for loss
of traditional knowledge?
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we do the best we can with
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low usage of economic plants within the
floor of their historic range.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other factors complicating
these, but that's certainly a contributing
[SPEAKER_04]: factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 30% of the species recorded for use
of potential plants are actually used.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's most undoubtedly an underestimate
what we're coming up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, like in any culture,
transcultural dispersal of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_04]: resource use is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at the spread of corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need an example, 30% of the exotic
floor is used economically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then many KCA plants were widely used
among other tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was obviously much communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Melalotis, a widely used exotic yellow
sweet clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second conclusion slide, evidence for
underreporting of ethnobotanical data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this may be some of the more
significant results of interest
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnobotanies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get very low numbers on these
individual surveys compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: comparators.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we pull it, we actually get a
much more reasonable number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's definite underreporting
in some of these surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limited overlap among tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gets into ethnographic sampling
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't go in and talk to one
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if you were interviewed and say,
tell me everything about America.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get a very biased and
minimalist subset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, many regional economic species
listed are not recorded, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I almost end here with this picture of
Schultes again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a shout out to you,
undergrads.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know where your undergraduate
projects are going to take you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear Schultes signed up for a summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can write my senior thesis on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was doing this his entire career,
and it really changed the landscape of
[SPEAKER_04]: science in several disciplines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there he was probably 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the morning after a peyote ritual.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice he still has his tie on.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been described as patrician.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't wear a tie on the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: For acknowledgments, certainly I want to
acknowledge the KCA tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their knowledge and the interactions
I've had with them and some of their
[SPEAKER_04]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been very happy to see this data
resurrected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Judy Jordan, who wrote that book,
has actually been given an honorific title
[SPEAKER_04]: within the Plains Apache tribe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she brought plants to their attention
that they forgot about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way back there in the cultural
knowledge somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will McClatchy used to be in Hawaii,
then Brit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he's independent in the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Helped quite a bit with some of my
floristic ethnobotanical analyses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some colleagues at Oklahoma, Paul Minnis,
a paleoethnobotanist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he likes his plants charcoalified.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume that's not true for the Hort
department.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple of grad students.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan Moorman, who put together that
incredible database, has been very
[SPEAKER_04]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's retired now, but he still keeps the
database active.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint Flannery, who oversees the Anthro
Collections at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these people were very helpful in
putting this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and I'd be happy to answer some
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one, Wayne.
[SPEAKER_03]: What evidence is there of any of these
tribes cultivating any of these plants as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to simply gathering them from the
wild?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, many times there is the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was about, were any of
these wild plants actually cultivated?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they were mobile people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, and so they really
took careful stock of their resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes they almost followed a
route.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of knew where some of the plants
were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very possible they did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, if we look at some examples,
it's very common in some cultures for
[SPEAKER_04]: people, particularly like who aren't
theirs or whatever, to transplant plants
[SPEAKER_04]: into a medicinal garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of that may have happened,
particularly if there was a route in their
[SPEAKER_04]: cyclic mobility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they could come back and do where
certain plants were.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's likely, but we have no direct
evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been a real issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: With something like sumpweed, which is
really widespread in the archaeological
[SPEAKER_04]: record.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not reported among many extant
tribes at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they just dropped it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it appears in such numbers in the
archaeological record to make it seem like
[SPEAKER_04]: they were actually, it was like an
incipient cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, individuals are actually trying
to redevelop sumpweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not eaten it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't have any direct evidence of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to ethnobotanical surveys,
did any of the researchers, including
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself, look at cultural work,
such as creation stories for mentions of
[SPEAKER_01]: significant plants, or the actual
instructions for how to use these plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is about whether
researchers have also looked in the like
[SPEAKER_04]: creation stories that would incorporate
some of these significant plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have not directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several good ethnographic books
and investigations of the KCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have not come across that in some of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to peruse a lot of that
literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these, even if they're
referenced in the native language,
[SPEAKER_04]: that language has at least an English
equivalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd have to ask some of my
anthropological colleagues for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a member of the Kiowa
tribe on the OU anthropology faculty,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: They teach Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can do your language
requirement learning Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not aware of any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wayne, if you look across the range from
the plants that are best known to show up
[SPEAKER_01]: in most surveys on down to the ones that
you have the fewest records for,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that an axis about the commonality of
the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are certain types of uses more likely
to be showing up in more lists?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was plants that are
commonly recurring, whether it reflects
[SPEAKER_04]: more that they're very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they have a culturally significant use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer seems to be more towards the
significant component.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of plants that may
be part of the knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they may be less desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like food.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be preferred food,
less preferred food, and then famine food.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nevertheless, the plants that really,
I mean, there's like a dirt a dozen many
[SPEAKER_04]: times that just keep appearing in all
these surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they are so critically
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And corcus is one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in the peyote ceremony,
they use corcus leaves, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Patsy, you mentioned that the KC-A tribes
were in three different linguistic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was probably a lot of exchange
of knowledge on usage of particular
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if the nomenclature,
the taxonomy, or the names that they refer
[SPEAKER_00]: to those plants got transferred from
culture to culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could come up with a timeline
of did the Comanche tribe use this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: first?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that name got passed along to the
Apache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any cases like that where you
could make inferences?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is about some of the
naming used by the different tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly given the fact that they
speak languages in three different
[SPEAKER_04]: families.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I have not looked into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the way I approach this topic,
as you might guess, is as a botanist doing
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnobotany as opposed to an ethnographer
doing ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have not looked into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have the names.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are experts and even tribal
members that are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_04]: language that one could test that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be very interesting to look
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, I have not pursued that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have time for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Geneva have questions?
Bill?
Yes.
Yeah.
How many families are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that among these plants that they
commonly, not only commonly, but entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't include that kind of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not on this talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to go into my data archive in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a large number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my primary database is all organized
taxonomically by family.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's at least 65 families.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that may be an underestimate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, things like Roseaceae are very
common.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things like Fabaceae are very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are no seeds, like new seeds,
that were used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there weren't any grass seeds that I
recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I expect a drop seed, Sporopolis,
or something like that to pop up as
[SPEAKER_04]: they've appeared in other surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think those are areas where some
knowledge has been lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, would there be more sharing of
genera among the Greek tribes and of
[SPEAKER_02]: species?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of my numbers are going down to
the species level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes, it depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because different species are often
referred to as a cousin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a cousin of another prunus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is some information that there's
a little bit of error in that data,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sense that they often did not
discriminate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the genus, and that's an interesting
point that you alluded to or directly
[SPEAKER_04]: alluded to.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genus is actually a very, very
critical element in a lot of non-Western
[SPEAKER_04]: taxonomies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But depending on the plant, this species
can be important as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank Professor Ellison for a
fascinating presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
