[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Adrian has mentioned, my original
interest and motivation was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling of plants for, sorry,
can we have this spotlight out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the point was to model plants for
visual purposes, so let's say to create
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes such as this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, have it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's lots of images which
are quite dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was, well, how to
generate this kind of scenery easily?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turned out that the best way is to
actually try to simulate the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: processes of plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how I cross from computer
graphics to developmental biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big question is, how patterns and
forms emerge in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: development?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually pretty much a
fundamental question of developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I would like to focus on a
problem which we were trying to address
[SPEAKER_00]: most recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how do forms of leaves emerge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a problem which is
particularly interesting because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: huge diversity of leaf forms in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, even though for us, the
difference between compound and simply
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves is such a fundamental one,
it plays, for example, a huge role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin with, the question is,
is it simple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that it is also a very labile
feature of leaf form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, well, often,
even within a single plant, we may observe
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves of very different forms,
such as in this case in the flame tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are leaves which are picked from
the same tree and kind of seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: located there without any rhyme or reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are multi-lobed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, there is no gradient to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another example in the silver
ragwort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over there, well, some early leaves
tend to be simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the later ones are, well, very,
very dissected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, a plant can produce this
diversity quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, well, can we
comprehend where the diversity comes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So although this would be a much more kind
of nicer plant to work with if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand with the progression from
simple to compound leaves, but well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that anything is known about
genetics of silver ragwort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started from a plant about which
something is known, namely Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, so Arabidopsis is not at all the
best plant for this because the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: simple, but they have some serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, well, can we
understand where these serrations come
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, well, I put it up with Miltos
Ciantis, then that's for now at Max Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute in Cologne, in trying to figure
out what is the mechanism of patterning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several things came to picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most important is that the
serrations correspond with the convergence
[SPEAKER_00]: points of pin polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here margin of the leaf and
pin proteins, which are pumping oxen,
[SPEAKER_00]: are polarized in such a way that they
converge in the place, which coincides
[SPEAKER_00]: with the location of a convergence point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you are going to see on
other slides or many slides either letter
[SPEAKER_00]: O or P. O is observation, and P is what we
postulate on the basis of observations as
[SPEAKER_00]: the basis of model construction,
which is supposed to elucidate what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serrations are coinciding with this
convergence point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transport of oxen is very
important because if it is impaired by
[SPEAKER_00]: NPA, we have this kind of leaf margin
without serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we lose this formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formation of convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appeared that the key to the
understanding of a serration formation is
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding of the action of oxen
and how oxen-driven patterning happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How and where do the convergence points
emerge?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created a model in which I am going
to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this model, a cell is represented
as a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxen concentration is a green square
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluxes of oxen are represented as white
lines or arrows to show direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wider the line, the bigger the flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pin concentrations are shown as bars
shown in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wider the bar, the higher the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2006, my student, Albert Smith,
and also Henning Jonsson, who was then a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc working at the University of
California Irvine in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Caltech, came up with the same idea of
polarization, which is pins which are
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters of oxen are, well,
as observed, localized in a polar way to
[SPEAKER_00]: some membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of part of interaction
between oxen and pins was basically by
[SPEAKER_00]: then quite well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they postulated that pins are
orienting themselves towards neighboring
[SPEAKER_00]: cell with the highest concentration of
oxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more oxen we have, the more pins
are we going to have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, first, can this kind
of fusion feedback create a pattern?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a simulation which is
illustrating this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a chain of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this interaction in,
well, this feedback in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it results in the formation of
convergence point and, well, oxen maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this happens on a longer distance,
then we obtain a pattern of approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: equally spaced convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this provides a mechanism for creating
a number of convergence points in the
[SPEAKER_00]: margin of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I proceed there, I wanted to
dwell a little bit on this model of
[SPEAKER_00]: polarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model of polarization which was
proposed by Smith and Johnson was,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense, non-physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because it was assuming that a cell
knows what is the concentration of oxen in
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, this violates the principle of
locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like, well, guessing what
if another cell has insight without
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a mechanism how it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was an open question, how actually
it may happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, recently, my post-doc Mik
Cieslak and another PhD student,
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Ranion, came up with the idea,
which is illustrated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually not invalidating this
mechanism of polarizing towards the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: with highest oxygen concentration,
but it provides a possible mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to separate efflux and
influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are already separated because
they are separate efflux carriers and
[SPEAKER_00]: influx carriers in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving one more step, we assume that
the cell can measure efflux and influx
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually possible to come up
with, well, actually too many plausible
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical mechanisms for measuring
unidirectional fluxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it turns out that if you assume
that, well, on one hand, you assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this presence of oxen efflux
promoting pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of all theories of oxygen
polarization going back to Sachs'
[SPEAKER_00]: canalization theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you assume that the influx has opposite
effect, then you have pure canalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: the style of Sachs, which results in
coordinated polarization of all pins in
[SPEAKER_00]: one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is good for creating long
coordinated files of cells like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of Venetian.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, however, we change the sign,
and influx also polarizes pins here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so whether oxygen flows this way or
whether it flows that way, it both has the
[SPEAKER_00]: same effect of promoting polarization of
oxygen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are getting convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this provides a plausible mechanism in
which a cell does not have to look into
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens in a different cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just checks what are unidirectional
fluxes out and in and makes the serum out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, well, it can be shown that this
change of sign here can be accomplished in
[SPEAKER_00]: a quite simple biochemical network by
changing the rate of a single reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would explain why so often we see
changes of polarization from one to
[SPEAKER_00]: another type.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one way or another, we have a
mechanism for forming convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question is how these convergence
points are emerging in the growing margin
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, well, the postulate goes
actually to 19th century, when Hofmeister
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed, well, looking mainly at
philotaxis, but this is more general
[SPEAKER_00]: principle, at patterning processes and
formulated what is known as the first
[SPEAKER_00]: available space theory, according to which
new organs are created wherever is enough
[SPEAKER_00]: space for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we apply this to margin,
we have the following situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a leaf, small one, kind of leaf
primordium, in which we have a convergence
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This convergence point actually is the one
which patterned the position of this leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: at the first place as a part of
philotaxis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this leaf grows, and then it grows,
the margin expands, creating space for new
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the margin goes, more and more
convergence points are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you assume, according to the
observation, that convergence points
[SPEAKER_00]: correspond to the places where the leaf
grows faster outwards, then we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, a plausible mechanism of formation
of serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, would this work if we
put all these components into the model?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created the model, which is shown
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of like in the case of
Arabidopsis leaf, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the basic idea is that we have a
patterning process going on on the margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time where convergence point is
formed, growth outwards is accelerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is more accelerated when convergence
is higher, less when it is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pattern is supposed to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will the shape of a leaf emerge from
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is this process, kind of with
parameters, more or less taken at random.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that patterning takes place,
and so does growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have something like, well,
let's call it a generic lobed leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change parameters a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting a different pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now does it correspond to a real leaf or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it actually happens to correspond
quite closely to ivy leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is amazing, although, again,
we don't have molecular-level data about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, how close this correspondence is,
kind of lobe to lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, this one there,
this one here, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here, here, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that we don't have this detailed
data of ivy, well, can we make an
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I will show you this animation,
which at first may look like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like you to pay attention to a
phenomenon which actually is drawback of
[SPEAKER_00]: the model which I'm discussing just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you are going to see that some
convergence points are shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the leaf grows, they jump from one
position to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's look, let's say, at this area
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the similar situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So convergence points are formed,
but they are not stable, as the thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this kind of jumping of convergence
points have not really been observed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, so what is the
mechanism which stabilizes things there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to see what is the source of
the jumping, we should examine the first
[SPEAKER_00]: available space theory again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is an element there which is
actually sort of imprecise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppose that you have two existing organs,
and growth takes place, creating more
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, final space is sufficient to
introduce another organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one would say, and we can iterate this
process forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, space grows, and we iterate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that it's not the only
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another possibility, that an
existing kind of prototype of the organ is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be shifted, creating space for
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, although neither on the left nor
on the right side, we have enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can reorganize things,
we create enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of possibility exists,
but apparently is prevented in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is how?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, molecular data come into play
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that convergence point is
flanked by areas in which another protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules, cotyledons, or CAC, is being
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one hand, it is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: On another hand, if it is absent,
so in a mutant, entire paternic process is
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this, we amended the model
which I showed you, this up-to-gradient
[SPEAKER_00]: model, with two assumptions regarding CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that CAC is absent in convergence
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we implemented this by assuming that
high concentration of oxygen suppresses
[SPEAKER_00]: CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is that CAC is needed
for pin orientation to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then our simulation becomes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start in a situation where CAC is
present everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CAC is represented as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the locations where
convergence points appear, oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this increase of concentration of
oxygen eliminates CAC from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you assume that presence of CAC is
needed for a repolarization to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: this convergence point now is fixed
because there is no CAC there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So repolarization cannot occur anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a pattern which looks,
at first sight, similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CAC is present where oxygen is absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CAC is absent where oxygen is present
at high concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this absence of CAC here fixes a
location of primordial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more element to the story,
namely that it is known that CAC over
[SPEAKER_00]: expression makes indentation deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assumed that CAC has additional
effect of suppressing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a simple situation where the
presence of oxygen maxima promotes growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also the other side of the story
that presence of CAC is creating
[SPEAKER_00]: indentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put this into the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we have a situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here CAC is shown as pink dots because
yellow doesn't look well enough on such a
[SPEAKER_00]: size thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that pattern occurs of
indentations and serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there is no jumping of convergence
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, so the ability of reproducing white
type was part of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are also other elements of
validation of the model, so well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you create pin mutant, well,
it doesn't have serrations because
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence points cannot be formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we flood the model with oxygen,
we have the same situation as in reality
[SPEAKER_00]: that is that, again, there are no
serrations formed because flooding of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: with oxygen suppresses CAC, and
consequently, pins cannot reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have CAC, well, the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of CAC, pins cannot
reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we over express, then you have deeper
serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of first step in the
modeling of leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had grand plan at the beginning
from simple leafs to compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so far, we have tiny step in the
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we understand, well, situation
where some lobes or compoundingness
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, again, working with Mitos
Tiantis and with my student, Adam Ranions,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we turned our attention relative to
Arabidopsis, which is Calamine Hirsuta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it is a close relative,
it has very different leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Calamine Hirsuta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, well, where the
difference, which to our eye is a marked
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between these leaves,
comes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, one element of the puzzle is
that it is related to the group of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: in Knox family, of which BP, which I don't
dare to pronounce because it has long
[SPEAKER_00]: name, is representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that in Arabidopsis,
in which Knox genes are not expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, well, we have this kind of
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ectopically express BP, then we are
getting almost a compound leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Calamine Hirsuta, where BP is
present, where Knox genes are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaves, we are getting,
well, perfectly compound leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is kind of molecular side of the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or first macroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Calamine, new leaflets are formed in
the basal part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Arabidopsis, there's no outgrowth,
and here there is outgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we show where another Knox gene,
STM, is expressed in Calamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can clearly see that it is present in
this basal part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one part of the story regarding
difference between Calamine and
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another element which is important is to
look at veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look into Calamine leaf,
we can clearly see that leaflets are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the directions of veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something which was absent in
the model of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just assumed, well, there's some growth
of serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's accelerated growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the serrations are small,
in which direction they grow was not an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have an entire lobe or entire
leaflet, then in which direction it grows
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking these two facts together,
we created the following kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the veins present here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's visible here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veins define growth axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just postulate, because what we can
observe is only that growth axis are
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we assume that the mechanism which
patterns veins is defining directions of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is that Knox
potentiates CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what Knox is doing is,
well, first, it amplifies the action of
[SPEAKER_00]: CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, it amplifies this
suppression of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why these leaves occur would
be due to the fact that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: normal leaf maybe would look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CAC is expressed, potentiated by Knox,
makes this big indentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Knox is needed for the formation
of new organs to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this, we created a model which
works as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a leaf primordium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the base, we have expression of Knox,
shown in yellow, and CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tip, convergence point,
is marked by the convergence point of pin
[SPEAKER_00]: and presence of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAC, Knox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen promotes leaflet growth,
so it becomes bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAC constrains growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, when working together with Knox,
they create this narrow form at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at some point, new convergence
point emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, growth starts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, further growth, further formation of
lateral leaflets cannot happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't have here Knox or CAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this dominance of Knox and CAC has
been broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growth occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this growth is going to be in the
direction of veins which we assume are
[SPEAKER_00]: perpendicular to the original direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see how it works in an animation
or simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So main growth direction is established by
this axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, at some point, new convergence
points occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow in perpendicular direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process iterates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to see subsequent leaflets
being formed in the basepetal progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is comparison with,
well, a young leaf of cardamom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that, well, this
progression of leaflets near the base was
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less captured by the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the shape of the terminal leaf
was not really captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is that,
when modeling the terminal leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did not really incorporate vasculature
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the question is, well, can we
increase the very similar to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: similitude of leafs by looking at veins
more closely?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do this, we developed a
model which actually operates at a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly higher level of abstraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we no longer model explicitly
interaction of oxygen with pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just using the fact that,
as a result of this interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: new convergence points can be formed at
some distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, interaction between pin and
oxygen is a way of measuring distances
[SPEAKER_00]: along the margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process is modulated by the
presence or absence of substances such as
[SPEAKER_00]: cac and nox, which can say that,
well, even though the distances are
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively large, but because of,
say, absence of cac or nox, a new
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence point cannot be formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot appear there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at things from this
perspective, we have the following basic
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are happening on the margin and
within the lamina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growth centers are formed by this
distant measuring process at the margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between growth centers, so between,
let's say, here and there, growth
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a region where, at some distance
from convergence points, where cac is
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creation of a convergence point is
associated with the formation of vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first mid-vein goes to the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent veins connect to the previously
formed vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And veins define growth direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here, growth is going to
be upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is going to be, well,
combination of this upwards coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: this vein and lateral coming from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is nox, which is kind of
amplifying the action of cacs and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed, let's say, in a slightly
different region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within this model, the key element of
growth suppression is the substance red
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding to cac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that as the leaf margin expands,
this cac region is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, a new convergence point is
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we create this kind of model and put
these elements together, just the element
[SPEAKER_00]: which I described, convergence point on
the margin, veins connecting convergence
[SPEAKER_00]: points to inter-network, and it's defining
the direction of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growth rates and possibility of
creating convergence points modulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: cac and nox, we can get, for example,
this kind of growth progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a sample simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have kept the leaf of a constant
size on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to change states,
because if I made the leaf grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first stages would be very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things can be scaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaf, as it grows, is always scaled
to the same size on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are getting quite a plausible leaf
of which we just found, a simple leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we could try to say whether it is
leaf of a cherry or something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but reasonable generic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: By changing parameters of the model,
we can easily change the form of this
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by changing one thing,
which is branching angle, we can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like a ginkgo leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is, well, maybe more interesting
fact, that if we increase the,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, strength or impact of cac,
so that it creates deeper indentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have progression from a simple to
a, well, dissected form, or kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: high-lobed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moreover, you can see that there is a
difference in the underlying architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here, for example,
is there are no, here the lateral veins to
[SPEAKER_00]: the left, but not to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here it appears to the right,
and here we have to the right as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so because as this indentation
was created, it was absent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional space has been created between
convergence points as measured along the
[SPEAKER_00]: margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this provided room for additional
convergence points and additional veins
[SPEAKER_00]: which support the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which we have interaction between cac,
shown in red, and nox, shown in blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates deeper veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have an example which I would like
to manipulate, but I need different
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses for this, so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what I would like to show you now
is that by changing some quite intuitive
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters, we can obtain large variation
of shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basic simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of highly-lobed leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: as shown in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let us suppose that the cac,
that the impact of cac on indentation is
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are getting a leaf which has simply
still this basic form of having three
[SPEAKER_00]: lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is much more smooth because,
well, red color is not creating such a
[SPEAKER_00]: deep indentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's assume that the impact of blue
morphogen, so nox, is decreased as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and lobes maintain competence of
creating new veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are just getting a simple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's suppose that the growth
rates associated with the veins are
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are getting heart-shaped leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see one more example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from Canada, I had to model
maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there are smaller kind
of indentations which are due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of cac, and deeper ones which are
due to the presence of nox, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of more sparsely located at cac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you further analyze the interplay
between cac and nox, we can create this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of morpho space, which, okay,
so here it is kind of like a basic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we increase repression of growth by
cac, we are getting, well, kind of a form
[SPEAKER_00]: which simply has deeper lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we increase it by nox, we can get to
the point where you have actual progress
[SPEAKER_00]: to a leaf which is compound, which has
three different leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I could pretty much move to
conclusions here, but well, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't mind, I would like to spend five
minutes talking about something which may
[SPEAKER_00]: appear completely different, and I hope
you will be surprised that actually it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not so completely different, and it is
inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a field of, well, common
yarrow, and this is, well, kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of yarrow from the top and also
diagrammatic construction from which
[SPEAKER_00]: representation, from which one can see
that actually one feature of this
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence and many other
inflorescences together known as corrimps
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they form a very flat surface,
and this is related to the fact that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are pollinated, well, mainly by flies
which actually are walking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence and pollinating one flower
after another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from evolutionary perspective,
it makes sense for this to be flat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how this flatness can happen in
nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is kind of, well, more traditional
point of view which looks at
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescences as branching structures,
decorated with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some branching structure which
is looking like this, and if we follow
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea, then the branching structure
would have to grow according to quite
[SPEAKER_00]: complex trigonometric rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, in order to bring this
flower to the same height as this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this S2 would have to be S1 cosine
alpha, and in order to bring this flower
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same level, well, even in two
dimensions, the trigonometry becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex, and if we imagine, if we realize
that it is two-dimensional structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, synchronization of this growth rate
to bring everything to the same level
[SPEAKER_00]: would be, well, quite a difficult
trigonometric problem on which many people
[SPEAKER_00]: would have, well, hard time, well,
not making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does not look very likely that plant
is doing this trigonometry to find out,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring all flowers to the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings us to an alternative idea
in which, if it is not so, that
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence is a branching structure
decorated with flowers, but flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: being created at the same level,
and then branching structure is just
[SPEAKER_00]: scaffolding with created, well,
to support these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the idea which is very similar
to the idea of development of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, in the inflorescent
meristem in this case, we have creation of
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here I drew this in two dimensions,
but I will show this in three dimensions
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the structure grows,
vascular connections are created in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way, but in three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As veins in a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the same way in which
indentations in leaf are formed,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we have these gaps in between,
and eventually wind up with a branching
[SPEAKER_00]: structure supporting all flowers at
approximately the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing which we have to assume
here is that the growth is roughly uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see whether it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we have to create, well,
not a pattern of equidistant convergence
[SPEAKER_00]: points along the leaf margin, but on the
surface of the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is using the first available
space algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pattern of, let's say,
new convergence points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the inflorescence of yarrow is
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to go a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And assume that the primordia,
which are big enough, can create higher
[SPEAKER_00]: order primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the layout of individual
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, flower heads, because now these
flower heads are connected into a
[SPEAKER_00]: branching structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time when a primordium appears,
it is connected into branching structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a three-dimensional thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at this from underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how the branching
structure is formed as a scaffolding
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proper arrangement of flowers comes
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scaffolding comes next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we now place flowers where they
should be, we are getting this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: model, which is shown on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can compare it to the model on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is totally different ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We no longer have leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the same common denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formation of pattern of convergence points
on the margin of the structure with a
[SPEAKER_00]: margin of the leaf or surface of the South
African meristem, connection into
[SPEAKER_00]: basculature, and its further growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go back.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things which I removed from the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this looks like the same model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, this is not a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actual 3D model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how this branching
structure and layout of flowers looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also see here another thing if
you zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you can see this here or
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see is that the pattern
petals are intersecting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something which, using
computer models, is quite difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nature clearly doesn't have problems
with this because as already Aristotle
[SPEAKER_00]: observed, in the place where something is,
something else cannot be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent actually a substantial amount
of time trying to address this in computer
[SPEAKER_00]: models as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of like the current stage
of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have employed
relatively sophisticated algorithms for
[SPEAKER_00]: handling biomechanically surfaces which
collide with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in some cases,
for example, in this petal, it is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: deflected because there was another one
underneath which was pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same situation is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are coming closer and closer to
having a real arrow through the modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing that actually we're so much
energy goes is how to compute these
[SPEAKER_00]: intersections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concluding synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth of leaves, but not only of leaves,
actually of many structures proceed as
[SPEAKER_00]: follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have interplay between growth and form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So form is a result of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth of leaves in fluorescences is
driven by pattern of convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this point on the boundary,
which specifies where to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and vasculature, which specifies in which
direction to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an interplay between a pattern on
the boundary and vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namely, pattern of the boundary specifies
where the veins start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where the veins end is determined
by either the base of the structure or
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of previous veins, which explains
this feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Existing veins help determine where new
veins are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is this loop, which is due
to Hofmeister, that as things are becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger, they create room for new elements
on the boundary, new convergence points,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are placed between existing ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, as the things grow,
they can modify vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vasculature may have also an impact on
where convergence points are appearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads to something like,
well, conclusion, which to me actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost obvious, except that sometimes when
I state it, well, I have vicious
[SPEAKER_00]: opposition to the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is that mechanistic understanding
of plant form from molecular level
[SPEAKER_00]: patterning to microscopic form appears to
be within the reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are finding more and more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, it may be so that some theories
which we have already will have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced by others or refined,
like in the case of this Abzugradian
[SPEAKER_00]: patterning of oxygen, which is now being
refined to, well, a more plausible
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of this, a picture emerges,
which can actually mean that biology may
[SPEAKER_00]: be moving more and more in the direction
of physics, where we have some underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lots of things emerge from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ernest Rutherford famously said that,
well, all science is either physics or
[SPEAKER_00]: stump collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that, well, the development
of biology is moving closer and closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, well, physical understanding of the
world, where we have a relatively small
[SPEAKER_00]: number of general principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things can be deduced from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic mechanisms are setting up the
playground for these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of them have self-organizing
character, as shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to acknowledge Adam
Ranions and Andrew Owens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam Ranions was the primary person
behind the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Owens is working on inforestensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are collaborating with Mitos
Tiantis on leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Regine Kassenbockhoff from Johannes
Gutenberg University in Mainz on
[SPEAKER_00]: inforestensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to ask this question based on the
fact that you had a mechanism where the
[SPEAKER_05]: cells were sensing efflux and influx,
that there was some asymmetry there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on that, I wonder if your model
was second order with respect to space and
[SPEAKER_05]: time, or first order with respect to space
and time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why did you choose it?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what do you mean by first order with
respect of space and time and second
[SPEAKER_00]: order?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, Maxwell's equations,
which would model your version points,
[SPEAKER_05]: is second order.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the solutions are first order.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you put your controls to different
cuts in knocks, and had them affect the
[SPEAKER_05]: second order, you'll get an asymmetry
that's different than if you put it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: first order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, in the model in which we
have this polarization by unidirectional
[SPEAKER_00]: fluxes, it is described by the set of
first order equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't, in particular, observe second
order phenomena, which would be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like waves propagating, which is related
to, well, oscillations of this type don't
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which doesn't mean that they cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing is that this result is quite
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't connect it with a cut and
knocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have only oxygen pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have oxygen pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some network, which is detecting,
measuring out flux and influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mathematical analysis of this entire
model is still to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have done quite an extensive set of
simulations showing that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this convergence point formation in
one case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polarization, well, kind of long
distance polarization consistent with
[SPEAKER_00]: canalization, so coordinated one in the
other case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the switch from one to another mode,
well, that actually the impact of influx
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look into the feedback loop,
which is driving, well, the polarization
[SPEAKER_00]: of pins, and compare the strengths of
influence of out flux to influx,
[SPEAKER_00]: forming a linear form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, let's say, over all polarization
is, well, out flux plus alpha influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if alpha changes the sign,
we have a change of situation from one to
[SPEAKER_00]: another type of polarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But alpha can be very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, let's say, 1,000th of the
impact of out flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that influx is this kind of,
well, controlling thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have not answered your question
well directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I told you what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results which we have now are
basically simulation results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we qualitatively understand why the
sign of influence of influx causes this
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitative change in behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike previous models of oxygen,
which have been mathematically analyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: quite extensively, this one we have not
analyzed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a paper which has been accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main attention of reviewers was
actually not on the mathematical analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but was on what kind of potential
mechanism at the molecular level could be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesized about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could entertain more discussion about
this than about actual mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I find really interesting in your
models is that you're using relatively few
[SPEAKER_01]: variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's an interplay of less than
a handful of genes that would contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to this pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if using your model if you
can look like, I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, go outside of the leaf that you
looked at and try to predict it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, how close within reach are you
predicting what we see in nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, can you tell if you're missing a
character?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it would be a group of species
that has another gene that is in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is more of a hypothetical type
of question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, well, not so much is known about
what happens, let's say, regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: different species of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is actually known is primaderm node
for Arbidopsis cardaminae and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the models are operating in such a way
that they're assuming that there are genes
[SPEAKER_00]: which are coding something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are abstracting, rather than
thinking directly in terms of genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are thinking about in terms of
geometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geometric properties, geometric patterning
properties, which are dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, and then how the geometric
patterning processes result in actual
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a kind of primary role in these models
is allocated to the way distances are
[SPEAKER_00]: measured, how the measurement of the
distances can be modified by substances
[SPEAKER_00]: which are expressed on the margin,
and a little bit combinatorics,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, in the sense of ABC model of
flower development, combinatorics of these
[SPEAKER_00]: morphogenes on the margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very possible that there are many
genes which are involved, because many
[SPEAKER_00]: genes may have effect of increasing
distances, decreasing distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that we can represent these
things in terms of a small number of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables doesn't mean that a small number
of genes is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, well, as I said, there can be
many genes acting in the same or similar
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the fact that such a
small number of parameters are involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is correlated with the fact,
which was my opening statement,
[SPEAKER_00]: that in nature, this change of form is
very easily achievable, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: change of form between simple and
compound, in spite of the fact that to our
[SPEAKER_00]: eye, there is a huge difference in these
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to a plant, this is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is actually a sort of
guiding information that if it is easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: do in nature, it should be also easy to do
well in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this sense, the fact that there is
a small number of parameters is,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, kind of like, well, indirect,
well, not confirmation, but signs that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably maybe on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it is very satisfying that
it can be so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look, everything depends on
the level of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you look into text on
anatomy of leaves, or also the detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: description of shape, for example,
there is entire classification regarding,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what is exactly the shape of the
tip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't look into this in full
detail, but our gut feeling is that those
[SPEAKER_00]: might be very much, well, again,
not controlled directly by genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mechanical properties of the margin
and blade are controlled, resulting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of definitely not the end
of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like also to create more
comprehensive morphospaces, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: created a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't say that I feel that we
have covered the entire morphospaces of
[SPEAKER_00]: our leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it is within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your early models, where you're just
looking at the effect of oxen and not
[SPEAKER_03]: including noxin, you can pretty well
reproduce the shape of a rabbit octopus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious about the relationship between
the concentration of oxen at the margins
[SPEAKER_03]: and the rate of leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which presumably also went into your later
models as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you look at the early leaf,
oxen concentration seems to be relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: uniform around the periphery.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as the leaf expands, it gets more
localized, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that didn't seem
quite right was you saw very large
[SPEAKER_03]: gradients of oxen concentration along the
margins of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it didn't appear that there were large
gradients in the rates of elongation or
[SPEAKER_03]: expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had high concentrations of oxen in
the convergence points, low in the valleys
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rates of leaf expansion between
those didn't seem to vary much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the example of this leaf is perfect
example in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I described is a part of the story
which was focused on the action of the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, this process is superimposed
on the assumption that there is an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient of leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the paper where we describe
this, this model is described in painful
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the basic part of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was focusing on the formation of
additional features.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so you're looking at the additional
expansion that's caused by the high oxen
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this, why it may be so
precisely, that is that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is no NOx there, so there is not
much potentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we put a NOx there, we have bigger
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forgive me if I missed this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you successfully mapped the
vascular architecture onto the leaves?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, if the model has
looking traditional validation,
[SPEAKER_04]: then there's got to be, or at least there
should be a reasonable one-to-one mapping
[SPEAKER_04]: between the primary vasculature and the
actual outline of the leaf itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, like for example,
in the case of maple here, it is not so
[SPEAKER_00]: far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, we are very far because
actually we are assuming here that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, from what I described, it is kind of
evident that we are limited to
[SPEAKER_00]: non-reticulate vascular systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open vascular systems, we don't have
loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But loops are a very prominent feature of
many, many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some rationale for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Scarpella's model of venation
formation, even in the case of when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have loops in the leaf, veins start in the
way we just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little bit later on, this connection
between convergence points and actual
[SPEAKER_00]: veins disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a vein is being formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in the case of leaves which have
loops, initial process is such as I
[SPEAKER_00]: described, or it seems to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody knows how actually,
well, looped venation systems are created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent considerable amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I have another talk about,
well, venation patterns specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can create some kind of loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was already part of the first model
of Michison's that he had some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: loops produced in his model of vascular
pattern formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of these models actually is very
robust or looks very much like a real
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that, well, if we have the
situation that vasculature, if we just
[SPEAKER_00]: form initially, persists to later forms
rather than creating a close, reorganizing
[SPEAKER_00]: itself into closed loops, then if we can
see reasonably the correspondence between
[SPEAKER_00]: our vascular systems and reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when loops are formed, then we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to, at some moment,
to have this moment of illumination and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out, oh, so this is how loops are
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't happen yet.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how, it seems like you can match the
final form of the model to the loop quite
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how closely does it match the
developmental series?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, halfway through the simulation,
if you stop it, does it look like the loop
[SPEAKER_02]: halfway through the five-second
development?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, in the case of Arabidopsis,
it looks actually OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, basically, we are just
assuming that there is some pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is actually a sequence of
emergence of serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our model reproduces this sequence
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is the case, well, in the case
of Kardamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the case of Kardamine,
our model is actually describing correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: the early phases and not the later ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is that,
actually, in the case of Kardamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see these long, thin segments of
rachis and petiolules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it is not clear,
at all, what factor creates this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: linear organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are looking for what gene it
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day, there is some candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day, it is improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assume that there is something
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to do with NOx.
[SPEAKER_00]: But NOx, by itself, is not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example where we can
actually simulate development of younger
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot go farther away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, actually, there is a lot of
things which are related to the fact that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many leaves, especially in trees,
leaves are developing initially in a form
[SPEAKER_00]: which is folded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, to what extent the
fact that it is folded, and within a bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: which provides constraints, may provide
important developmental cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a factor to which, to some
extent, we have been looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other people have been looking at
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a model which I have shown it
here, this has not been integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that, in some cases,
we can capture this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
