[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Mark, and I hope you
can all hear me and also see this
[SPEAKER_04]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the introduction and also
for inviting me to speak here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only too bad I couldn't be in Cornell
in person, but that's how it is right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sitting at home right now in a dark
November evening in Sweden, in the south
[SPEAKER_04]: of Sweden.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the title of this talk might seem a bit
obscure, but the story I want to tell is
[SPEAKER_04]: about genomic selection, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suppose that many or most of you
maybe are familiar to some extent with
[SPEAKER_04]: genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even if you've never heard about this
before, I think that that won't be a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem because this is not a talk that
will be very heavy on technical details.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more about what genomic selection
means for practical plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it's a little bit of my personal
reflection on how genomic selection has
[SPEAKER_04]: been received and implemented in the plant
breeding community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will show you some examples from our
spring oat breeding program that I,
[SPEAKER_04]: until one month ago, was responsible for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have another position which is
called group manager population
[SPEAKER_04]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mark described a little bit about what
that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it will become maybe a little
bit more clear in this at the end of my
[SPEAKER_04]: talk as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like just Mark to introduce Lundman
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will just say a few words about the
company I work for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty big company for Swedish in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an agricultural cooperative.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is owned by practically all Swedish
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 20,000 farmers in Sweden all have a
share in this cooperative.
[SPEAKER_04]: We employ about 10,000 people and work in
a number of countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are, as we usually say,
involved in the entire value chain,
[SPEAKER_04]: meaning from the farmer, from the seed,
up until the consumer product,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bread, the muesli, the pasta,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we supply the farmer with whatever he
or she needs in terms of seed fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_04]: machinery, other types of equipment and
consumables.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we then buy the harvest and produce
from the farmer and turn that into a
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one part of this company, this
operation, is plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a plant breeding unit,
which is located, and here you see a map
[SPEAKER_04]: of Sweden and Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are located at the southernmost
part of Sweden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see on the map to the right,
it's out on the countryside in a little
[SPEAKER_04]: village called Sladeg.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an area of large farms and
agricultural landscapes, vast fields,
[SPEAKER_04]: while the rest of Sweden is mostly
forested, as you might know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this park looks more like Denmark or
continental Europe than the rest of
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where the most agricultural
activities and products are produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also where most of the,
well, we don't have a lot of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding companies, actually, in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's we, us, London, and a company called
Malibu Hidatsa, Sweden should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant breeding in Sweden has a long
history, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is sort of a, well, a
phylogenetic, tree, you could say,
[SPEAKER_04]: of 150 years of Swedish plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It started in Sladeg, in this little
village, in the 1870s or 1880s,
[SPEAKER_04]: where some large farmers got together and
thought that we need better seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk some kind of plant breeding
activities here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they established something called the
Swedish Feed Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had a company, and then Sladeg
quickly became quite an active and
[SPEAKER_04]: important center in early plant breeding
and genetics research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have been doing plant breeding
since then, under different names and with
[SPEAKER_04]: different owners.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a while, the company was known as
Sladeg Abel, all day, as Mark said,
[SPEAKER_04]: as mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're part of this big lump man group,
a small unit in a big company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has its advantages and its
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have this long, long tradition of
plant breeding, which we can grow off of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we have been breeding over the
years about 50 or 60 or so different
[SPEAKER_04]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we do cereals, wheat, barley,
oats, and criticales.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do spring oilseed rape or canola.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of parts, grasses and
legumes, and also fava beans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have willows, a salt, bioenergy tree
that we breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll soon start also a pea breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, these are all
crops that have different modes of
[SPEAKER_04]: reproduction and different genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are inbred lines, some are hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some, as departures, are not pure lines,
but heterogeneous populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some are clonally propagated and
usually highly heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like potatoes, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of genomic selection and the
development of prediction models,
[SPEAKER_04]: they all have their own challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it can be quite demanding to apply
genomic selection in this rather diverse
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you would ask someone to mention
or name the most important milestones in
[SPEAKER_04]: the history of plant breeding,
you would probably come up with something
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from the website of Euroseed,
the European Seed Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this starts all the way from the
domestication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have different crops that
were domesticated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have mandolin, you have hybrid
breeding, and you have mutation breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: and genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And GMOs and gene transfer and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is all very well and important
steps in the history of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I, if you ask me, I would argue that
there are only three really important
[SPEAKER_04]: milestones in the modern or recent history
of plant breeding since the discovery of
[SPEAKER_04]: mandal walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is my own personal view of the
history of plant breeding since the 1880s
[SPEAKER_04]: or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first event was what I call plant
breeding 1.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the idea of the concept of
individual plant selection, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: mass selection in land races.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a breeder in Svala, actually
called Jan van Nielsen, who in 1896
[SPEAKER_04]: thought that it would be better to,
instead of doing mass selection in very
[SPEAKER_04]: diverse populations, isolate individual
plants and propagate offspring from
[SPEAKER_04]: individual plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this way, to develop inbred pure
line, he worked with cereals.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was sort of in anticipation,
you could say, of Johansson's theory of
[SPEAKER_04]: inbred lines and concepts of the genotype
and the phenotype, which came some years
[SPEAKER_04]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this turned out to be really
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They developed many new varieties,
very good varieties, used in individual
[SPEAKER_04]: plant selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next milestone was not long after
that, when a guy called Jan van Nielsen,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, invented or thought that it would be
a good idea to do cross breeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: to cross plant, in order to obtain
superior recombinant genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, he grew upon the theory of
Mendo that had just been discovered some
[SPEAKER_04]: years earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was strongly influenced by,
you know, Eric Schermack and Karl Correns,
[SPEAKER_04]: and those who discovered Mendo's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually visited him in Svala,
and he got to learn from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he became one of the most prominent
genetic researchers in the early 20th
[SPEAKER_04]: century, and was also head of the breeding
in Svala.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was one of the first who could show
that continuous trade, or competitive
[SPEAKER_04]: trade, have a Mendelian basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he introduced cross breeding,
and that was very controversial at that
[SPEAKER_04]: time, because people thought that,
oh, you're just great chaos if you try to
[SPEAKER_04]: cross plant, and God knows what you will
find in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, that turned out to be
really successful as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's now, of course, an established
mode of work in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, not a lot happened actually in
plant breeding until around 2010,
[SPEAKER_04]: when genomic selection was introduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's hard to put a year on
that because it's a process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say around 2010, it had become
sort of accepted in the plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the breeding community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sort of ushers in the era of
plant breeding that I call plant breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: 3.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my mind, this is the first really
transformative change in how we do plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding since the introduction of cross
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it's more important than,
for example, genetic transformation,
[SPEAKER_04]: or mutation breeding, or hybrid breeding,
because it changes fundamentally the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that we approach and think of plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will try to explain what I mean by that
in this talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, yeah, and in 2014,
I can't see this myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, we established OATS 3.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we started to do genomic
selection as a routine method in our
[SPEAKER_03]: spring oak breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you actually look at what I call
plant breeding 2.0, on the right-hand
[SPEAKER_04]: side, you see a schematic illustration of
a pedigree breeding set up for a sowing
[SPEAKER_04]: crop from a 2015 book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the left-hand side, you see
something that looks pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from a Swiss drawing from this
Chinese, from ALS, from 1912.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that in many respects,
not a lot has happened since plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding 2.0 started in the early 20th
century.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at how breeding of stalking
crops look today, or up until today at
[SPEAKER_04]: least, this is how plant breeding 2.0
typically looks in a cereal crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: stalking cereal crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the left, you see a picture,
an image of some small crops in a field.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the early generations,
in this case, S4 generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps you can see that there are
five rows in that little crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each of those rows is one inbred,
it's not totally inbred, it's an S4,
[SPEAKER_04]: but still on its way to be inbred line.
[SPEAKER_04]: We treat them as separate lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have about 20 or 30,000 of these lines
in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, in the early generations of a
breeding program, we have about 10 to the
[SPEAKER_04]: four, 10 to the five different lines of
unotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you usually have very little seed of
each, so you plant them, you have them,
[SPEAKER_04]: you keep them as single plants or in rows
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happens, is that as you go
through the generation, you discard about
[SPEAKER_04]: 99% of your line until you come to the
advanced generation, which maybe is S6 or
[SPEAKER_04]: S7 or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're down to 10 to the second
genus, or about a hundred or so,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe up to a thousand different genotypes
that you can plant, big plots in several
[SPEAKER_04]: sites with replication for over several
years, and that allows you, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: to estimate phenotypic values with the
greater precision than is possible in the
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it is in the early generations
that you have to do most of your
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to throw away 99% of your line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually that is made, the selection
decision is often made purely on a,
[SPEAKER_04]: by visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, in this case, this is oats you
can see here, so I would walk up and down
[SPEAKER_04]: these rows in the field and just look at
the plants or the rows and say that this
[SPEAKER_04]: row I want to keep and this row I throw
away and this I'm going to keep and looks
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the more or less hope for the
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the way that I would say the
majority of plants are just the other word
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basing early selection on some kind of
visual evaluation of small sets of plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: or small number of plants, which is
something particularly genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a couple of years ago then,
or it's now six years ago, we asked
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves how efficient is this really?
[SPEAKER_04]: How good is this early selection that we
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we decided to do a little experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sometimes picked out the breeder in the
field and that was me to pick out the best
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, the best rows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we just selected the same number
of rows quite randomly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we, eventually they ended up in
the field trials, like the ones you can
[SPEAKER_04]: see on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could evaluate my selection versus
the random selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And surprise, surprise, there was
absolutely no difference between breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: selected lines and randomly selected lines
for a number of important traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: economically important traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our main breeding goals, grain yield,
volume weight of the grain, the grain
[SPEAKER_04]: weight and grain size.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no significant difference at all
between the breeder and the random,
[SPEAKER_04]: purely random selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some cases the random selection was
actually better than the breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was, well, I mean, I had expected
this to happen, but it was far scary and
[SPEAKER_04]: encouraging at the same time to see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was afraid I would be fired,
of course, after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you see this and you conclude
that the breeder has no ability at all to
[SPEAKER_04]: be, sorry, to do a better selection than a
pure random selection, you have two
[SPEAKER_04]: options basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either you carry on with random selection,
you just generate random numbers in an
[SPEAKER_04]: Excel sheet and that's very cheap and it's
straightforward and you don't have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: any particular competence to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can try to improve your selection
method.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we tried to improve our selection
method, of course, and this is how we
[SPEAKER_04]: started to implement genomic selection in
those to increase the selection accuracy
[SPEAKER_04]: in early generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also where the plant breeder's
equation again comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need to be reminded of this or
that, the plant breeder's equation
[SPEAKER_04]: describes how the mean of a trait changes
as a result of selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you will have a starting population
with some distribution or some trait value
[SPEAKER_04]: or value for some trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you select the best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can also select the worst ones,
sort of the lowest ones that you select
[SPEAKER_04]: the top ones for the green portion here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you intermate all those individuals in
that green portion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you measure then the offspring,
the collective offspring from that those
[SPEAKER_04]: intermating, you will find that if the
trait is heritable, it will have shifted.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mean will have increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the magnitude of that increase in
relation to the magnitude of the selection
[SPEAKER_04]: differential is defined as the
heritability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also define it in terms of as
I've done here, selection intensity,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is related to the proportion of the
population that you select.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you select a very small proportion of
your starting population, you will have a
[SPEAKER_04]: strong selection intensity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have the additive standard
deviation, the additive genetic standard
[SPEAKER_04]: deviation that is, and you have the
selection accuracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the parameters that I work
with in the wheel program to improve your
[SPEAKER_04]: response to selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you just saw, the selection
accuracy we had in our spring out breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: program was zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't really expect any response to
selection at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is another way to view
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a simple randomly generated
distribution of let's say of a trait,
[SPEAKER_04]: in an F4 population, the white bars here,
10,000 lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you select out of those 10,100
lines randomly, and you produce an F7
[SPEAKER_04]: population eventually, for example,
then the distribution in that F7
[SPEAKER_04]: population will account for the small red
distribution at the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mean will not be different from the
mean of the big white F4 population.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there will be, by chance, of course,
some lines that are slightly better and
[SPEAKER_04]: some lines that are slightly worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if then you select the lines that are
slightly better and use those as parents
[SPEAKER_04]: for your next breeding cycle, then you
will have a small selection differential,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you will have a small response in the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, even if though you have selected at
random, you can have the response to
[SPEAKER_04]: selection, since there will be some,
by chance, some F7 lines that are better
[SPEAKER_04]: and some that are worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do good yield trials with good
precision, you will be able to find those.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you can select your,
in your F4 lines, you can select with an
[SPEAKER_04]: accuracy of 0.5, you will have F7 lines
with a much larger, with a much higher
[SPEAKER_04]: mean than your original F4 population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if you select the best of
those to be parents for your next breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle, then you will have a larger
selection differential and a larger
[SPEAKER_04]: response.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is why it's so important to have
good selection accuracy in early
[SPEAKER_04]: generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we who work in commercial
plant breeding, we also, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: focus quite a lot on the duration of the
breeding cycle and the gain, the selection
[SPEAKER_04]: response per unit time or the genetic gain
per unit time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that depends on, as we have seen
before, the selection intensity,
[SPEAKER_04]: the selection accuracy, the additive
genetic variation, or some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: variation in this case, and the duration
of the breeding cycle, which is in the
[SPEAKER_04]: agent denominator here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do some simulations,
or you can also look at this analytically,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see that the parameters with the
largest effect on gain that you can play
[SPEAKER_04]: around with, is or are the selection or
the generation interval or the duration of
[SPEAKER_04]: the breeding cycle and the accuracy of
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: The intensity and the amount of variance
that you have, have a comparatively
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller effect on the gain per unit time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we decided to work with generation
intervals or duration of the breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle and the accuracy of selection to
improve.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get the most out of our genetic
improvement, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, that's in most breeding
programs today, the breeding cycle are far
[SPEAKER_04]: too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be up to seven, eight,
nine years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for that is, of course,
that if you select a parent for your next
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle, you must be able to base that
selection on some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But normally, you base that selection on
the performance in yield trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you cannot do yield trials until you
are in the advanced generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: which usually takes seven, five,
six, seven, eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: For that reason, you get very long
breeding cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have been able to select your
parents already in the early generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you would have a much shorter
breeding cycle and a much larger gain per
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, there is not much data to
base your selection of parents on in most
[SPEAKER_04]: cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, of course, you can use genetic
markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the question is, can we use genetic
markers?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are certain notes, shorts of
markers around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is the timeline of genetic
marker development in plants and plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And started already now 30 years ago with
RFOPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no sane person would work with RFOPs
today in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not really until the PCR technology
allowed us to generate thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: markers, hundreds of markers and thousands
of markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had the rapid markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually got the micro satellites,
the SSR markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had AFOP markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had dark markers, which is some kind of
the RFOP, more or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do QTL maps, but there were
association mapping studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that was done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you have SNP arrays.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also have the sequencing of entire
genome, which has become cheaper and
[SPEAKER_04]: practically feasible nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now we have, most of the maybe
crops have been deepened with the wheat,
[SPEAKER_04]: the barley, rye, oats have been done,
rapeseed is done, many other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have genomic sequences of the more
or less good resolution and quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, as I said, there's no lack
of markers to be used in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was missing was some kind of
theoretical or conceptual or
[SPEAKER_04]: methodological framework to use markers in
a good way in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that happened, you could say,
with the advent of genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually you take the publication of this
paper in 2000 as a starting point of
[SPEAKER_04]: genomic selection, or in 2001.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not an entirely new idea at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There had been similar ideas around for a
while, but this was the first time that
[SPEAKER_04]: someone really sort of formulated a
coherent idea of genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was, of course, looking at animal
breeding first.
[SPEAKER_04]: The author said here that it was concluded
that selection of genetic values predicted
[SPEAKER_04]: from markers could substantially increase
the rate of genetic gain in animals and
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, especially if combined with wheat
production techniques shorten regeneration
[SPEAKER_04]: intervals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they realized that selection accuracy
and the breeding cycle time were the
[SPEAKER_04]: important parameters here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you're not familiar with genomic
selection, this is a very short sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: course in genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the heart of genomic selection is a
prediction model, which is a statistical
[SPEAKER_04]: device that allows you to predict
phenotypes, basically, or breeding values
[SPEAKER_04]: from genetic marker data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you need to build a prediction
model is some kind of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get that data from a training
population, from which you collect
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes and you collect genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you take that and you build your
prediction model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go to your breeding population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you genotype your breeding
population, and you plug those genopathic
[SPEAKER_04]: data into your prediction model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can predict phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple concept, really,
even though the statistics behind it can
[SPEAKER_04]: be extremely complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the question of how to apply
genomic selection in a practical breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: program and virtuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So genomic selection is different from
what we usually call marker assistant
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, you use a small set of markers,
maybe just one marker or a few markers,
[SPEAKER_04]: to tag trade in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that idea has been around since the
markers were invented, since the isopime
[SPEAKER_04]: era, really, in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the main reasons why marker
assistant selection really hasn't taken
[SPEAKER_04]: off that much in plant breeding is that
it's really not useful for highly
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinated genetic traits, traits that are
controlled by hundreds of genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just can't be handled by marker assistant
selection, whereas they are sort of made
[SPEAKER_04]: for genomic selection, more or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: In marker assistant selection,
furthermore, you have to detect first your
[SPEAKER_04]: marker trait associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to develop some kind of mapping
population, either by current population
[SPEAKER_04]: or a association mapping panel or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas in genomic selection, you just
don't, it's just implicit in the model,
[SPEAKER_04]: but somewhere in your data, there is an
association.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a linkage between some of your
markers, at least, and the trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shall miss the minor QTLs when you do
marker trait association studies in the
[SPEAKER_04]: selection unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's maybe a more philosophical
way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you usually, you select, you build the
genotype, basically, in genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: You build, you collect the good genes in a
line or a variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is most important, I think,
is that genomic selection allows you to
[SPEAKER_04]: make significant reduction in breeding
cycle time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has large effect, as we have seen,
on genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you read magazines like
this, you will have seen that genomics has
[SPEAKER_04]: been very, very valuable in animal
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The value of cows have increased a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see here on the top right that the
average, well, that's the average gain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's monetary gain per year has increased
a lot since the introduction of genomic
[SPEAKER_04]: selection in capital breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also that the generation interval has
gone down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly for bulls, since you don't
really phenotype bulls for many traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: such as milk production, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to phenotype the offspring,
the doctors, and that takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do it with with a genomic
prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, you save a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have much shorter generation
interval.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has had significant effect in animal
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the plant breeding has been slower to
take up genomic selection in practical
[SPEAKER_04]: plant breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's even been questioned if genomic
selection has a future at all in plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are two animal breeding researchers
in Sweden that wrote this paper a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I ask that question is that
animal and plant breeding are quite
[SPEAKER_04]: different in how they are structured and
built up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from a publication by John Hickey
a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: In animal breeding, you focus quite a lot
on population improvement, rapid recurrent
[SPEAKER_04]: selection cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from which illustrated with this wheel
on top of the pyramid there to your left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rapid cycles of mating, selection,
mating, selection, mating, selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from that cycle, you extract the
producers, the animal that's actually
[SPEAKER_04]: going to produce the milk or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas plant breeding has focused quite a
lot, particularly for cereals and inbred
[SPEAKER_04]: crops, on line development, a slow process
of inbreeding and development of inbred
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, extensive field testing,
and very slow breeding cycles really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for this reason, animal breeders have
been more focused on quantitative
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quantitative genetic approaches to their
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like project testing, estimation of
breeding values, mixed model analysis,
[SPEAKER_04]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been sort of the routine work for
animal breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas plant breeding has sort of drifted
more and more into the hands of
[SPEAKER_04]: agronomists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly, you know, as I said,
extensive field testing, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least in Europe that has become,
plant breeding has become a job for
[SPEAKER_04]: agronomists to a large extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many agronomists do not have solid
statistical training, at least not in
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So genetic knowledge has been,
has played a second role here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: second fiddle in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think is one reason why suddenly
when the genomic selection bomb explodes
[SPEAKER_04]: in the face of plant breeders,
I don't really know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're not really trained to
think in those terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also, at least from my experience,
working now almost 15 years in practical
[SPEAKER_04]: plant breeding, there are other reasons
which are more emotional than rational
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to accepting things like
genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is something I call the cultural
psychology of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if you Google plant breeder
and you look at your imagery, you
[SPEAKER_04]: typically find something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a typical plant breeder,
you know, someone looking in the field or
[SPEAKER_04]: in the greenhouse, looking intensely at
the crop, in the case of a barley head.
[SPEAKER_04]: That image is exactly, or not very far
removed from the image you can see in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1912, 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though at that time it was mostly men
who looked intensely at something in this
[SPEAKER_04]: case.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how many people facing Europe
tend to think about plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nowadays I think this is the modern
day plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just last week hired a person,
a plant breeder, to sit in front of the
[SPEAKER_04]: computer most of the time and develop
prediction models.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the first plant breeder in
our company that will not have to wear
[SPEAKER_04]: boots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a cultural shift here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least in my experience,
there are plant breeders that have a hard
[SPEAKER_04]: time accepting this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's just finish by giving you some
quick examples from how we built up the
[SPEAKER_04]: oak breeding program using genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't go into the most secret details
here, but I will try to give you an idea
[SPEAKER_04]: at least of how we were thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had this Oats 2.0, the old school
breeding, traditional breeding setup where
[SPEAKER_04]: we had early generations in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I walked up and down here and
selected the best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I thought were the best ones
turned out they were not the best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did the yield trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was evidently inefficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had what I call the low information
content, by which I mean that we didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really learn very much by walking up and
down this field from year to year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we replaced those early generation with
greenhouse grown single seed propagated
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we genotype every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we based our selection on predicted
phenobytes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were able to go from cross to field
trials to what you see on the right in
[SPEAKER_04]: three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in year one, we did the cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: In year three, we had the field trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we still do the field trials because
one, we have to validate our predictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, the final test will always be a
phenotypic test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we use the information from the
field trials to update our prediction
[SPEAKER_04]: model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's continuous updating our model by
using the yield trials, which means that
[SPEAKER_04]: we also put bad stuff in the things lines
we know will never become a variety we put
[SPEAKER_04]: in the yield trials because we need the
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is one example.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now one or two years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: The accuracy of predicted yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the Y axis, the vertical axis,
you have predicted grain yield in the F4.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the image to the left, you will see
the F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is where in that material we did the
prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two years later, we had the F8
population in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could compare the predicted
phenotypes, the predicted yield with the
[SPEAKER_04]: observed yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had what we think a pretty good
correlation here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost per line of genotyping was at
that time $25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting to compare to this
graph on your left-hand side now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, in that graph, you have the
observed grain yield in the F8 of the X
[SPEAKER_04]: axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Y axis, you have instead the
observed grain yield the year before in
[SPEAKER_04]: the very same lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the accuracy of what we can call a
phenotypic prediction and the accuracy of
[SPEAKER_04]: a genomic prediction are well,
they're the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're equally good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that the phenotypic prediction costs
six times as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you cannot do it until much later in
the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the breeder's prediction
was zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty useless.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can we predict?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can predict the number of traits here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those traits that I couldn't predict,
we can now predict with markers instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, you see a variation in the
prediction accuracy between different
[SPEAKER_04]: traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that probably has to do with the
genetics of those traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some traits we get very good, strong,
accurate prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That concept, for example, which is more
or less impossible to see in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the eye, we can predict with a high
probability or high accuracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, these are some examples from
spring wheat, which is bread, a crop that
[SPEAKER_04]: we breed for baking quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And baking quality is something that's
built up of many different sub-traits
[SPEAKER_04]: because they dow a yield of bread volume,
a gluten index, a falling number,
[SPEAKER_04]: sedimentation, and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely impossible to observe in
the field with an eye, which we can now
[SPEAKER_04]: predict using markers instead.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a good enough accuracy, we think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, everything we did was very
home-cooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it up ourselves more or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been corroborated in many
studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one example of a big study in
wheat or a global study in wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has shown that you can predict a
large number of traits with very good
[SPEAKER_04]: accuracy between around 0.5, 0.6 for many
even complex traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not what we see in our breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an artifact.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wheat or gluten.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need this sort of evidence to be able
to convince our readers, the more
[SPEAKER_04]: traditionally minded ones, that genomic
selection is actually very, very
[SPEAKER_04]: promising.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I just want to mention that we
can also work on predicting crosses,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the old school plant breeding,
in plant breeding 2.0, cross prediction,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means which parent shall I combine?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which mom shall I cross with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which dad?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much up to breeder
guesswork.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have two high-yielding parents,
for example, but you wouldn't know if they
[SPEAKER_04]: had complementary yield alleles or genes
or if they had the same ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had the same ones, there would be
no points in crossing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had complementary ones,
there would be a point in crossing them,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you could have zucombinase and
transgressive segregation in the
[SPEAKER_04]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why you do hundreds and
hundreds of crosses each year is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: simply don't really know which ones to
cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has even become a bit of a status among
plant breeders, saying, I do 500 crosses
[SPEAKER_04]: each year.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you then only do 300 crosses each year,
you're sort of saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you think about it, we release
maybe one or two new oak varieties each
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the merit of those varieties is due to
genetics, then it is in principle
[SPEAKER_04]: predictable, knowable, which crosses we
should make.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be sufficient for doing just one
or two crosses each year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to increase the knowability or the
predictability of crosses that we use by
[SPEAKER_04]: stimulating crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, we could do about a couple of
hundred lines, a couple of hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: combinations, and a couple of hundred
progeny per combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have some maybe 10,000 or 50,000
offspring, like the ones in the rows in
[SPEAKER_04]: the field I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be evaluated by visual
inspection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, we can simulate to do the
crossing in silico with grass as an
[SPEAKER_04]: example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have here 3,500, something like that,
lines with snip data.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gives you about six million pairwise
combinations that you can do in silico,
[SPEAKER_04]: not in reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have simulated 500 offspring per
combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each dot you see is mean value of 500
offspring to six million crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have evaluated around three billion
offspring for a number of trades here,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the trades that we have prediction
models for, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the grass, you have on the x-axis here,
yield, and on the y-axis, you have the
[SPEAKER_04]: volume weight, for example, two important
trades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you can select which crosses you want
to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, in this particular example,
you have to do some trade-off between
[SPEAKER_04]: yield and volume weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just up to your priorities,
which crosses you want to make here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does give you the possibility of doing
billions of crosses in the computer before
[SPEAKER_04]: you actually do them in reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: The consequence of this development from
the implementation of dynamic prediction
[SPEAKER_04]: models in breeding has led us to
structuring our plant breeding in a way
[SPEAKER_04]: that is more animal breeding-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have divided the four, I can say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant breeding 2.0 is what you see on the
right-hand side here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The typical pedigree breeding program
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you are building up a process to do
what the animal breeders do, the
[SPEAKER_04]: population improvement part, which is the
rapid cycling and prediction selection
[SPEAKER_04]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cross, you predict, you select,
you cross, you predict, you select very
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you combine that with speed breeding
techniques, growing your plant growth
[SPEAKER_04]: chambers under very controlled
circumstances, you can have four up to six
[SPEAKER_04]: generations a year, which means that you
can reduce your breeding cycle even to
[SPEAKER_04]: below a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that cycle, from that wheel,
we extract that line to go into the
[SPEAKER_04]: ordinary traditional yield trials for the
final selection of varieties, but also to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide data for the prediction models.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now at Lansman we have actually
organized ourselves in two groups that we
[SPEAKER_04]: call variety development groups that are
populated mostly by agronomists and they
[SPEAKER_04]: work with all our different crops and they
do the field trials and they do the final
[SPEAKER_04]: selection of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have one group, which we call the
population improvement group, which is now
[SPEAKER_04]: where statistical geneticists work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they spend their time doing prediction
models basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am heading that group right now and
we are so many people, but we are sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: hiring more people over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: As more and more of our crops fit into
this scheme, we will work more and more on
[SPEAKER_04]: population improvement for this two-part
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be a bit, take some big words in my
mouth, I can see that I think the genomic
[SPEAKER_04]: prediction is really the grand unicorn
theory of genetic improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that you have to cross
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not sort of in your crop silo any
longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not an oat expert or wheat expert
or barley expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can work across crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even work across the plant-animal
divide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a lot more people, statistical
geneticists, bioinformaticians,
[SPEAKER_04]: people like that, I think have a bright
future in both animal and plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, that's very exciting and very
promising for the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to say today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can open up the floor for questions now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wish, you can put your questions in
the chat box or you can just raise your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand and speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alf, I had a question about plant manna.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you work on several crops,
but do you typically have just one breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: per crop or do you often have more than
one breeder per crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have mostly one breeder per crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: In wheat, for example, we have one spring
wheat and one winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's two wheat breeders, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have two barley breeders as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, there are typically one
breeder per crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many testing stations do you have
in Sweden and in Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: In Sweden, we have, well, first of all,
we have our own station, breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: stations, and we have Sweden is not a very
big country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have three breeding stations that we
own in Sweden and one breeding station
[SPEAKER_04]: that we own in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we sort of use service providers
for other locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have in Oates, for example,
we have, I think, some 15 to 20 locations
[SPEAKER_04]: across Europe, and we have five or six
locations in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure exactly to the other
crops how many they have, but something
[SPEAKER_04]: similar, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try not to own too much land,
but we try to buy services instead from,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, trial service providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question about seed increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing a bunch of cycles by
single seed descent in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: how then do you move quickly from the
single seed or the spike or the panicle if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing oats, how do you move from
that to enough seed to plant out a yield
[SPEAKER_00]: plot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that done in the greenhouse or is that
done with a summer season or a counter
[SPEAKER_00]: season nursery?
[SPEAKER_04]: Combination, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we harvest the final single seed
generation, we plant that in the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse, in the soil, in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do some kind of hill plots in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the final single seed descent
generation is harvested in February,
[SPEAKER_04]: March.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant is from greenhouse hill plots in
April.
[SPEAKER_04]: We harvest them in August, we send them to
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the year after, we can get enough seed
back to plant yield trials at six
[SPEAKER_04]: locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had good experience with New Zealand
seed increases as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten up to 100 to one seed
increase in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any problems with seed
dormancy when you're trying to turn over
[SPEAKER_02]: generations in your greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we haven't had that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, there are a couple of questions now
in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are a couple of questions in
the chat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Nick Morales, it says, thanks for the
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the genotyping done in-house and how
many SNPs do you generally work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, the genotyping is a service
that we buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with a chip that has about we
typically get about 5,000 or so
[SPEAKER_04]: polymorphous nets, even though there are
more on the chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are building up now a capacity to work
in-house with genotyping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would move to in-house genotyping,
which would probably be some kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: sequence-based genotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question from John Luke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yannick, thank you for this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still in a phase where you are
rapidly evolving your breeding schemes in
[SPEAKER_02]: response to the new prediction
opportunities or do you feel that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching a new equilibrium?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're definitely in equilibrium,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we started in 2014 with genomic
selection, it was as a way of doing
[SPEAKER_04]: early-generation selection, as I tried to
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then, we have moved more and more to
cross-section and trying very hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: reduce the breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can accept, I mean, if you have a
very fast breeding cycle, you can accept
[SPEAKER_04]: the lower prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the oat breeding program is
beginning to mature a bit now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have other crops that are more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the forage crops and the hybrids
and the clonal crops and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not as far with the oats and the
spring wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know how those breeding
programs will look in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Luke also asked, are you worried
about loss of genetic diversity with rapid
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we are concerned with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to keep an eye on that,
of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you don't lose genetic
variation, you should be worried,
[SPEAKER_04]: because then your selection is not
efficient enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, if you have very efficient
selection, you will lose genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to replenish that somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we have really settled
our mind exactly on how that should be
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to carry out simulations and
trials and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're experimenting quite a lot here,
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's how we learn also.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we are getting short on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we'll wrap it up there,
Alf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to thank you very much for
your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And please give my regards to Pernilla
Wallenbach.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those in the audience, Pernilla
