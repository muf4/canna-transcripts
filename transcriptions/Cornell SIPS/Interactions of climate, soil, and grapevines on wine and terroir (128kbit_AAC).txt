[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Don, for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, people in Geneva who are connected
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my talk is about terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people think that terroir is a
myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it myth or reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try to give a
definition of terroir, which is not easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because terroir is quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many different factors
dealing with terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see that terroir is all
about interactions, interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: the vine and the environment, the vine and
the climate, and the vine and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can extract some key factors
dealing with terroir and try how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure them and quantify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir also has a spatial component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir is about origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And origin has a boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there can be variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spatial variability is very important
when you're doing research on terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you know all this, well,
then you will see that it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so difficult to optimize terroir
expression and manage terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're first going to look at if terroir
is reality or myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will just show a few statements on
terroir that some people made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that terroir is a
religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either a believer or you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another statement which you read very much
in popular books about wine growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily scientific books,
but most popular books about wine growing
[SPEAKER_00]: state that terroir is about old vines
extending deep roots into deep layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vines pick up minerals from deeper
layers, which by some mystery are
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed into aromas, which give the
minerality to the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wine grown on slate should smell like
slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers, particularly in the New
World, believe that terroir is
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly protectionism from those who
believe that they have, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the Old World growers,
against those who are supposed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old World producers are wrong to believe
that they're the only ones to have
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir, because if terroir is about
origin, a New World vine also have an
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New World producers, I believe that
they are wrong, that terroir is just
[SPEAKER_00]: protectionism of European growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the nicest one I've heard,
and there's a very serious one,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this from an Australian researcher
who's called Peter Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing research on irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why his name is Peter Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a conference, something like 10
years ago, I asked him what he thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, terroir, that's just
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so of course, my purpose is to make
you a believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I take you to Burgundy to turn you
into a believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know if terroir is a
reality or not, and I should have done
[SPEAKER_00]: this with Peter Dry, but I just had the
time to take him there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one day, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a believer in terroir,
you just have to go to Burgundy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For historical reasons, in Burgundy,
the growers owe plots over different
[SPEAKER_00]: villages, different appalachians in
different locations on the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically grow all their
vineyards exactly the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have high density plantations,
10,000 vines per hectare, vertical shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: positioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinot Noir for red, Chardonnay for white,
same root stock everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the vineyards are trained in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make the wine also in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put the grapes into an open top
fermenter and punch down the skins with
[SPEAKER_00]: their feet, be it basic Burgundy or a
Grand Cru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, they turn out to have
10 or 12 or 15 different wines,
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from 5 euros a bottle to 10s of
euros and sometimes 100s of euros a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just because those blocks are
located different parts of the slopes in
[SPEAKER_00]: different villages that the wines are so
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go into the cellar and you
taste these wines, and then you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a believer, because these wines are so
different that there is something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the origin which makes the wine taste
different depending on the place where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, this is not science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a few examples from New
World places where, without going into
[SPEAKER_00]: science, you can see that terroir is
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the first terroir wine from
the New World was made in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's called Marta's Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you know this wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the top wines from Napa
Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is grown by the Heights family.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Heights family, they made a very
good Cabernet Sauvignon, and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: their own vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were buying purchasing grapes
from other growers, and they made a blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good Cabernet Sauvignon blend,
which was quite famous in the late 1960s
[SPEAKER_00]: or early 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they owned two blocks,
and one was called Marta's Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the winemaker every year said,
well, the wine from this block is so good,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pity to blend it into the Cabernet
Sauvignon blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why shouldn't we bottle it separately and
sell it for a higher price?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the salespeople completely
agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, this is great, because then we
have a top wine, and we limited number of
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles, and we can sell it for a higher
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started to make wine from this
particular block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what a terroir wine is,
a specified origin with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions of soil and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Marta's Vineyard was the first terroir
wine from the New World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they made it, I don't know
whether it was in the late 60s or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 1970s, they didn't realize that they
were making a terroir wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is very often the case which
appeared in the New World or in the Old
[SPEAKER_00]: World, if people make terroir wine,
it's just to make more profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you make wine from specific
locations and your wine is something
[SPEAKER_00]: special and you can sell it for a higher
price, that's a good way to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people make terroir wines just to make
more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no science involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no scientists going to Marta's
Vineyard and tell the owners that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science generally comes afterwards to
explain why in some places the wine is
[SPEAKER_00]: different and the wine is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, I went on pilgrimage
to Marta's Vineyard a few years ago and I
[SPEAKER_00]: took this nice picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when terroir is reality, we should be
able to make a definition of terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now many, many people try to give a
definition of terroir, but it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because generally, if you try to make a
definition of terroir based on one
[SPEAKER_00]: discipline, the definition is not very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people tried to make a
definition from their own discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: A geologist, and I don't know if you know
this book, Terroir, by a geologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: an American geologist who is called
Wilson, James Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the book is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the geology of wine growing
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one thing which is wrong with
this book is the title, because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: about terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about geology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And geographers also tried to define
terroir based on geomorphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the slopes that make what's special
in wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientists drew up very nice soil maps
and then called it terroir maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are soil maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not terroir maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climatologists try to define climate zones
for growing specific wine types and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: define terroir from a climatologist's
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they talk about climatology and not
about terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a famous French soil
microbiologist, which is called Claude
[SPEAKER_00]: Bourguignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thinks he deals with terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, he's studying soil
microbiology and not terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's nothing wrong with all these
approaches, but they're not really about
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dealing with some specific factors
dealing with terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the most important thing
these people forget is that the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: should always be in the center of a
terroir study.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot explain terroir just by geology
or soil types or soil microbiology or
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to integrate the vine and see how
the vine interacts with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years ago, I assisted to a
conference and there was a geographer from
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand speaking, Warren Moran,
and he had a statement which I liked very,
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, we are all victims of our own
discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these guys, they are a little bit
victim of their own discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terroir is clearly disciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A definition I liked very much about
terroir is a very simple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir is a sense of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember where I heard that,
but I like it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you taste the wine and there is
something special about that place,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's a terroir wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more complete definition was given by a
Professor Sugan from Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably the first one in the world
to study seriously terroir on a scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he defined terroir as an interactive,
cultivated ecosystem in a given place,
[SPEAKER_00]: including climate, soil, and the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like very much the idea of an
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ecosystem is living beings interacting
with their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our situation, it's the vine
interacting with its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, human factors are involved
because it's not a natural system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a cultivated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man takes management choices which
impact, of course, on the final result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the human factor is also very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this human factor has an historical
dimension because generally people figured
[SPEAKER_00]: out what are the right varieties in their
climatic situation on their soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the right rootstocks,
which are the right training systems by
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes old wine growing regions can
have some advantage in terms of terroir,
[SPEAKER_00]: not because they have more terroir,
but they have a little bit more experience
[SPEAKER_00]: in managing their terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science generally explains terroir,
but only afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that scientists go into the
field and say, you should plant vines
[SPEAKER_00]: there because there's something special in
the soil and the climate that will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: great terroir wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where science also can help is to optimize
terroir expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know all the factors that are
important in terroir expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: then science can help to optimize the
terroir expression by specific management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you that terroir is about
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can extract among all these
interactions some which are more important
[SPEAKER_00]: than others in the final result.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this talk, I extracted three which I
think are really sort of pillars in
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the timing of phenology,
which depends on the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the warmer the climate,
the earlier the phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends also on your soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have warm soils or cool soils,
and on the vine, particularly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second pillar in terroir expression is
water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in water status, water status is about
the interaction between the vine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate, rainfall, evapotranspiration,
but also between the vine and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among minerals that the vines are
picking up from the soil, nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the most important one because it
affects very much vigor and yield and also
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, let's have a look at the timing
of phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious that climate is an important
factor in terroir expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you try to define the ideal climate
for grape growing, it's just impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot give the optimum temperature
range or the optimum amount of rainfall to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a high quality wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply, if you look at where grape vines
are grown in the world, they are grown at
[SPEAKER_00]: different places with different climatic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape vines are obviously made in
Bordeaux, but also in Burgundy,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the climate is much cooler,
and also in California, where the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: is much warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there does not seem to be an optimum
temperature range for growing high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the climate alone,
it's impossible to define the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: climate conditions for growing grape
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, what's important are the
interactions between the climate and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grape vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, we have to put the grape
vine back in the center of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a statement made by two famous
Bordeaux oenologists, which were the
[SPEAKER_00]: directors of the Faculty of Oenology in
the 1950s and 1960s in Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people can be considered as the
founders of the modern, of the oenology
[SPEAKER_00]: school of Bordeaux, Jean Ribéreau-Gaillon
and Emile Penaud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their handbook about oenology,
I extracted this sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote in the 1960s that in a given
region, the best wines are obtained from
[SPEAKER_00]: fine grape vine varieties that just
achieve full ripeness under the local
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic conditions, as if a quick
ripening would burn the flavors that
[SPEAKER_00]: account for the finesse of grape vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you translate that in a little bit
more modern language, you can say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, to make high quality vines,
grapes must attain full ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot make grape vines with unripened
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have green flavors, too much
acidity and too low sugar in the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it's very important
also to consider that grapes should not
[SPEAKER_00]: ripen too early in the season,
because if you ripen the fruit very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, particularly in warm conditions,
say, for instance, in July or in August,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's just like growing tomatoes in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapes will be lacking acid,
so the wines will lack freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But particularly, there will be very
little aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get much more aromas if the end of the
ripening is happening at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season in cool conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing of the ripeness is very,
very important in terroir expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not be too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither too late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the northern hemisphere,
more or less the right window for ripening
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes is between the 10s of September and
the 10s of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're after that, there's a big risk
that your grapes will never ripen and you
[SPEAKER_00]: will have green flavor in your wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ripen much earlier, say in August,
then your grapes will ripen very quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: and your grapes would lack aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ripening window is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you look at European Appalachians,
in European Appalachians, people defined
[SPEAKER_00]: the grapevine varieties they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Bordeaux, you cannot grow
any grapevine variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're restricted to a list of seven or
eight varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Burgundy, it's even more
restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Tuscany, it's also
restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are these varieties so restricted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because by trial and error,
people have figured out which varieties in
[SPEAKER_00]: their condition ripen in the right
temperature window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest is always between the 10s of
September and the 10s of October,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to the Mosel, to Alsace,
to Burgundy, to Bordeaux, to La Rioja,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Tuscany, up south to Alicante,
where they grow very late ripening
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, which is called Monastrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest is always in that right ripening
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow Pinot Noir in Bordeaux,
then Bordeaux is no longer a great terroir
[SPEAKER_00]: because Pinot Noir would ripen in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow Cabernet Sauvignon in
Burgundy, Burgundy is no longer a great
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir because your Cabernet Sauvignon
will never ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that equation between the timing of
your variety and your climatic conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important to grow terroir wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, not all wines in the world
are terroir wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can also make varietal wines and
not dealing with the origin, but focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the grapevine variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that generally happens when people are
planting grapes in new wine growing
[SPEAKER_00]: regions where they don't have a lot of
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, OK, we like Burgundy wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Burgundies are made with Chardonnay,
so let's plant Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't look at their climatic
conditions if they are similar to Burgundy
[SPEAKER_00]: and if Chardonnay is the right choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many new wine growing regions,
people plant rather early ripening
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties in warm conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the case in the south of
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the case in California,
in Napa, where they replanted a lot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They planted a lot of Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Chardonnay will ripen in
those regions or Pinot Noir or Chardonnay
[SPEAKER_00]: will ripen in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the grapes lack flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still can make good wine, but then you
need a lot of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ferment the Chardonnay in oak
barrels, you let them age on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make a malelectic fermentation,
have some nice diacetyl produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: malelectic fermentation, then you get
flavor in your wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the flavor from the
Chardonnay grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the flavor from a technological
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you no longer make terroir wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making wines more based on
technology, which can be sound wines,
[SPEAKER_00]: good wines, but they are not terroir
wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to have a Chardonnay,
a terroir wine from Chardonnay,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Chablis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chablis is a very cool climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chardonnay is really at the limit of
its ripening condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chardonnay ripens in the last days of
September or early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a lot of aromas from
Chardonnay in your Chablis wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Sauvignon Blanc, for instance,
if you pick up a Chardonnay from South
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, which ripens in February,
then you get no Chardonnay flavor in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to oak it very much and have a
malelectic fermentation to get aromas in
[SPEAKER_00]: your wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Marlborough, where Chardonnay
ripens very late in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: in April, sometimes even early May,
which corresponds to early November in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Hemisphere, then you have a lot
of aromas from Sauvignon Blanc in your
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to be on the limit
of your ripening conditions to make
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to optimize terroir expression,
if the climate is warm, choose late
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Napa, they understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they had Phylloxera in the 1990s,
they pulled up all their Chardonnay and
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced it by Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cabernet Sauvignon is ripening in Napa
at the end of September or early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make a terroir wine with
Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you cannot make a terroir wine from
Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Cabernet Sauvignon, you can make a
terroir wine in Napa, but not with
[SPEAKER_00]: Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to grow early ripening
varieties, and there are many nice
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored varieties among the early
ripening varieties, and you have to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for cool climate sites, like Carneros,
which is closer to the bay from San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate is much cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you get aromas in your Pinot
Noir and in your Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already gave the example of Sauvignon
Blanc from Marlborough.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Pinot Noir, there's a very nice place
in New Zealand, which is central to Otago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the snow on the mountains,
very cool conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make great Pinot Noir with a lot
of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about the timing of phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first point, which is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second point, which is important to make
wines expressing terroir, is the water
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you look at all the great
wines produced around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly for red wines,
the best wines are always made under water
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water deficit is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happens when vines meet water
deficit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably all know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoot grows, stops early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this slide, here you
have the water potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you go to the left side,
the lower the water potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the more water deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have the day of the year that
the shoots stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quite good correlation between
the day the shoots stop growing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: water deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water deficit, the earlier the
shoots stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have the same sort of correlation
for berry size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the correlation between water
potentials and berry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get small berries when vines are
grown under water deficit conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get lower malic acid, which simply
means that your grapes are ripener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good correlation between water
deficit and malic acid in the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the opposite correlation with
entocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water deficit, the higher the
entocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know all that if you want to grow
high quality reds, then you need shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cessation around or before
veraison, small berries, low malic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and high entocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that to grow high quality
reds, you need water deficit, which does
[SPEAKER_00]: not mean severe stress, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, vine water status depend on climate,
rainfall, potential evapotranspiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the vine, some root stocks are more
resistant to draw than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The varieties, some varieties are more
resistant to draw than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on management practices, leaf area,
the bigger your leaf area, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop load, vineyard floor management,
you can create competition for water
[SPEAKER_00]: between cover crop and the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if your conditions are too
dry, you can irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third pillar of terroir expression are
soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, most of the minerals the
vines pick up from the soil have not a
[SPEAKER_00]: decisive effect on the composition of the
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangely enough, one could imagine that
iron or potassium or magnesium or calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever would have a big impact on
grape composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, many studies have been
carried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these minerals only have marginal
effect on grape composition, except
[SPEAKER_00]: situations of clear access and severe
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those extremes are never good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you are in a reasonable range for
these minerals, the impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of the grapes and the quality
of the wine is not decisive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen really has a big impact on vine
vigor, on shoot growth, and on grape
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some results from a trial we
carried out also some time ago at Chateau
[SPEAKER_00]: Léo Villescaze, which is one of the most
famous estates from Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a network of plots,
and I only showed results from three
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks, at Léo Villescaze to study why
some blocks produce better wines than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in many situations where we measured
the impact of the soil on the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of the grapes and the quality of
the wines, it turned out that water was
[SPEAKER_00]: the decisive factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it happened to be that we were at Léo
Villescaze in 1997, which was a very rainy
[SPEAKER_00]: vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this rainy vintage, there was no
water deficit whatsoever on any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks, because it just rained all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were big variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed there were big variations in
nitrogen status just because of different
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some blocks were very low in nitrogen,
some were medium high, and some were high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is yeast-available nitrogen,
which responds very well to the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen that's available in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we noticed that if nitrogen was
low, which was the case for this block,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pruning weight was lower,
yield was lower, berry weight was smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: acidity was lower, and there was more
sugar, more anthocyanins, and the ratings
[SPEAKER_00]: for the wine, we made wine by
micro-minifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, with the low nitrogen in the
grapes, the quality was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, low nitrogen does not mean
severe deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, severe nitrogen deficiency is
not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for making growing red wine,
it's better to be a little bit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower end of nitrogen status than on the
high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will reduce your vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly in wet conditions where
water is not limiting, nitrogen can be
[SPEAKER_00]: another limiting factor, which slows your
shoot growth, which reduces berry size,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces vigor, reduces yields,
and promotes the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins and tannins in your grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whites, it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to make white wine, you don't want
tannins in your grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many aroma compounds respond
positively to nitrogen, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the case for volatile fuels,
which are involved in the aroma of many
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, like Sauvignon Blanc,
Riesling, Sémillon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we studied the precursors of
volatile fuels in grapes under low
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen conditions and conditions where
we added nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these precursors were very much
boosted by nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tannins were reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly the same response as in
reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference between reds and whites
is that in reds, you want tannins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in whites, you do not want tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in whites, it's better to be a little
bit on the high side with nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does not mean excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have really excess
nitrogen, it will promote botrytis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not good in reds and not good in
whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing of phenology, water,
and nitrogen are essential factors in
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how can we measure these?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing of phenology depends very
much on climatic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to have a good insight in
climatic conditions on your estate,
[SPEAKER_00]: where climate is very easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put down a weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure temperatures, which will
be a driving factor for phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure the rainfall, which have
an impact on the water status of your
[SPEAKER_00]: vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can measure potential
evapotranspiration, which is when you make
[SPEAKER_00]: a water balance, potential
evapotranspiration has as much impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: the final result as has rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, people forget about
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they compare climatic situations,
generally people compare rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, in this area, we have so
much rainfall, in this area, so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also important to take into
account potential evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar radiation is also important for
photosynthesis, and particularly for color
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you that the timing of phenology
is very important to grow high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, you can go into the fields
and measure phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also predict it by
phenological models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these phenological models can help you
to choose the varieties which are most
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to your local situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most situations, people have figured
out which are the right varieties in their
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic conditions by trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people plant grapes in a new area,
they will try dozens of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they will end up after one or two
generations saying, oh, for this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the right variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do it a little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save time and money by using
phenological models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because phenological models are often
quite simple models because the main
[SPEAKER_00]: driving factor in phenology is
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other factors involved,
but the main factor is temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature is easy to model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenology can be predicted with
process-based models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use the temperature as input data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few examples of very old
models which are very much used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Winkler model, which is a temperature
sum base of 10 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hügeling model, which is slightly more
complex, but not very complex either,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very much used in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some research on phenology
modeling because we think we thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: these existing models could be improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when Winkler made his model,
his temperature model, he used only
[SPEAKER_00]: phenology data from Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't have a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hügeling was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he made his model, he had mainly
phenology data from the Kolmar Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Station in Alsace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was from Alsace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't have a computer because it
was in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, we believe that phenological
models can be improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using more data, and by just using
computational power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started to think about the new
phenological model, we started to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: phenology data.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two or three years, we just were
collecting phenology data from different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we managed to collect over 4,000
phenology observations from 123 locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 varieties, and spanning over 48
vintages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborated with a phenology modeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's quite famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has several papers in Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she made a phenology modeling
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this phenology modeling platform,
you put your phenology data, you put your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature data, and you can test a whole
range of models, and then fit your models
[SPEAKER_00]: with your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also very careful about the
quality of the meteor data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only used phenology observations
when we had the meteor data from located
[SPEAKER_00]: at less than five kilometers from the
plot, and less than 100 meters in
[SPEAKER_00]: altitude, to be sure that the temperature
data was representative for the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created a model, which we called
Grapevine Flowering Vorazen model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to create this model, we tested
several types of models, linear models,
[SPEAKER_00]: or beta models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested other models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the result, I have no time to
go into details, but surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the result was that the linear models gave
results that were almost as good,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes even better, than the more
complex models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we chose the simple models,
because it's also very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer these models to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easier they are to use,
the more chance you have to transfer them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this modeling came out that the
best models were linear models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just had to fix the base temperature
and the day from which you count,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start counting your temperature sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And surprisingly, for base temperature,
very low base temperatures turned out to
[SPEAKER_00]: be much better than the generally existing
phenology models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was assumed that the base temperature
for vines is 10 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these temperature summations take out
10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we got better results from
low temperature threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even chose a threshold of 0 degree
Celsius, because just in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, the closer the efficiency to
1, the better the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root mean squared error is the error of
prediction in days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eight days, if you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we increase the base temperature,
the worse the prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the time we start to count the
temperature sum, we tested several days,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting at the 1st of January or several
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the best result was that day
of the year 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Grapevine Flowering-Verazen model
is a very simple model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a summation of daily average
temperature that starts counting at the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st of March on the northern hemisphere,
day of the year 60, with a base
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of 0 degree centigrade,
which makes that it remains very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we had to prove that it was
better than existing models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we compared it to the growing degree
model from Winkler, which starts to count
[SPEAKER_00]: at day one, 1st of January, with a base
temperature of 10 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for flowering, there was not much
difference in terms of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two models were very, very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for verazen, the prediction with the
GFV model is much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of efficiency, it's 0.72 compared
to 0.14 for the Winkler model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of precision of prediction,
the GFV model predicts verazen with an
[SPEAKER_00]: error of seven to eight days, whereas the
GDD model predicts it with an error of
[SPEAKER_00]: about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We validated, of course, the model on 20%
of the data set, and we got very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: curves in terms of flowering or for
verazen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more scatter, of course,
of verazen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work was published in the
Australian Journal of Grape and Wine
[SPEAKER_00]: Research, a paper published in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step was to classify for
precocity a large number of varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had data from approximately 100
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these varieties were classified for
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from early ripening varieties to late
ripening varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have simply the temperature
sum calculated with the GFV model to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict flowering, and we did the same
thing for verazen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was published in Agriculture and
Forest Metrology last year, and we are now
[SPEAKER_00]: working on ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step is ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have the error bars for the
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, for the major varieties,
we have very small error bars because we
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for more obscure varieties,
where we sometimes we had only three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, or five data points, the error bar
can be quite substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get more data, we can improve the
prediction for the varieties in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting the error bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we measure water status?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will go quite quickly because you
are familiar with these techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe that you should measure
water status of the vines on the vines and
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing my PhD measuring it in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no time to talk about that,
but I think it's much more efficient to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the water status straight on the
vine than to measure it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started working with water
potentials in 1990, and I still believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's a great, great tool for
monitoring water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very popular among growers just
because you have to go into the field with
[SPEAKER_00]: your pressure chamber and do the
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, growers or vineyard managers,
they prefer to stay in their office and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the computer data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up to now, it's not yet possible to
optimize the water potential measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe one day, Alan, it will be
possible to monitor the water potential
[SPEAKER_00]: directly and have the data coming on your
computer in your office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last 25 years, we've
accumulated a lot of data from water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, we focus on stem water
potential and pre-dawn leaf water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, also very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But leaf water potential, there's too much
influence of the climatic conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: the particular position of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, we no longer use leaf water
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use either stem water potential or
pre-dawn leaf water potential to assess
[SPEAKER_00]: the water status of the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you see curves of three
different vintages in Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't irrigate our vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the water states of the
vines can be very variable, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a dry vintage, 2005 was the
driest vintage ever recorded in Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water potentials can go very deep
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are stem water potentials going down
to almost minus 2 megapascal in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vines didn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even made very good vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2007, which was a very wet vintage,
stem water potentials remained in the
[SPEAKER_00]: range minus 0.6, minus 0.8 megapascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004 was a moderately dry vintage,
where water potentials dropped down to
[SPEAKER_00]: minus 1.2, minus 1.3 megapascal at the end
of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also monitor the water states of
the vine on different blocks in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in the 2005 vintage,
three blocks, gravelly soil with low water
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the water potential goes
down very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sandy soil with water table,
where the water potential does not go down
[SPEAKER_00]: too much because of the water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a clay soil with moderate water
deficit stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very fine tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To very precisely monitor the water status
of the vines over the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you irrigate,
it's also a very, very fine tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the best tool in the world to
monitor irrigation in vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is one drawback, is that you
have to go in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't like going into the field
to do measurements because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: constraining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another limitation, which is a
real limitation, is that you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor a limited number of blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you do pre-dawn leaf water
potential or stem water potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a limited time during the day that
you can do the measurement for pre-dawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two or three hours before dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the stem water potential, it's in just
after afternoon, in the early afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so depending on the distance between
your blocks, you can monitor five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, eight, or maximum 10 blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot monitor 50 blocks or 100 blocks
with this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of years ago, we were looking
for a technique where it was possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor the water states of the vines
without being limited in the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks that you could monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we adapted the method to vines,
which is based on discrimination of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotopes in grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the principle of this technique is
that ambient CO2, and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: stable isotopes and not carbon-14,
of course, not radioactive isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambient CO2 contains 98.9% of carbon-12
and 1.1% of carbon-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during photosynthesis, the enzymes
involved in transforming CO2 into sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: they prefer to pick up carbon-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the sugar produced by
photosynthesis, there's a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of carbon-12 than there is in
ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when vines meet water deficit stress,
the stomata close, and then there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 in the leaf, and the enzymes start to
pick up carbon-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's no more carbon-12,
they have to pick up carbon-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proportion of carbon-13 integrated
in sugars by photosynthesis increases with
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's completely proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer the stomata are closed,
the more carbon-13 will be integrated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sugar produced will end up in the
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if at the end of the ripening period,
you pick up a sample of grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it to a specialized lab for doing
stable isotope analysis, and you measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the proportion of carbon-13, the more
carbon-13 you have in your grape sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater the water deficit stress the
vines faced during grape ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an integrative tool to measure,
let's say, the average water deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: stress experienced by the vines from the
raisin to ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio of carbon-13, carbon-12,
which is called delta-13C, is expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: against the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those laboratories who analyze it,
they all have the same standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they compare the ratio with the
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have no time to go into details
how this calculation is done, but just
[SPEAKER_00]: retain that if the result is minus 27,
then it means that the stomata were open
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time, and there was no water
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the result is minus 20,
then the vines faced severe water deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, and the stomata were virtually
closed all the time from the raisin to
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this we published in 2002 in Journal of
Experimental Botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably more familiar with water
potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have the translation from,
for instance, stem water potential values
[SPEAKER_00]: with delta-13C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so minus 21 in water deficit would
correspond to a stem water potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: minus 1.4 megapascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several advantages of this
technique that it's easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you need specialized equipment,
but there are labs who are specialized in
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just send you grape juice,
and they make the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you an integrated measurement of
the wine water status during the ripening
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no more limitation in the
number of plots you can sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the price you have to pay,
which is about depending on the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples between $50 and $70 a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no limitation in the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 100 blocks and you want to
know the water states of your vines in 100
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks, you can sample 100 grape samples
and send them to the lab and have them
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very nice tool to validate
irrigation strategies afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people irrigate, if you want to do
quality irrigation for producing quality
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes, then you should maintain water
deficit, moderate water deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very difficult not to add too
much water, but to add enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very nice to have a tool that in
the end, you can say, OK, my irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to maintain moderate water
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just at the end of the season,
you pick up a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the minus, say, minus 23,
24 range, then your irrigation was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the result is minus 27, then you
irrigated too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the result is minus 21,
then you did not irrigate enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is not a tool for day-to-day
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have your hand on the tap and you
need to know if you should open the tap to
[SPEAKER_00]: water the vines or not, then this result,
of course, is coming too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can manage irrigation on a
day-to-day basis with stem-water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can validate your irrigation
strategy afterwards with delta-13C
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to do this in a terroir
trial where we compared the effect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, the climate, and the grapevine
variety on grape composition and wine
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to do these delta-13C
measurements on grape sugar in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were lucky to have four vintages,
1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, with very
[SPEAKER_00]: contrasting climatic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: 98 was a very dry vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a network of blocks, the average
delta-13C was minus 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000 was a wet vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average delta-13C was minus 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99, 97 were wet vintages, minus 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a very good statistical
separation from the vintages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also for the soils, we had three
soils in the network with different
[SPEAKER_00]: water-holding capacity, a very dry
gravelly soil where the average delta-13C
[SPEAKER_00]: was minus 22, a clay soil with moderate
water-holding capacity minus 23,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a sandy soil with a water-holding
capacity minus 24, a clay soil with
moderate water-holding capacity minus 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the water table within the
reach of the roots minus 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, with this technique, we managed
to separate very well the water status of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vines depending on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the grapevine varieties,
there was very little difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc,
and Merlot, which are the three major
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties we are growing in Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that the grapevine variety
had not a major effect on the water status
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water status was, in our
conditions, without irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly determined by the climate
conditions of the vintage and the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that in terms of
interpretation, whatever the variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thresholds are quite universal across
a wide range of variety, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, very practical for the
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to measure nitrogen status of the
vines?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy with plant-based
indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm a believer of plant-based
indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than soil-based indicators,
it's very difficult to get a good idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen status of vines by doing
measurements on soil samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in soil samples, you basically
analyze total nitrogen, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different than available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many organs on the vines
where you can measure nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all work pretty well for
assessing nitrogen status of the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, assessing nitrogen status of the
vine is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf blade analyzers work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petrile analyzers work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what works very well also is the
amount of nitrogen in your juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your nitrogen status is high,
then there's a lot of nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: must.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your nitrogen status is low,
then there's very little nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: must.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very good organ to sample
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it on canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at the color of the leaf
blades with the Minolta spot meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, in fact, measures the coloration of
your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works also very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these indicators work very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of yeast-available nitrogen
because people will analyze it anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they will analyze it to know if
their juice will ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one measurement, you know if your
juice will ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the vineyard manager, he knows
what is the nitrogen status of his vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can predict phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can measure vine nitrogen status.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this assessment has to account for
spatial variability, because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to know at one point what is the
precocity of your phenology, and what is
[SPEAKER_00]: your water status, and what is your
nitrogen status.
[SPEAKER_00]: But soils can be so variable that you're
not sure that 50 meters further in your
[SPEAKER_00]: field that the water status and nitrogen
status will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to account for that
spatial variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can this be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: For climate, a few weeks ago, you had
Benjamin Bois as a speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Benjamin did his PhD in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked together on the assessment
of the spatial variability of the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the wine-growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, because we are in Bordeaux,
we worked on data from Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we managed to identify 80 weather
stations with at least five years of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the data from these 80
weather stations, we created a spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: model for temperatures inside the Bordeaux
area, which not only used the data from
[SPEAKER_00]: these weather stations, but also
environmental co-variables, like altitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, distance from water masses,
distance from the sea, distance from the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a big forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also distance from the town of
Bordeaux, which is also a hot spot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we managed to make a very refined
mapping of temperatures all over Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the Médoc is a hot spot for
minimum temperatures, but not for maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pessac Léonyan, south of Bordeaux,
is cool for minimum temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: but warm for maximum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Saint-Emilion, which is here,
is warm for minimum temperatures and warm
[SPEAKER_00]: for maximum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very nice to know this spatial
variability, for instance, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt grapevine varieties to your
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in an ongoing research project,
we're trying to do the same variable
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of temperatures in a smaller
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Saint-Emilion area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put temperature sensors on vine
posts with data loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 100 points in the area,
we measure temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put these temperature sensors in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first year of complete data was
2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And already in 2012, if we compute the
Hoogling index, we see there are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: some differences over this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in such a small area,
Saint-Emilion Hoogling index ranges from
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 2,200 to almost 2,400, which is 200
degree days difference in such a small
[SPEAKER_00]: area, which is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still we have to figure out which are
the environmental cofactors which are
[SPEAKER_00]: driving these temperature variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, we will use the same
methodology as we used for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: border area with Benjamin-Bois,
but on a more refined scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: For phenology, once you know the
temperatures are driving phenology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once you know what is the spatial
variability of your temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can couple your temperature model
with the phenology model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can predict spatial
variability of phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a projection of veraison over
the Saint-Emilion area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how veraison progresses over
the area August 8, August 9, August 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: August 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes about one week for veraison to
be completed over the whole Saint-Emilion
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can predict spatial variability of
phenology over wine growing regions simply
[SPEAKER_00]: by coupling the temperature model with the
phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to leave, feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to do this quickly,
and I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for spatial variability of water
status, you can use Delta 13C.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, this is part of the
Chouvel Blanc vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a very good
correspondence between the soil type and
[SPEAKER_00]: the water deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the ranging from minus 22 to
minus 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use yeast available nitrogen if
you take enough samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have 10 samples per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make very refined maps of the
nitrogen status of the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the yeast available nitrogen
ranges from 60 to 200 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you an exact idea of the
variability of the nitrogen status over
[SPEAKER_00]: the estate, even with intra-block
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just define your grid of sampling,
the more precise map you will make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is simply interpolating yeast
available nitrogen data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you know all this, well,
management to optimize thereby expression
[SPEAKER_00]: is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use phenology models to choose the
variety that will right in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: window in your climatic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimize the level of water deficit if
your situation is very dry, you can either
[SPEAKER_00]: use drought resistant rootstocks or
drought resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can select soils with various soil
water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your climate is dry, then you can
compensate by choosing soils with high
[SPEAKER_00]: soil water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the opposite, if you are in a wet
situation where the risk is that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough water deficit, you can choose
a soil with low soil water holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do yield adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find phase water deficit,
they might be able to ripen two tons per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre, but not three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use irrigation if the
situation is too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with irrigation, you can only add
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot withdraw water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many situations, people lose
quality because they have too much water,
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough water deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think worldwide, you will lose as much
quality because of not enough water
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit and because of too much water
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To optimize the nitrogen status is even
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too low, just fertilize either by
mineral or by organic fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too high, you can use cover
crop to compete for nitrogen with the
[SPEAKER_00]: vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, terroir is a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to Burgundy, go to a cellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, you're very well received.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taste the vines from the barrels and
ask from which block they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, the vineyard management is the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winemaking techniques are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are differences, it's just
only because the plots are located in
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect of climate in soil can be
explained just by basic agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to look for some mystery
roots going very deep and minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming into aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about basic agronomy,
about temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir is about temperatures,
about phenology, about water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These factors can easily be quantified
even with their special variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the output data from these
measurements can be used to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir expression through adapted
management strategies, be it the choice of
[SPEAKER_00]: the right variety, the right root stock,
the use of cover crop or not, the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques to cope with your water status
or what so ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this was a very condensated talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running in Bordeaux a course on
terroir in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to have the same stuff
spread out over one week with more time
[SPEAKER_00]: for discussion, come to Bordeaux in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will have a little bit more
time to discuss about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you mentioned climate technology
and variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you kind of convinced me terroir is a
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the reality of climate change?
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of tiptoed around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder to what extent you see the
industry, for example, maybe thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about using your phenology model to
experiment with the ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening with the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of research now on climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no time to talk about it in my
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's obvious that if the timing of
phenology is so important in terroir
expression, that when temperatures are
rising, the timing of phenology will be
modified.
And this will profoundly affect terroir
expression.
Because the risk is that the varieties
will move out of the right behavior.
Which is, for instance, already happening
in Bordeaux with Sauvignon Blanc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sauvignon Blanc, for Bordeaux conditions,
early life in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: General harvest Sauvignon Blanc in between
the 7th of September and the 15th of
September.
And it's becoming more and more early.
In more vintages, you can harvest
Sauvignon Blanc at the end of August.
We're definitely not making our best
Sauvignon Blanc in those vintages.
So one possible adaptation to climate
change is simply to change the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: To find possibilities of delaying
varieties, particularly for early life
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, which can be either changing
the variety, or find any way to delay
[SPEAKER_01]: phenology.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, increasing thermohate,
or prune later, or using lower cycle
rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of possibilities.
But it's important to maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be very easy to model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in those phenology models,
you can just add one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four, five, six, seven, eight,
you can exactly see what is going to
happen if these or that variety will move
out of the right behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these tools are very adaptive to study
the impact of climate change, and to adapt
[SPEAKER_01]: the practices to maintain high quality
production in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another option is, of course, to move out
of the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just explained how it was important to
take into consideration the diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the water statue of each region in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you see in water irrigation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you respect your definition of the
terroids?
[SPEAKER_01]: For terroids, expression is optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, is it possible to
modify terroids' expression by adapting
[SPEAKER_01]: your irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good question.
So to optimize terroids' expression,
particularly for rats, provides a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of room for making high quality rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal situation is a situation of
moderate water density.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience in Bordeaux is that you can
quite far, far in terms of water density,
[SPEAKER_01]: still produce high quality rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who are familiar with water
potential measurements, in Bordeaux,
[SPEAKER_01]: we consider it quite optimal to have minus
1.3, minus 1.4, even minus 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is definitely, you have to take into
account your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you face quite severe water deficit
stress, you can still produce very high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality with moderate yield, but you
cannot combine severe water deficit stress
[SPEAKER_00]: with high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water deficit will impact photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photosynthesis is limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your minds are no longer able to write
with a free crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends also on your target in terms
of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your target is around two tons per
acre, then you can go quite far in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of water deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, irrigation will modify the
water states of your minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on where you are naturally
without irrigation in terms of water
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, if there are tourists who have
not enough water deficit, and have too
[SPEAKER_01]: much water stress, if your risk is that
you have not enough water deficit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in fact the case in many,
many wine growing regions around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, the point is that people are not
aware about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have not enough water
deficit to grow high quality grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your vines are looking very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are green, they produce, and then in
the end, the results are disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people do not connect it necessarily
to the problem of not enough water
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too much water deficit,
it's very easy to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your vines will, before they have the
grapes, will shrivel, it will be a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if the risk is that you have
too much water deficit stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: then irrigation is the only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can bring your vines back into
the right when you have water deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have not enough water deficit
stress, then irrigation is not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Geneva.
We have a question from Geneva.
We're going to have to wrap it up pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question from Geneva, Mark
Humburger, do the white wines show the
[SPEAKER_01]: same relation to water?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so definitely you need less water
deficit for whites than for reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because water deficit is very important to
have phenolics in your grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for red wine, you definitely need
phenolics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to have grapes with
high levels of phenolics without water
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for whites, you're more focusing on
the aroma compounds, and you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: too much phenolics in your grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely you should grow white grapes
with less water deficit than red grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can also be a very interesting
tool to optimize the terrarium expression
[SPEAKER_01]: in your vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because generally in an estate,
you have deep soils with high soil water
[SPEAKER_01]: holding capacity and shallow soils with
low water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you plant your reds on your shallow
soils and your whites on your deep soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you naturally will have less water
deficit on your whites and more water
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit on your reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very interesting way to optimize
the wine expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many people are doing it for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow their wines in their deep soils
with full water, and their reds on their
[SPEAKER_01]: gravity soils with shallow soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a very typical reason why it's why
our whites do really well here in our deep
[SPEAKER_04]: soils with a lot of water holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a much more structural advance.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I've been told we need to move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, we'll have to cut it out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have other questions,
we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
