[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am absolutely thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so exciting to have a chance to
talk about some of the work that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing recently since I left Cornell in
2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my first time back to campus
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many great memories come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just a thrill and an honor
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for inviting me and
having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Asian Turfgrass Research
Facility, 70 kilometers north of Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photo, you'll notice, was taken in
2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built this and maintained it and had
seven employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found, although we learned a lot
about turfgrass, it really wasn't a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good business, because this costs a lot of
money to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't really generate a lot of
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the four years that we have had the
Asian Turfgrass Center Research Facility
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2006 until 2009, I got a chance to
work with so many different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a chance to see how they
performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I travel around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see grasses in so many different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big area in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all different kinds of grasses
growing in the different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grass called broadleaf carpet
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in southern India at Kodai Canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kaikuyu grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the world's largest species of wild
cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a very strong animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they'd lumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they actually can jump very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extremely strong, just pure
muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, tigers don't attack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that they will take out a tiger
if a tiger would attack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kaikuyu grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a grass that's from, I believe,
the highlands of East Africa originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the same state in Coimbatore
and Tamil Nadu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have seashore paspalum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see a little bit of Bermuda
grass is growing there, coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of this we're seeing is a video
distortion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some Bermuda grass as a weed
invading seashore paspalum turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some footprints going across
the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can anybody guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: What that might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Elephant footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the muddy areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This course is still under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some open land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the elephants came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those is an adult elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a baby elephant coming
along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the thrilling things about my
job, in addition to me being so interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in grass and getting to see different
grasses growing in so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: places, I also get to see cool things like
elephants going across the turf that one
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't otherwise see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go from the areas near the equator
where there's all warm season grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, grasses that use the C4
photosynthetic pathway, up to Korea or
[SPEAKER_00]: northern Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Hokkaido in the northern part
of Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all cool season grasses,
something similar to what would be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rye grasses and the fescue grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see a bit of that in the high
elevation areas in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a golf course in Yamanashi
Prefecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mount Fuji in the background on a
late summer day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only a little bit of snow
around the summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Japan, it gets into the transition
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then much of Asia is what we would
call transition zone, where it can be both
[SPEAKER_00]: warm and cool season grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an interesting thing about Asia is
there's not a lot of turf grass research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this vast area of the world
without turf grass research stations,
[SPEAKER_00]: without people doing a lot of research
about grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I travel around, I'm able to learn
a lot about what is actually growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not able to put out test plots or
try new varieties or new species of grass
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just would not grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not be feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this map, and I marked in Cornell
red the various places that I've traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of these places, so this is Guam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Melbourne, Adelaide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mauritius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go a little bit outside of Asia
because Mauritius is Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dubai in the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then various places through South
Asia, Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And East Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to a lot of places to study
about grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aren't just one-time visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a place like Tokyo is just
marked on there once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been there, obviously,
a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you an idea of the scale
of this, some of you will have been to
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, probably are from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last week, I flew from Reykjavik in
Iceland to New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flight is actually shorter than
the Bangkok to Tokyo flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take the Bangkok to Tokyo flight
many times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's longer than the flight from New
York City to Reykjavik.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would just be from Bangkok here up
to Tokyo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a huge variety in the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, how can we predict
what grass we would use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the question everybody asks me,
the first question is, what grass should I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at so many of the turf
grasses that were planted in the 1990s,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't work very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to explain a little bit
later why I think that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question, what grass should I
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we possibly predict that if we
aren't testing grasses in different areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second main question, which I will
touch on how I try to address that,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how should we manage the grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we choose the grass, how can we
manage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little bit today
about how we might manage some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient additions to the grass,
looking at what the nutrient requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grass are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this little chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just plotted on the y-axis is the
average annual temperature, which ranges
[SPEAKER_00]: here from 15 to about 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 28 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just listed these cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the city's down at the bottom,
that means it has a cooler average annual
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city's listed at the top,
it means it has a higher average annual
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that we would decide
what grass to use in a broad way would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at what the temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice, if you'd go to all of
these places and look at the grasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get above an average annual
temperature of 20 degrees, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really see the cool season grasses growing
in those areas at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can basically say that the 20-degree
average annual temperature is a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good cutting-off point for where the
southern transition zone ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't attempt to grow cool season
grasses anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool season grasses are those that
use the C3 photosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Dallas, it's mostly warm season
grass, but there's a bit of cool season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Fukuoka, there's mostly warm season,
but a bit of cool season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenville, South Carolina, Shanghai,
Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in Atlanta will have tall fescue
lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool season grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, they also have a lot of warm
season grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to look at it is just by the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to look at it more specifically,
it's interesting to look at something
[SPEAKER_00]: called the growth potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple handouts left if
you're interested in this and want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also post this on my website
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can download all these slides,
and you'll also be able to download the
[SPEAKER_00]: handout, which has these equations and
links to additional information on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's asianturfgrass.com, and you can
find on the blog section of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a new update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth potential generates a number
between 0 and 1 that essentially tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: how close the actual temperature is to the
optimum temperature for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some general research that
says for cool season grasses, they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the best, and they have the optimum
photosynthesis when the average
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this equation looks a little bit
tricky, but there's actually only one
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the GP is growth potential,
which is what we're going to calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum temperature is a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just change it based on what we decide
our optimum temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variance just adjusts the shape of the
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only variable we have here is the
actual temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can put that in on a daily basis or
a weekly basis or a monthly basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can calculate what the growth
potential is of the turf, which tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: how we expect the grass to grow in
response to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So assuming that water is not limiting,
assuming that light is not limiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming that the amount of nitrogen that
the plant has in the leaf is not limiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the temperature will be controlling
the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get this type of curve then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got temperature on the x-axis
going from 0 degrees Celsius up to 31.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the warm season curve,
we see it starts slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get to about 12 degrees or 15
degrees, which is where warm season
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses will come out of dormancy and
start growing, then we see a gradual
[SPEAKER_00]: increase until we get up to about 25
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get a growth potential that's
greater than 0.75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning the grass could grow at 75% or
more of its potential with an optimum of
[SPEAKER_00]: 31, which is what the textbooks say is the
optimum growth temperature for warm season
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't let warm season grasses go
down after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to lots of people in Dubai
where sometimes the temperatures are well
[SPEAKER_00]: into the 40s, and they assure me that as
long as the grasses are supplied with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water, they don't see a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big restriction in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I read about the photosynthesis of
warm season grasses, there's been some
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments with Bermuda grass where they
accidentally let the greenhouse get too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, and the temperature was up to 40 or
above, and actually the grass was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with warm season grasses,
basically anywhere in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get an average temperature that's
above about 33 or 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any temperature that we're looking at,
we can expect the warm season grasses are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow better with increasing
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cool season grasses, it's a bit
different because now we get a peak around
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 degrees, and as it gets above 20
degrees, we'll see a restriction in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked up the 30-year average
weather data for Syracuse, and I
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated the monthly growth potential
based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is January through December,
and I've plotted the monthly growth
[SPEAKER_00]: potential based on the average temperature
on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Frank could probably tell me
if this is relatively accurate or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is predicting that the grass starts
to grow just a little bit in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows relatively well by May.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the potential to grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is assuming it's supplied with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing else is limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks by October, it's really
slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In November, it stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it shows for Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think based on my time here,
this seems about right to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we're getting a number from
zero to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could actually look at that as a
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could multiply that times something
such as the number nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could say, and I'll talk about this
at the end of the presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we choose a maximum nitrogen rate that we
want to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the amount of nitrogen in the
leaf tends to be relatively constant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the growth rate of the grass is going
to be using nitrogen at a rate that's
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to the growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can supply that nitrogen,
and we can make sure that the grass is not
[SPEAKER_00]: limited in nitrogen at the times when the
temperatures are at an optimum for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will lead to, theoretically,
an optimal photosynthesis for the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add in a city where it's hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add in Shanghai onto this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see it looks quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now instead of just looking at the
overall temperature, we're looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit more detail by calculating
the growth potential on a monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shanghai now is this color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winters are a little bit warmer in
Shanghai, but it's still cold enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass really won't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a month ahead in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the March growth potential in
Shanghai is pretty similar to the April
[SPEAKER_00]: growth potential in Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the April growth potential in Syracuse
is very similar to the May growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the April growth potential in
Shanghai is very similar to the May growth
[SPEAKER_00]: potential in Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after peaking in May in Shanghai,
it comes down again in June, July,
[SPEAKER_00]: August, and September because it's too hot
in those months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of photo respiration
going on, and the net photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: not nearly as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with cool season grasses in
high temperatures is largely a problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: photo respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photosynthetic system is not
working so efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the autumn, Shanghai,
it can grow well again, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: plummets in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it very interesting to look at
the growth potential, to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed way that different grasses may
grow in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something else going on
besides the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bermuda grass turf mown at 12
millimeters, and it doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this picture is pretty dark,
and there's actually not grass completely
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the surface here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 millimeters is a pretty nice mowing
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a half inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would expect if this grass was growing
in Miami, Florida, or Atlanta,
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia, this photo was taken in
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just here a few weeks ago,
and there's algae growing in between the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this grass was managed in the same way
in Atlanta or in Miami or in Jacksonville,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have a dense turf that completely
covers the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see in Asia is Bermuda grass
has a rather open canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets invaded by weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at Rota Island, which is just
north of Guam, in the northern Marianas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This golf course, this is a golf course
fairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was planted to Bermuda grass,
but now it's completely weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little Bermuda grass left,
and that's what happens when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: apply herbicides to Bermuda grass in that
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass just gets overtaken by weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a couple weeks ago in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Bermuda grass golf course
putting green, and around the outside is
[SPEAKER_00]: Manila grass, Zoysia Mitrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this green was planted about 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoysia has encroached almost two meters in
10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we tend to see in the United
States, they apply herbicides onto Zoysia
[SPEAKER_00]: grass to keep the Bermuda grass from
encroaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited a golf course in Memphis in
April, and they had had to do a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of resodding, and they had to use
herbicides to control the Bermuda grass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's encroaching into the Zoysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Asia, we see something completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Zoysia overtaking Bermuda,
and we see Bermuda not growing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The factors affecting growth are not only,
it's not only the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to consider the temperature,
but there's more to it, and I want to show
[SPEAKER_00]: now something that I think is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a difference between Asia
and North America in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've put a link to this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is climate.asianturfgrass.com,
and I've got some interactive charts here
[SPEAKER_00]: that have normal, climatological normals
weather data embedded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to choose here, let's look at a
couple cities we might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at Hilo, Hawaii, which is on
the big island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at Honolulu, Hawaii,
and let's look at Miami in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to plot time on the x-axis,
and I'm going to plot the average
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature throughout the year on the
y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll click here on trails so that it
will show the mark, and we'll just click
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Miami's a bit cooler in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miami's the kind of greenish one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speed this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the temperatures are
relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes down to about 20, comes up just a
bit over 25 during the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Miami comes down to be a little
bit cooler in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the temperatures are quite similar,
but there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have been to Hilo?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have been to Honolulu?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go and look at the grasses,
you will find, if you walk out of the Hilo
[SPEAKER_00]: airport, there's palm trees with manila
grass growing around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to Honolulu, you will see a
lot of bermudagrass growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those grasses, even though it's very
close geographically, it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: species of grasses tending to grow in a
wild or relatively low-maintenance type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to change the y-axis now to
sunshine hours, and you'll see Hilo
[SPEAKER_00]: separates now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miami and Honolulu, on average,
have about 200 to 300 hours of bright
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bright sunshine hours,
which is measured when the light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: is greater than 120 watts per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Square meter or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure on that unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hilo, however, has, on average,
maybe 150 hours per month of bright
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means it's considerably more
cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means there's less light
available for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we model photosynthesis,
a simple way to model photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: say that it's equal to the light times the
temperature times the amount of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaf times the water availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put an index of 0 to 1 for every
one of those main factors and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the light was 0, for instance,
it would cancel out having an optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of water, optimum amount of
nitrogen, and optimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's completely dark and you have no
energy, you won't have photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, if there's no water,
you won't have photosynthesis despite the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that you could have an optimum
temperature, optimum nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and optimum light availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in managed turf grass systems,
we can usually control the water a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have drainage systems and
because we have irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just drop water out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's something that we
theoretically can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we apply nitrogen fertilizer,
we can very precisely control how much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen's in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means I also drop that out when
I'm looking at how these factors may
[SPEAKER_00]: influence photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're left with is temperature and
sunshine hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's awesome, instead of
plotting time versus sunshine hours or
[SPEAKER_00]: time versus the optimum temperature,
I like to plot sunshine hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we'll get a circle that describes
the area on this chart that's
[SPEAKER_00]: circumscribed in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you how this looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just, we'll simplify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just look at Honolulu and Hilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now on the x-axis, we're looking at the
temperature throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the y-axis, we're looking at sunshine
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it draws a circle around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this combination of temperature and
sunshine hours on this scatter plot is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the growing environment is at
Honolulu.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing environment at Hilo has no
overlap with Honolulu.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a single day in the year when,
on average, the combination of temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and sunshine hours is the same,
because there's no overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a single day in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is interesting to apply
also to places where I've never been,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Rio de Janeiro, because they were
going to choose what grass was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: planted on the golf course in the
Olympics, which in the turf grass field,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was kind of an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked up the data, and I thought
it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Rio, rather than being similar,
I'll show you Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rid of Hilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's draw Miami here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make this fast, I'll just drag it
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the circle that Miami
circumscribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes down to about 19 degrees at the
coldest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up to about 28 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, there's always between 200
to 310 sunshine hours per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the growing environment in Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of turf grass, or certainly golf
people in the United States, they seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that warm season grasses are kind of
like, if it works in Florida, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work someplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would say, just because the
temperatures are the same, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have the light,
the photosynthesis is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we draw Rio on here now, you'll see
there's also zero overlap with Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now Rio's in orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miami is in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's not a single day
in the year in which, on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature combination and the
sunshine combination is the same at Rio
[SPEAKER_00]: and at Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the temperatures are
almost the same, it actually gets colder
[SPEAKER_00]: on average in Miami, and it gets a little
bit hotter on average in Miami than it
[SPEAKER_00]: does in Rio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sunshine hours are considerably
less in Rio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would tell me maybe the grasses
that work in Miami would not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: work at Rio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is the grasses are
similar to the grasses at Hilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see a huge amount of overlap
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Hilo's in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rio's in orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we draw these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They completely overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hong Kong will overlap also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hong Kong, I think, is in blue now.
[SPEAKER_00]: These charts, they're interactive,
and they're hours of fun, just like video
[SPEAKER_00]: games.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games for turf grass scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see Hong Kong completely
encircles both Hilo and Rio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's a good thing that I've
traveled to so many of these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these places I've not been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've traveled to enough of them to
have and study the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty confident that if you have
a certain type of species combination
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in one place, probably an area
with such a similar climate is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see similar grasses performing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I like to look in the wild,
and I like to look on low-maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained turf areas such as cemeteries,
parks, and in the wild, and hiking,
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing mountains, and just see what's
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an excellent example in Thailand
at a place that's called Marakatayawan
[SPEAKER_00]: Palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: For short, we just call it the Love
Palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about two and a half hours drive from
Bangkok, and it's the most spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of tropical architecture you'll ever
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was built by the King Rama V,
I believe, in the early 1900s for his
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnant wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now a museum, and it has these
beautifully landscaped lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That under the tree, right under the drip
line, it's Exxonopus compressus,
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf carpet grass, which is an
extremely shade-tolerant grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In full sun, it's Zoysia matrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mowed turf, and you just don't
find Bermuda grass there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the United States, we think of
Zoysia matrella, manila grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: as being a grass that's really suitable
for shaded environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Bangkok, because of the cloud cover
that restricts the light, the full sun
[SPEAKER_00]: area is equivalent in the amount of
photosynthetically active radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps to a shaded area, to what we
consider a shaded area in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is extremely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made lots of measurements about this
and written about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the handout, I put links to
articles I wrote on this that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: downloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go to other sections of this
webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here, where I actually
estimate the daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is better for viewing on the
computer instead of in the presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see this if you go to the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read more about what I do with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to say quickly let me
check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a little bit about this in the
handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have heard of daily light
integral, DLI?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's used a lot in greenhouses,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So daily light integral is you take every
second, you measure the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux density, the PPFD,
or the PAR, the photosynthetically active
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure it every second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over a 24-hour period, add all of that
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a daily light integral,
which is the number of photons per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter per day expressed in units of moles
per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that is difficult to
measure all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can estimate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty accurately from the sunshine hours
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called the Angstrom
equation that allows us to relate the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine hours data to the actual
intensity of the light that reaches the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth's surface in terms of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on that, there's another,
it's a pretty simple conversion factor to
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate the photosynthetic, what
percentage of the total energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches the surface is photosynthetically
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can actually estimate,
we can take those sunshine hours data and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just look at the sunshine hours data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to, we can estimate the DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which unfortunately in turf grass,
we don't really have good numbers for what
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual requirements are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have some ideas based on what the
estimated DLIs are in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on what grass species we
actually see growing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's empirical research, not really
controlled research in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a trip to Hilo to check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was leaving Honolulu, the top left
photo is the view from the airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at 428 in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly 30 minutes later, I'd gone from
sunshine to where I was arriving in Hilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was now very low clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those type of clouds would be blocking
about 75% of the photosynthetically active
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day going back, as we were going
down the runway in Hilo, taxiing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was raining hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were low lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were low clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also gonna be blocking a lot of the
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arriving back to Honolulu, it's almost
completely clear skies, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, you can see the average
annual sunshine hours in Honolulu are
[SPEAKER_00]: considerably more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, for cool season grasses,
this isn't so important because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use all of the available energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't use all of the available light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But warm season grasses are not limited by
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're limited by how much light is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we keep increasing the light,
the grass would grow more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we start restricting the light by
clouds, that's really meaningful for warm
[SPEAKER_00]: season grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so meaningful for cool season
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because most of the turf grass
research is done in the United States and
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of the United States where
the turf grass research is done seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cool season areas, I think this is
something that hasn't really been explored
[SPEAKER_00]: in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people tend to think that clouds don't
have a huge impact on how the grass will
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a huge difference because the
weather is actually different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those charts show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we actually go there, we see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're in Honolulu, this is all
Bermuda grass and it's just thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Hilo, we really struggle to find
Bermuda grass where we actually would...
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Zoysia, Zoysia matrella manila
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also find a lot of carpet grass
here, the same grasses that are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, the same grasses that grow in
South China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find Bermuda grass right at the base
of the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think, well, wait, you're saying
Bermuda grass has a high light
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we find it under trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those areas don't get mowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hypothesis is or my theory is that
it's the mowing and cutting off the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that disrupts the ability of the Bermuda
grass to photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're removing the photosynthetic
machinery in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we don't mow the Bermuda grass,
it can persist as a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we mow it, it gets out competed by
the grasses that can tolerate the mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a type of tropical environment or a
subtropical environment where there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grasses that are growing in full sun
are the grasses that in the Southeastern
[SPEAKER_00]: United States would be considered the
shade tolerant grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about
management now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a different way of
going about thinking of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of builds on what I was
doing at Cornell for my graduate research
[SPEAKER_00]: and is also related to having to advise
people in so many different places and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to put that growth potential model
together with some good soil test data,
[SPEAKER_00]: some better soil test data research and
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's five key points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taken all together, we come up with a
very simple equation to predict how much
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank paid for a lot of tissue testing
when I was doing my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shocked looking back on it on how much
our laboratory fees were.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do all the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the valuable things that came
out of it is we realized how the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in the leaves change or don't
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the short term, we get a lot of
fluctuation in leaf nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big picture is basically the
nutrient levels of turf grass leaves tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be relatively constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we usually will have about 4%
nitrogen and about half a percent
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and about 2% potassium in the
leaves, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know basically here's what's in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to harvest the leaves
and take them away, we should remember we
[SPEAKER_00]: know sort of what's in them, even without
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a chart that shows some of the
elements on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the y-axis, the percentage in the dry
matter of the different elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium, for example, would be about
0.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on my research of hundreds of
samples, based on lots of other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: research, we get this type of general kind
of normal levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, the second important thing to
remember is that the amount of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that we supply to the grass controls the
growth and the uptake of other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is validated by some recent
research in Wisconsin by Dr. Cousseau and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the link to download this paper,
which is a wonderful paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad they published this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link to this is in the handout also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they found nitrogen supply was the
primary determinant of turf grass growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, plant nutrient demand, and nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen uptake accounted for over 88%
of the uptake of all other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the uptake of phosphorus and potassium
were strongly related to tissue nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what the soil test levels were,
which is also very similar to my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what we did with
modifying the potassium levels in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of potassium in the leaves was
always at or above what we consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nitrogen that the grass takes up is
really controlling this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth rate, the growth rate is
really controlling this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the grass is growing more and as we
have 4% nitrogen in the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass is growing more and more,
taking up more nitrogen, it's also taking
[SPEAKER_00]: up more potassium or more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what this does is allows us
to sort of forget about some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can just assume, to make things
simple, we can just make, we can assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything's present in proportion to
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we know how much nitrogen we
apply, because we can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature-based growth potential to
predict how much nitrogen the grass will
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed earlier how we can calculate a
monthly growth potential that's from zero
[SPEAKER_00]: to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the growth potential is zero,
for example in December, how much nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think the grass will use in
December?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say our maximum monthly nitrogen
for cool season grass here, if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sports, this is very site-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the grass species,
the desired turf performance, the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was a sports field, we might say
four grams or five grams of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per month would be the
maximum we'd ever apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just set the maximum of four,
for example, let's say that's a perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: ryegrass sports field, and multiply it
times zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us how much, you know,
for December, that tells us how much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen we need to apply in December,
or how much nitrogen the grass would be
[SPEAKER_00]: using in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's go to June, when the growth
potential is very high, the grass is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't apply four grams of nitrogen
per square meter in that month,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the grass, the nitrogen percentage in
the leaf will go down, and the grass won't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as well, and it won't be able to
respond from where.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that is a simple way
to estimate how much nitrogen the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: may be using at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, the elemental content in the
leaves is relatively constant,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we always have a similar proportion of
potassium, phosphorus, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium back to the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just look at the nitrogen,
we can estimate how much of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: elements the grass is harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MLSN guidelines, that stands for
Minimum Levels for Sustainable Nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are new soil test guidelines
that were developed in a joint project
[SPEAKER_00]: between the Asian Turf Grass Center and
Pace Turf out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, is a new set of soil
guidelines based on the MALIC-3 soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: extractant, where we looked at over 16,000
soil test results from good performing
[SPEAKER_00]: turf grass sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because they were all from good
performing turf grass sites, we could say
[SPEAKER_00]: that whatever was in the soil was enough
to produce good turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we modeled the distribution,
and we found what type of distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: best fit the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was a log logistic
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we get the curve and the
probability density function and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cumulative density function, and we can
say now we're at 0.1, so we're at 10% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the samples would be below that,
90% of the samples would be above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is set at the 0.1 level,
we said that's for these actual real data
[SPEAKER_00]: from real turf grass sites where the turf
really was performing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at those data, and we didn't
pick the median.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't say we want to be in the top
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at what's the minimum levels
for nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of these were from good performing
sites, so we're very confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give ourselves a 10% safety margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say 10% of the samples were below
this, so let's say let's pick this level
[SPEAKER_00]: as our minimum level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the guidelines, and this is
something that we look at as an ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continuously update these
as we add more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are significantly lower than the
conventional guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, for potassium,
it's 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, Penn State wants like 190.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's watching this at Penn State,
I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sand root zone, it's impossible to
have 190 parts per million potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's just impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conventional guideline is like 50,
75, sometimes up to 110 for potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at some of the latest
research, it suggests that 50 or 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a paper from Connecticut or
Massachusetts where they did the,
[SPEAKER_00]: from UMass, where they did the long term,
which was five years, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and potassium application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they were below the
conventional guidelines, they didn't see a
[SPEAKER_00]: response to apply potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that suggests it's less than 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's research from Florida for
Bermudagrass that suggests it's about 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research that I did suggested it's
below 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cool thing is, these numbers
that we generate from the MLSN guidelines,
[SPEAKER_00]: we compare it to, we compare it to other
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit conservative,
meaning it's safe, but it's like half or
[SPEAKER_00]: less than the conventional guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real close to what seems to be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at phosphorus for Maloc 3,
there's some research from Wisconsin and
[SPEAKER_00]: from Penn State that says maybe the real
number where we'll get deficiency is seven
[SPEAKER_00]: or nine or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're saying with the MLSN
guidelines is, as long as we maintain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil at the guideline or above,
we don't have to worry about adding that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass will have access to enough of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only have to add that element as we
get below, as we approach that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're making this also a citizen
science project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just introduced the Global Soil Survey
for Sustainable Turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping that hundreds or
thousands of people from around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: will contribute samples from their site in
order to help validate this for a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: range of areas and for a wide range of
turf grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those levels work warm and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as we know, they work warm and
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody has any better information,
we're very public about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please contact us and let us know that
these numbers are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we eventually will actually share the
data and we'll share the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with our software and
writing some scripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope people at Cornell are also
using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're writing scripts to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will share that code also so people
can see exactly what we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to be very open about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at it as just an ongoing
project where you continually make these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that because of the way we're
doing this, eventually this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard soil test recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we consider those previous points
mathematically, the minimum nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement can be determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to explain it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some more examples of that
in the handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I link to other articles I've written
where I explain it explicitly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, all we need to do is we
estimate the harvest or we measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest so we know how much of an element
we've harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add that to the MLSN guideline,
which makes sure that we're keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: amount in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we subtract the amount that's on
the soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's a positive number, that's how
much of that element we need to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's a negative number, that means
there's that much excess of that element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil, even accounting for it,
we're assuming we're harvesting all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clippings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can estimate the clipping yield
based on whatever percent nitrogen there
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all explained in the handout if
you're into turf and want to see how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that we just recently
did in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think that this will be the way
that people choose to fertilize if they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure that they're applying
the minimum amount of fertilizer necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: to still create high quality turf grass
conditions, but not apply any excess
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more information at my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will post these slides and the handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the handout has links to all of the
