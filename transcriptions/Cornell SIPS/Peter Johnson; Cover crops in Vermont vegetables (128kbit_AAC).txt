[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Pete Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a farm called Pete's Greens in
northern Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zone three, zone four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started as a tiny little two-acre,
no, half-acre farm 20 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience with cover cropping up to
about four years ago was sort of typical
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, throw in some rye, throw in some
buckwheat here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I decided to go and find enough
land to have three or four times as much
[SPEAKER_00]: land as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crop on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crop about 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have about 400 acres in rotation
now of varying quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just jumped into this big experiment
of trying to learn about technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just learning about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my talk will just basically show the
experiments that I've been involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: for three or four years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different pieces of equipment on different
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I realize I know almost
nothing about and have a ton more to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now way more fun for me than growing
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing of the vegetables is sort of
just a proof that you did a decent job
[SPEAKER_00]: with the prep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also trying, we use a lot of raw
chicken manure and other bulk soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to get our soils fully up
to speed, ready to roll in the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping period before vegetables sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still a couple years away from
really being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm seeing lots of good promise for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken a lot of land that was sort of
real old, played out land, brought it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two or three years of lots of
fertility, lots of cover cropping has
[SPEAKER_00]: really been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this slide showing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get back to the beginning again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go at a certain pace,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off thinking I'm going to do
like two-year sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legumes, grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a bunch of that for the first
couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of red clover, all-site clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best grasses for us seem to be
fescues, real aggressive growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not finding that after this,
my soil has really transformed the ways I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like it gained enough bulk
organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, we've been hanging this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, we've been mowing it back
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all cases, I haven't been super
impressed by the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm basically doing that with land
that's really got some issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be locked away for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mix that we had this summer,
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some peas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole grab bag oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perhaps the most important slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 300 pounds an acre of oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Vern talked about tried and true stuff
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hot weather, sudex, things like that,
hardly grew for me this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so cold and wet where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oats, day in, day out, I can get to crank
300 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how we the field is,
I basically get a clean stand every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the most important factor
for me in what I choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to ask questions at any point,
because this is just a grab bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do more and more of
cheap seed, high, high rates, a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of organic matter production in a
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rye vetch that was knocked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it looked like before we
knocked it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some no-till stuff this spring
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has struggles doing it without having
some weeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And made me kind of think it's not really
going to be our future necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just a little bit of established
weed from the previous crop really becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: something serious in the next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We played around with caliente mustard
this year, just aiming at weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: killing weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the rig later that we used
to incorporate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult without doing a really
careful trial to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my farm down there in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craftsbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half an hour south of the Canadian
border in the middle of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mix of, I was telling John
Paul earlier, I tried sun hemp this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got about eight inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be this huge mass of
legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cool, wet conditions, it just
didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me pointing to a sun hemp plant
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting how something
that could be awesome one year,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in a climate like mine,
is not so great some other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show how, even in this great high seed
rate mix like this, there is pigweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pigweed plant right in the
middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a rotation like I'm working on,
I really can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show some tools later that we're
using to try to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me like with mixes,
I have a lot to learn about the species
[SPEAKER_00]: composition, the rate, the timing,
what time of year it is, to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a place that was no-till,
knocked down, rye vetch, seeded into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to show that there's some
weeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually use buckwheat a lot in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll seed a sod crop, grass and legume,
right through the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll use buckwheat in the midsummer
period as a weed suppressant for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more effective than oats at that
time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat's at about 40 pounds an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: An acre will basically keep weeds from
going to seed in a newly seeded sod crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: More pigweed in this mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had sudax and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was carefully prepared land that
was tine-weeded before seeding the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflower is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year I'd grown them this year,
we had lots and lots of tourists checking
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the biomass I'm seeing off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is cheap if you buy bird seed
rather than sunflower seed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And germination seemed to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a super weedy vegetable land that
had been abused for two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got those weeds down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, OK, what are they going to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to make seeds or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the critical question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really depends on how quickly
things fill in and cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, probably yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's gallons of it in there and
it'll usually make seed wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the 300 pounds acre of oats,
very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe none.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fun thing we got this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to do a mulching project
for a number of years where we make round
[SPEAKER_00]: bales and then blow them onto vegetable
plants yay tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've now played around with four
different round bales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round bale choppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them cut the round bales quite
short enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my neighbor had this forage chopper
that we bought for $3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was rye vetch, yay tall,
that we'd kind of forgotten about and had
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow vegetables on this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's nothing you can do
with it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how many times you harrow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mowed it with a hay mower and then
chopped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blew it over the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we hit the stage just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fully ingrained but still quite
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fertility production from this for
the vegetable crop is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it was from the vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there wasn't that much vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the rye really released a lot of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a fast step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that land was just ready to go and
grew great crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started into equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was chopping windrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we've discovered now is that when
we're doing our mulching, we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: forage chop and then spread that with a
manure spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take dry round bales or we take dry
windrows, forage chop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a silage operation at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't quite figured out the
details of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that spreads really well with a manure
spreader right over very small vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's only an inch long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it falls off at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we were, all the round bale
choppers are all two and a half inches
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it bridges over the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, this is a new, we call it a speed
disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmet's a Czech company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really slick tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of rocks in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly breaking gang bolts on
disc harrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tool that's designed to be used
at nine miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing it incorporating two year
old grass legume sod that historically we
[SPEAKER_00]: would moldboard plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three passes with this thing at nine miles
an hour at different angles in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions if the soil is moist at the
right level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can seed a cover crop into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to four passes over the course of
three weeks and you can seed vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has become sort of a super
critical tool for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a different version called a
Lemkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts are much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speed is tremendous when you have a
lot of acres to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each disc is individually,
has an individual spring on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just roll over rocks with no
problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really long term, more established sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes more passes than three to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still with the speed, it's not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and got a range rail with six inch
spacing this year because we had one that
[SPEAKER_00]: was seven and a half and it wasn't doing,
wasn't planting stuff close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a nice addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I think we're going to go to
broadcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you take me back to bidding and I
could shuttle through again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Farmet machine just got a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, back to the equipment part.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was smarter, I could do that,
couldn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seeder is not very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a seeder on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drops the seed right here, right behind
the disc, right before the rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's way too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking at either pulling an air
seeding cart behind this or having a much
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger air seeding tank on the front three
point hitch of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow to be able to carry at least a ton
of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the idea of this because I'm
not going to have rows at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a uniform distribution
of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were demoing this and playing around
with it just to see if we liked how it
[SPEAKER_00]: covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like the main concern is it
likes to cover the seed a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: deeply sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could adjust the depth of these
discs with these rollers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can now be seeding at six,
seven, eight, nine miles an hour rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than five with a grain drill, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're covering several hundred acres
and doing sometimes multiple crops in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same acres every year, speed becomes
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things come with a variety of
rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really heavy one that packs the
soil more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our little cobble-together set up
for incorporating the mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we flail mowed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just seconds behind, we
disc-caroed and culti-packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to work fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 30-foot Lely tine weeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tine weed a lot in our vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost don't plant anything without a
week and a half to two weeks of every
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four days tine weeding as a stale
seed bed practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, boy, I'll do this on large
scale for cover crops and it'll work
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't work that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't, I'm not really quite sure
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spring, I tine weeded a field for
three weeks prior to seeding cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just too cold and wet and
nothing was growing at all at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I seeded my cover crop,
I still had a whole lot of weeds come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably just a timing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd almost rather just use a much
higher rate with some cheaper crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to get out and about with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a tool that has a lot of
potential for cleaning up some ground
[SPEAKER_00]: before seeding a cover crop to try to keep
weeds from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't really found a sweet spot
with it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this no-till grain drill we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a minimal till.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the caddy that went in front of a
regular grain drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these coulters made slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's interested, I'm also learning
how to do my own tiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tile plot to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole another saga.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grain drill that went behind
that coulter cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was kind of a big cumbersome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to turn around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Needed quite a bit of horsepower to pull
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't let me move.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what I found, and I haven't done it
enough to really be sure, but it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like those large seeded things,
if you let them go to seed and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: sit on top of the soil for the winter,
I have not had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I incorporate them, I sometimes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of cool to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can dump all this stuff on top of
the soil and let everything eat it all
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have friends who had a lot of
problems with buckwheat doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't been an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice because I like to have buckwheat
as a component of some of those mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's going to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an unverfirth rolling harrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really cool tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have these little scraper
leveling blades or leveling levelers that
[SPEAKER_00]: sit in front of those baskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then little tines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're off it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two sets of rolling baskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's 30 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were worried about making really
smooth hay fields for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was our plan early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to be haying and making all
this mulch and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really important tool for
making one pass of this makes fairly rough
[SPEAKER_00]: land pretty darn smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also great if you're broadcasting
cover crops to incorporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also stale seed bed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well rather than the tine
weeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pass with it just makes things
smoother and nicer and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is $5,000 out of Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: In good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really awesome tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover a lot of acres in a short amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another speed disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Lemkin Rubin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one we got first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went away from it because the parts are
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to go through discs and
bearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seemed kind of crazy how much
they cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a power harrow a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have broken a lot of sod with
this too in places that are too steep to
plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't do great in rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great for finished touch over
vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another piece of the component.
[SPEAKER_00]: In France they seed a lot of grain behind
power harrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to be the standard practice over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grain drill mounted behind the
power harrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two pins on a roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go really fast and really
shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go eight miles an hour and just be
skimming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very versatile tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a better tool if you don't have a lot
of rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to use it in certain fields,
not in other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of rocks, rock rake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took on 70 acres a couple springs ago
that was at corn ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has a rock resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of cobbles like this is just
infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to seed really nice
alfalfa grass down by making one pass with
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had another machine to pick up
the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also leaves a perfectly smooth
finish for seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versatile tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The round bale mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I kind of think of mulching as
kind of an extension of cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about all the different things
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulching is sort of like moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving cover crop from one place to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real simple old time bale
chopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a flail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flail's just kind of beat around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't actually cut the grass at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it throws it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good for garlic and
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things where you're just kind of doing
bulk mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best one we found for actually
cutting quite short.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has two different chopping systems in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of horsepower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe a bale every five minutes,
four to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have any rocks or
anything like that in your bale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we were trying to use to blow
onto the vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does chop it fine enough that it
works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a pretty slow step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if we're going to be
incorporating it into a lot of our acreage
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just learning about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an air seeding cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to pull this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 20 foot wide one of those
farments coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea being we could pull this
behind that and be seeding into the
[SPEAKER_00]: farment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a big cumbersome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could go out with four tons of seed
and something like this and not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and refill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be for bulk, like 300 pounds an
acre oats, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody has any experience with this
or an air seeder like this, I found this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a big tank where the seed goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those are just shanks where the
seed comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're five inches apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really close spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 24 foot wide machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to get away from the 12 foot
wide grain drill, which is just taking too
[SPEAKER_00]: long for the land we're covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just arrived today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're going to pull the 20
foot new speed disc with because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend more time with my daughter and less
time on the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a horsepower like this is super
cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're moving towards speed,
quick passes, shallow passes, fast passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate it, get something else on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of like our version of no till is
lots of quick, shallow passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: not bringing up lots of weed seeds from
below, lots of different cover crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: different sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell, very much a learning
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions, comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they want you telling us this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's top secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: 360.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest tractor I have is 140
horsepower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also 13 feet wide, which is going to
be interesting on the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we pull implements down the road that
are 15 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something about the height
that scares people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right out front.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor is restoring a Porsche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him this is going to come into
his shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to paint this first.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this sort of sums up how we do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of go online, learn about it,
figure out how to buy a version of it that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can afford, bring it home, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't know it until you get it
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always learn something
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just informs the next step of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you said you're going for cheap,
what's your target price right there for
your other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course, that varies a lot from if
you're seeding down a nice alfalfa grass
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, it's going to be $45.50 to $70 for
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going organic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm not, depending on whether I
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 300 pounds of oats I can get done
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: For $55 to $60, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun hemp was an expensive failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a question I have to ask
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is three crops in a season, if I have a
piece of ground where I'm really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: break up a weed seed cycle, and I might
want to actually have three cover crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of a season to have a little
tillage in between, am I going to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: $100 bucks per seeding there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really know that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have vegetable crops that gross $45,000
an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to seem like a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sense is the more you spend,
it's totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it's a new part of our budget
we're kind of getting used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like our seed costs just keep
going up and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the benefits are really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pete, what's your typical rotation
you're in the vegetable in the field for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the grand plan was two years veggies
and two years in a sod crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm finding that in my second year in
veggies, I'm not getting the performance I
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking now mostly at one year of
veggies and land that's in really good
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, probably one year of veggies,
one year cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the one year in cover crop is
more like a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how all this stuff kind of goes
around in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually have enough land here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could basically be one year in veggies,
two years off, three years off in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some land that still is
recovering from being over cropped for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be off for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm finding that in that second year,
no matter how good a job we did the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year in weed control, I start having some
weeds go into seed in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't spend hardly any time hand
weeding on my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small part of our budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's either controlled with tractor
cultivation and pre-treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's not really controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like land that's just first year in
veggies after not being in it for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It solves a ton of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes all this stuff seem cheap in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was created, though, by deciding
to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it can't happen everywhere,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think... Well, you know,
sneak them in wherever you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would advise trying to... I see
great benefits, too, from a rotation that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes a mile or two or three miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, potato beetles for us are a real
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can move our 10 acres of
potatoes a couple, three miles away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We travel 20 miles right now to one farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten comfortable with the travel
and the trade-off of that, compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: having everything close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we won't be cropping down there for
a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it goes 23 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't irrigate is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to move around, we haven't
irrigated outdoors in seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly it's a lot of organic matter
residue in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not so tied into an
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go and get a new field and farm
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of like creating these
landscapes around that are in prime
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'd sort of dash in and grow a
crop and get out of there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is leading to a fairly low-input,
fairly low-cost production system that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be working for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still another three years before
everything is fully online to make it all
[SPEAKER_00]: work the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sir, can you still hang off those acres?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it turns out the fertility
suck-up of hay is enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just to replace the nutrients it's
taking is about two-thirds of the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's nothing to screw up
trying to grow vegetables than having a
[SPEAKER_00]: major haying week going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the same guys, the same
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're haying, you're haying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're not doing anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually love haying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're mostly flail mowing stuff
back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pig farm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make a whole bunch of round bales
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they come back onto the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you were doing a small
school square bale, premium organic hay
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you could make money doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd have to be set up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too wet where we are, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had to buy, we have a mower
with metal-on-metal rollers in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: crimp the legumes well enough to get
legumes dry at all for our mulching hay
[SPEAKER_00]: and for our pig hay, because we're trying
not to wrap bales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a critical piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get red clover to dry,
period, otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's helped a ton with that.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
