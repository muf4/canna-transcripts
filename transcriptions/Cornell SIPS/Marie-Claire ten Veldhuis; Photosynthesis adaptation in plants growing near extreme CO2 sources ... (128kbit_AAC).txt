[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jason, for the intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, I'm the advisor of Judith,
who, if you've seen her talk, works on
[SPEAKER_02]: meteorology, so to say, the environment
that the plants are exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also my background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trained as a hydrologist,
work a lot across disciplines with
[SPEAKER_02]: meteorology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I always say, we have a special
fondness for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is sort of how I ended up working
on photosynthesis in a very cool
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, or a very hot environment,
I should say, Yellowstone National Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just tell you briefly how,
as a hydrologist, I ended up studying
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this all came through lichens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lichens is a very interesting species,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a symbiosis between a fungus and
an alga or cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is really cool about lichens is
that they can dry out completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as you hydrate them,
they restart photosynthesis almost
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was actually doing a sabbatical a
couple of years ago with a hydrology
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a group that invited me
and said, hey, would you like to come and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a look at our work on lichens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have this very cool behavior
in relation to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up studying the water transport
in lichens with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing we did is that we
started looking at oxygen evolution from
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis, sort of playing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we found out is when we
expose the lichen to light, then dark,
[SPEAKER_02]: then light, then dark, we saw this oxygen
evolution accelerate with subsequent light
[SPEAKER_02]: exposures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought what could be happening
there is that, of course, the alga
[SPEAKER_02]: produces oxygen, which is beneficial for
the fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the fungus respires, produces CO2
that is then beneficial for photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_02]: by the alga.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to prove that that
actually was part of the symbiosis in
[SPEAKER_02]: addition to the known symbiosis of water
exchange and sugar exchange between the
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus and the alga.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is not so surprising either,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is a confocal microscopy
image.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I took while at Rutgers University
that was hosting me for this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see they're right in each
other's face, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense that they're exposed to
each other's gas emissions, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this led us to become curious about the
role of CO2 in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the group I was visiting,
Charles Dismukse's lab at Rutgers
[SPEAKER_02]: University, they had mostly focused on the
light reactions around photosystem 2,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're familiar with photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where water is oxidized,
or is split into oxygen and hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: protons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we said, so now that we saw this
effect of CO2 on photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is sort of known, right, that with
higher CO2, there is a fertilization
[SPEAKER_02]: effect where the gross primary production
is increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know from greenhouses that I'm
sure you're much more familiar with than
[SPEAKER_02]: me, is that when they enrich in CO2 up to
about 1,000 ppm, this really benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It improves the fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, this is explained by the
fact that higher CO2 levels enhance the
[SPEAKER_02]: saturation level of the rubisco enzyme
that plays an important role in
[SPEAKER_02]: carboxylation, so the CO2 uptake,
and then conversion to sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also a couple of other
interactions that are not so well
[SPEAKER_02]: understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not straightforward, as in more
CO2, more primary production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just a bit of background of why
CO2 is so important for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here is rubisco, this enzyme that
fixes CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through the Kelvin cycle,
so a series of reactions, it fixes CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: converts it to a couple of intermediate
compounds, eventually goes out as sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is this ribulose,
this phosphate, that needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerated in order to take up the next
CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, what rubisco, this enzyme,
also does, it can react with oxygen,
[SPEAKER_02]: the oxygenation reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is actually not beneficial for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It produces CO2 rather than fixing CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: It produces compounds that the plant needs
to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you want is more carboxylation and
less oxygenation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine that by increasing the
CO2 level, it is just more likely to pick
[SPEAKER_02]: up a CO2 rather than oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a bit of the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that I'll be
coming back to is that in this series of
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions, the Kelvin cycle needs ATP and
NADPH to run the Kelvin cycle in these
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are produced by what's called
the light reactions in the thylakoid
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they capture the light energy that can
be used to produce these ATP and NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be important, as we'll see
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a benefit of having higher CO2
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, very high CO2 can
also lead to acidification of the cell
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because CO2, it's a tiny molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can easily permeate through
membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hydrolyzes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it forms acids, the Lewis acids
that are just the hydrolyzed CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Bronsted acids, so they
actually release protons into the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what that does is that it reduces
pH gradients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these pH gradients across the membrane
are needed to produce ATP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine that when the cell
environment becomes very acidic,
[SPEAKER_02]: it becomes harder and harder to build up a
gradient across the membrane, because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's already so much acid in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes it much harder to produce
ATP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, a very high CO2 level can
actually become harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus it can carbamylate the proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can cause further damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were wondering, so if we have
elevated CO2, how does photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_02]: adapt?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make sure to take the maximum
benefit from higher CO2 versus avoid this
[SPEAKER_02]: acidification effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to look at extreme CO2
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the research has been done on sort
of mild CO2 enrichments up to the 1,000
[SPEAKER_02]: ppm level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to see, what if we go
beyond?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there somewhere a threshold where it
flips from being beneficial to being very
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how we started looking for an
environment where we could find this out
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can imagine that doing this,
I mean, in the growth chamber,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that very representative for the real
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it in the fields, this is being
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called the phase experiments,
FACE.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they find out it's hard to,
I mean, you blow extra CO2 into the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: The field, but to get that well
distributed and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to look for a place where
this is just happening naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, sort of a natural
laboratory where this happens naturally is
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellowstone National Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably familiar with it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a volcanic area with a lot of
geothermal sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's geysers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hot pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And several of those are emitting very
high levels of gaseous CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have been doing so for many centuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the geological research history,
that is likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on records from the USGS,
we know that at least for the last,
[SPEAKER_02]: say since the 1980s or so, they have
records where they have recorded these CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a pretty good idea of also the
history of CO2 emissions around these
[SPEAKER_02]: geothermal sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went to scope out sites across the
Yellowstone National Park that had been
[SPEAKER_02]: reported by USGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: USGS is having very high CO2 emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking up to about 6,000 ppm,
or even beyond in some places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, we wanted to study
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also need places where we find
plants, where we find life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lichens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also look for lichens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't find those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too harsh an environment for the
lichens, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like an acid environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did find vegetation around some of
these sources, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was successful in that sense,
that we could really find a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: geothermal sites, or CO2 emission sites,
I should say, with vegetation close by.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we found these two sites to be
the most stable in CO2 emission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme CO2 emission with 6,000 ppm
elevation, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also vegetation growing very
close to the sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could be pretty sure that they are
really exposed to that very high CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both calcium deposits,
calcium carbonate deposits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what causes these very high
CO2 levels as the gases move through the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine that that takes up all the
CO2 and then emits it into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the other thing we needed is sample
species that would grow very close to
[SPEAKER_02]: those sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also in a controlled environment,
as in ambient CO2, 400 ppm, more or less,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we could compare between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, this is panic grass that
you see on the photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll point it here for the Zoom
attendance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So panic grass is famous for growing close
to these sources in Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has adapted to that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it only grows there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, that was the first species we
thought of targeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turned out not to be useful because
we had no control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had no comparison to an ambient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then Prunella vulgaris, which is
actually a very common plant, it grows in
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of environments, including close to
the CO2 sources, as well as in a more
[SPEAKER_02]: ambient environment, so 400 ppm CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a species we could really
compare between the high and the ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another attribute of Prunella that was
very useful for our work is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't like to close its stomata.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense that even when we harvested
samples from the field, took them to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab for experiments, their stomata would
still be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important if you want to study
gas exchange, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So had they closed their stomata,
there would be another no-go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so Prunella was very helpful in that
regard, that we could really study
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis effects, even when we had
taken them from the field into the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to study the effects of CO2
levels on photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is basically what we wanted to
study, close to this rubisco enzyme that
[SPEAKER_02]: fixes CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to measure this directly, it's kind of
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can measure gas exchange,
but then there's a lot of, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, it's an indirect measurement
because you measure a net CO2 uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where the CO2 goes, and how fast it
reaches rubisco, you don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, it takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to look at dark to light
induction of photosynthesis, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamic that we needed to have more high
resolution time resolution measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead, we used a method that's called
chlorophyll variable fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is fluorescence that's emitted
from photosystem 2, so from the light
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions that produce ATP and ADPH for
the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, sort of in a
simplified scheme of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way this works is that photosystem
2 absorbs the light energy, and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then charge separation happens,
and the electron can be transferred to its
[SPEAKER_02]: primary electron acceptor, QA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from QA, once it's reduced,
it can then again transfer the electron to
[SPEAKER_02]: PQ, a plastoconone that then is converted
into plastoquinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there on, in a series of
reactions, eventually NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: NADP plus is reduced to NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by pumping protons across the
thylakoid membrane at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: we produce a proton gradient that is used
to produce ATP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, once this has happened,
so photosystem 2 has gotten excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has transferred its electron.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one acceptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, we say PS2 is closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cannot take another electron because
it's closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the carrier already has one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if the pigment gets excited,
the energy cannot be transferred through
[SPEAKER_02]: the electron.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets emitted as fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that as long as
photochemistry can be done, the electron
[SPEAKER_02]: can be transferred.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as the system is closed,
we get fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have sort of a probe of the
photosynthesis activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: By measuring fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a little bit of energy
that can be released as heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll go into that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a measurement technique that
really we can tease out the variable
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not so sensitive to the
portion that goes into heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is an issue when interpreting
this kind of observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to monitor fluorescence
emission from photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a probe for what is happening in this
chain of reactions that eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: produces the compounds that run the Kelvin
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thereby, we can say something about
whether or not CO2 is being reduced,
[SPEAKER_02]: taken up from tumors.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then another thing I need to say,
in case people are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorescence method.
[SPEAKER_02]: The method is called PAM fluorometry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been used a lot in photosynthesis
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This technique is slightly different in
that it uses, it's called fast repetition
[SPEAKER_02]: rate fluorometry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses ultra short, high intensity light
pulses to excite the chlorophyll pigment,
[SPEAKER_02]: photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then measure, as you can see on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it measures the chlorophyll
fluorescence that rises as you shoot light
[SPEAKER_02]: on the pigment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the photochemistry goes down,
because the system gets closed,
[SPEAKER_02]: this QA gets reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the rise in fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we flash at a flash rate of 100
hertz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this ultra short pulse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measure variable fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wait about 10 milliseconds then at 100
hertz flash rate frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we get a little bit of reopening of
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the QA gets reoxidized in that
time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fluorescence goes down again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flash again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluorescence goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the variable portion is much smaller
now because the system is still partially
[SPEAKER_02]: closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we continue to flash and we monitor our
variable fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is typically what this looks like
for 50 flashes in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the variable portion of
fluorescence normalized by the maximum of
[SPEAKER_02]: the fluorescence at that particular flash
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the maximum Fm right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we see happening is that as we
continue to flash, it becomes harder and
[SPEAKER_02]: harder to reoxidize between flashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, the variable portion goes
almost down to zero, meaning the system is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't reopen it between flashes
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So QA got reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PQ pool, if you remember, got
completely reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: The system is stuck at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't do further photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we continue to flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I should explain is we
see the oscillations here at the start of
[SPEAKER_02]: the flash train.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a dark-adapted sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what these oscillations represent is
the oxygen evolution from the water
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidation complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens in four steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why you see these
oscillations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's another interesting feature of
this technique that you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: measure the oxygen evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we do not one flash
train, but we continue to flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: In total, we flash 180 trains of 50
flashes each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first train looks like what I just
showed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with an open system,
dark-adapted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start to flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We close the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we wait a half second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the system partially reopens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flash again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wait a half second, flash again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see a series of trains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the system reopening, closing,
reopening, closing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're probing the reduction of the
system by flashing, by these light
[SPEAKER_02]: flashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we hope to see eventually is
that the system will reopen once the
[SPEAKER_02]: electrons are used to produce NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: NADPH is going to be used in the Kelvin
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets reoxidized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means it can receive more
electrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually, you should see this shift
of the electrons being moved into the
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can, again, reoxidize between
trains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expect the system to rise again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's see if that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the result, variable
fluorescence over 180 trains, 9,000
[SPEAKER_02]: flashes in total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the start of the very first flash is
this dark-adapted variable fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the value, also called the maximum
quantum yield of PS2.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people who have used
ferrometry are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we see the system closing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes all the way down, like we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's just squeezed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, indeed, we do see the system
reopening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the overall levels rising a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the system starts to open, but then
closes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, after about a minute,
we see an overall rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: An overall rise of the fluorescence
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is then the signal for us to
observe the reopening of the system by the
[SPEAKER_02]: downstream reactions in the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this portion, in particular,
we expect to be very sensitive to CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's a robust coenzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is we see this
very wide comb width.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the difference between the
start of the train.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wait a half second between the flash
trains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we reopen the system partially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we fill it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a measure of how much electrons
come in and are taken out during the flash
[SPEAKER_02]: train.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the overall monitoring that
we're going to do with samples from
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellowstone in the ambient environment as
well as the extreme CO2 environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this summarizes what we are monitoring
with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, this is the rise in
variable fluorescence, which is for us a
[SPEAKER_02]: signal of the Kelvin cycle activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the comb width that shows us the
ratio between the light reactions that
[SPEAKER_02]: push the electrons in and the utilization
of dark reactions that use NADPH and
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore reopen the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's see what happens when we.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is still an ambient sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just used to 400 ppm CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're exposing it to 6,000 ppm as
the samples we found in Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this sample clearly responds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we expected, especially this last
phase associated with the uptake of NADPH,
[SPEAKER_02]: the utilization in the Kelvin cycle
responds very strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see all the levels rising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the system stays much more open.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electrons just flow through much
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, even between trains,
we don't fully close the system anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: because the electrons can really be pumped
forward very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is sort of what we expected as a
very strong effect of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also see that the initial levels are
rising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even very early on, electrons are
already being taken out of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can be used downstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So strong acceleration of the reactions in
the electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Faster rise, faster overall levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to do the same thing,
but we're going to look at plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellowstone National Park that have grown
in this extremely high CO2 environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were always exposed to 6,000 ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the first thing we see when we just
look at the plants samples is that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not doing great in the high CO2
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see strong signs of chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the leaf sizes that are smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the overall plant looks very
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're going to do the same
experiments looking at the fluorescent
[SPEAKER_02]: signal from these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first we take the adapted plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call it adapted plants that
has grown in 6,000 ppm CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to give it just 400 ppm
CO2 and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what we see is sort of the
start of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start out with a dark adapted
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we start reducing QA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start filling the PQ pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of looks the same, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The signals go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come up a little bit, but then they
close again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this second phase that we associate
with E-Kalvin cycle activity, we basically
[SPEAKER_02]: see nothing happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The signal stays down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like it's not activating the
Kalvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not able to take the electrons out of
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the system stays closed all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now let's see what happens if
we give it 6,000 ppm CO2, like what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boom, we see more or less the same
response as in the ambient sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as we give it plenty of CO2,
it can fully restore the Kalvin cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overall levels reached are,
as you can see, more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we see this much narrower comb
width.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also between the trains, it can really
very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is able to re-oxidize the system each
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only slight difference that we see is
that we see a sort of a down-going slope
[SPEAKER_02]: here towards the end of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some kind of downstream
limitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here that starts to play a role,
which we attribute to, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Kalvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not only need to fix CO2,
but for that we use ribulose-based
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphate that needs to be regenerated
through the cycle in order to take up the
[SPEAKER_02]: next CO2 molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that is a limitation in that
downstream step for regenerating
[SPEAKER_02]: ribulose-based phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can accelerate the
carboxylation reaction, but you need the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the cycle to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what could be going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now this is a slide that
summarizes the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far I've been showing results for
single samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the box plots summarize data for the
replicates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three to six replicates for
each of these groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have an adaptive group, and we have
a control group exposed to 400 ppm,
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed to 6,000 ppm, just like the
observation data is just showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to summarize the
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, when we look at phase one,
so the start of the experiment,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dark adapted sample, we look at what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The maximum quantum yield of PS2,
we basically see no significant difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between the box plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So meaning that there's no significant
difference between control and adaptive
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 doesn't have an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we look at the PQ pool size,
so the next step, we reduce QA,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we reduce the PQ pool,
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where the signal goes down in
the first train.
[SPEAKER_02]: That difference is also more or less the
same, no significant difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: the groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we look at what we've called
phase two, so we saw the signal going down
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an intermediate downstream
bottleneck where what we think is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening, the full chain gets reduced,
so NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: NADPH gets formed and waiting to be
utilized by the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we get a sort of intermediate
stop or slowing down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we see that happening more or less
similarly for all the groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: No clear CO2 effect, no clear effect
between the different sample groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then for phase three, we clearly see,
as we saw in this, and if you remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was this very wide cone width and
the levels weren't rising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much lower Kelvin cycle activity for
the adaptive plant in ambient CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's restored in higher CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing for this, the cone width,
so the re-oxidation between the trains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we see a clear effect for the
adaptive plants compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: A clear CO2 effect to start with and
somewhat different between the control and
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing I mentioned is
this downstream limitation by
[SPEAKER_02]: ribulose-based phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also sort of see that starting to
appear mainly for the adapted samples and
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly exposed to high CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we see an adaptation
effect associated with the Kelvin cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: activity, but how can we explain it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly can be behind this
difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for that, we're going to look at the
various steps in the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way we often think about it is sort
of as a linear response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have more light, more NADPH ATP
being produced, more CO2 uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electrons flow through linearly and
then the products are used by the Kelvin
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do this, then the ratio of
ATP over NADPH that needs to be 3 to 2 is
[SPEAKER_02]: not correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the right ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to produce some extra ATP in
order to be able to run the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sort of solution that is invented
by nature to do this is called cyclic
[SPEAKER_02]: electron flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So electrons pass through the system,
reach a photosystem, from photosystem 2 to
[SPEAKER_02]: photosystem 1, and then the electron is
not transferred to reduce NADP plus to
[SPEAKER_02]: NADPH, but instead is cycled back,
thereby pumping an extra proton that can
[SPEAKER_02]: then be used to produce more ATP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all about tuning the linear versus
cyclic reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you would only do cyclic mode,
obviously you're not going to have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the trick then, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the plant is to make sure that these
two systems are tuned correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we think is going on,
or another thing I should say is that this
[SPEAKER_02]: has been shown in the literature is that
when plants are dark adapted, they start
[SPEAKER_02]: out in cyclic electron flow mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they start out in this mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of makes sense that at the start,
the first thing they start to do is to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce ATP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ATP can be used for a lot of
purposes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's beneficial to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as soon as the system sort of
senses, I also need NADPH, it then turns
[SPEAKER_02]: on the linear electron flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a transition until you get the
right ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how we interpret our data is that
because we see this adaptive plant and we
[SPEAKER_02]: see it's not activating the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very likely that it is in cyclic
mode, but when it doesn't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2, it doesn't see sort of a reason to
kick on linear flow, because there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: very low Kelvin cycle activity,
it stays in cyclic mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could explain why we don't see a
rise in fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as soon as we give it 6000 ppm,
it does start Kelvin cycle activity that
[SPEAKER_02]: starts needing NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do see the rise in
fluorescence, we see the system opening
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, to summarize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've seen for the CO2 adapted
plants, prunella plants in Yellowstone,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we expose it to 400 ppm, so much
lower than its growth environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see that the Kelvin cycle basically
stays inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we interpret this as in this dark to
light induction that we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_02]: the system, the electron transport chain
stays in cyclic electron flow mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's very little linear flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's very little NADPH available for
the Kelvin cycle to do carboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the advantage of that would be for a
plant that grows in a stressful high CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: but also highly acidifying environment,
is that it is always ready to make a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of ATP, which it can use then for repair
and homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be an explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we give it 6000 ppm,
the Kelvin cycle does get active to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same level as the control plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this means that linear electron flow
must be activated now, right, as soon as
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get the right ratio in order
to be able to run the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is sort of confirmed by a next
set of experiments that we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had our three minute experiment,
180 trains, but we've repeated it sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: in a light fluctuation experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three minutes of light,
and then we have four minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just practical because we have to
change the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four minutes of dark, three minutes of
light, four minutes of dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also we start out this example,
I mean, we did lots of combinations but in
[SPEAKER_02]: this example we start out with ambient
exposure, 400 ppm, two sequences,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we elevate CO2 to 6000 ppm and we do
another two sequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you think, if you look at this
with having in mind that we start out with
[SPEAKER_02]: cyclic flow, so we start out with a system
that closes very rapidly and then it opens
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the, the upper level is the control
plant, right, so it opens up, meaning it's
[SPEAKER_02]: transitioned to more linear electron flow
so that it can do Kelvin, so that it can
[SPEAKER_02]: do carboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this does not happen in the adaptive
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if we wait for a minute in the dark,
we sort of get part restoration of this
[SPEAKER_02]: cyclic electron flow mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at the control plant,
it's able to start up cycle, Kelvin cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: activity very fast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the minimum remains much higher,
so meaning the system is already active,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's able to stay much more open.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this doesn't happen in the control
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in ambient, which we didn't expect,
but even when we give it a lot of CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see the control plant being able to
stay almost completely open, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it hardly going down, so the system
doesn't get reduced, it can reopen
[SPEAKER_02]: straight away, meaning that directly it
establishes this balance, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: between cyclic and linear electron flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so for the adaptive plant,
right, if we dark, if we give it a dark
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure for a minute, we see the levels
going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It closes again from the start of the
experiment, and it needs time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does open with 6,000 ppm, but it takes
much longer for it to activate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it again, and we see the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we also see is this negative slope
starts to appear, right, as we continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: expose to light, this downstream
limitation starts to become more
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it looks like based on this
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this sort of fits the picture,
right, with the two experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, to summarize our conclusions for
the Pronella plant, yeah, I'll just show
[SPEAKER_02]: them here, 400 ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw no activity on the Kelvin cycle,
what we think is caused by the system
[SPEAKER_02]: staying in cyclic electron flow mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: 6,000 ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw no evidence of effect on the light
reactions, right, on the PS2 light
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we see is a change in the transition
from linear to cyclic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this should be the other way around,
I'm very sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: From cyclic to linear flow, when we go
from dark to light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much slower, right, this is closed in
between, and only then could it activate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it becomes almost as active,
more or less as active as the control
[SPEAKER_02]: plant eventually, which also tells us that
there is not really an adaptation in
[SPEAKER_02]: functional Robisco content, because this
has been an explanation, a possible
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation for adaptation to higher CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you would adjust your Robisco
content, right, because it doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: work as hard, and it has a lot more CO2
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it restores to the same level
as the control, we think that is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not what is happening in our adapted
samples here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also interesting to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that brings me to the end of my
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to thank a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, of course, Professor Charles
Dismukes from Rutgers University,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Waxman Institute, who introduced me to
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with whom I've been writing proposals
to get us to Yellowstone for these very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting experiments, which have been
supported by, of course, the National Park
[SPEAKER_02]: Service, who provided the research permit,
the Waxman Institute, who provided the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed grant to cover some of our travel
costs, and the Fort U Federation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands, who provided some of the
instrumentation we have been using in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Bill.
[SPEAKER_10]: How widely dispersed is this elevated CO2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the high CO2 sources, you mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meter scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, meter scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very, very localized.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you're, say, more than 10
meters away, in most cases, the levels are
[SPEAKER_02]: back to, also because of the air mixing,
you're back to ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is convenient, because we're
sort of quite certain that, other than
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2, the plants are exposed to the same
environment, same soils, everything else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I was wondering, you know,
sometimes we see that when plants are in
[SPEAKER_08]: those conditions, right, they're exposed
to extremely high CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not necessarily adapted,
but if you were to have a plant that was,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, synthetically, or just that,
yeah, in a plant that has a very high CO2
[SPEAKER_08]: environment, there's triose phosphate
utilization and limitation that occurs,
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, that could also limit the
rate of postinesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do you hypothesize that as some role
in what you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another downstream limitation that
could explain what we're seeing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially very high CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a high production of sugars,
and if they're not moving out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: system fast enough, then that also
inhibits the ribulophus phosphate
[SPEAKER_02]: regeneration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: A colleague and I have been sort of
thinking about doing some work at
[SPEAKER_09]: Yellowstone, also with high CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we've been spending
some time thinking about is that these
[SPEAKER_09]: emissions are not just CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other gases that are in there
that also can affect the soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your adapted plant didn't look very
healthy, and I was wondering whether you
[SPEAKER_09]: had any concerns about these other
stresses that the plant is under in
[SPEAKER_09]: interpreting any of your research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I should have mentioned that we
selected these sites because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: almost exclusively emitting CO2 and very
low in sulfuric gases, other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: gases, also relatively low in water vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the sources emit 90% water vapor
and then a tiny bit of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were really selected, the
travertine deposits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really emit mostly CO2 as a gas
and very low in other gas compounds that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be confusing our signal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you do the monitoring of the
emissions?
[SPEAKER_09]: USGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the USGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're taking from their reports.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you study any light intensity based
cycles which could be different in these
[SPEAKER_07]: two different environments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, we always use the same light schemes
for the fluorescence measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't played around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing we could do,
play around with different light
[SPEAKER_02]: intensities and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on our data, it's very clear there
is sort of acclimation or adaptation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think your data, I think all the
conclusions are dependent on the
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence data.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, when you compare chlorophyll
fluorescence at 400 ppm versus 6,000 ppm,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the first case, you have
photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the second, at 6,000 ppm,
photorespiration probably is completely
[SPEAKER_03]: inhibited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the total electron transport measured
by chlorophyll fluorescence, you have
[SPEAKER_03]: these two sinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is carbon dioxide reduction?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other is oxygenation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you differentiate those two?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second question, you suggested that the
amount of rubisco didn't change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never measured rubisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we did not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really don't feel comfortable with
that conclusion because without directly
[SPEAKER_03]: measuring rubisco, the total amount,
it would be very difficult to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusion that our rubisco amount didn't
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because chlorophyll fluorescence is an
indirect measurement.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you are measuring is measuring the
light reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not a direct measurement of rubisco
mediating dark reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's exactly why I put functional
rubisco to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we didn't measure rubisco content.
[SPEAKER_02]: But functional rubisco, because if the
functional rubisco content would be very
[SPEAKER_02]: different, the samples would not be
reaching the same variable fluorescence
[SPEAKER_02]: levels that we're seeing in the
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be differences when they're
exposed to the same levels of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we're pretty confident that
this is the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a way to directly measure the
functional rubisco portion.
[SPEAKER_03]: To measure the initial activity,
that represents the amount of rubisco that
[SPEAKER_03]: is active, actively engaged in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can measure the total amount of
rubisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the total amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the ratio is called activation,
percentage of activation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could directly measure the initial
activity of rubisco to support this
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusion, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, of course, here we are in
Yellowstone National Park with very
[SPEAKER_02]: limited facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we build up sort of an improvised lab
to do these experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not easy to do every kind of
measurement that would be ideal to confirm
[SPEAKER_02]: all the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do plan to do is to go back with
an instrument that can also measure the
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidation state of P700, so photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to measure the proton gradients,
which you can all do with optical
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're relatively feasible for this
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, we could corroborate some of
these conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I agree, it's only one method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hope to fill some of the holes with
these additional measurements in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Laurie?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of agree it would be really great
if we could project the hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_05]: was involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And understanding the field limitations
there, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a very naive question about what
you're measuring with the fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it rubisco activity, or is it
essentially like IRDP reduction?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the regeneration phase that's being
measured?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we measure is a net rate of uptake of
electrons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's when the NAD, et cetera,
has been.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's when it's going from 3PGA to
G3P, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's measuring the rate of IRDP
regeneration, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is consistent with when you're
seeing that downshift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's becoming limiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just thought in my head, whether that
is a proxy for rubisco activity or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe the terminology you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, correct my terminology if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we really measure is the
re-oxidation of NADPH by the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we see strong CO2 effect sort of
confirms that it has to do with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I shouldn't call it rubisco activity,
because that is not what we measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The correct term is re-oxidation of NADPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of the inability of the adaptive
plants to efficiently use the ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of CO2 do you think is related to
the chlorosis and the general lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: health of the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it would just be harder in general
for it to photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's in this high CO2 environment,
it's always exposed to 6,000 ppm,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be able to do photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that would not be causing the
chlorosis that we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, on the other hand, the CO2 levels are
fluctuating because of air mixing,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that would definitely be part of the
stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then it would be exposed sometimes
to this very nice and high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it goes down, it goes up,
it goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that would be part of the
explanation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is on that part right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you take the adaptive plants and
they're at the lower ppm, that's where you
[SPEAKER_06]: see the cycle kick in, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're generating too much ATP
relative to NADP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does that ATP go if it doesn't go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does it get shunted if it doesn't
get used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is something I think a lot of
you people know more about than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ATP is used for a lot of processes in
living cells as an energy carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it gets shuttled out, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I would say maybe that's
part of the toxicity, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's getting shunted into something
that is hurting the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ATP itself, you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the other thing I wanted to ask
you is about, so you have this swath of
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant that's getting the high dosage
and then the adjacent swath is the
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you take the high adapt and you put
it in a 400 ppm and just keep it there
[SPEAKER_06]: forever, does it ever acclimate back to
400?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a very interesting question.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, I mean, so it would be hard to
do in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we would need to be sure to be
able to come back every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a very short season because
we're at more than 2,000 feet,
[SPEAKER_02]: 6,000 feet altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something we're thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can bring the plants out of the,
it is included in our permit now that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can bring plants back from the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could see if in the greenhouse
or in growth chambers, we expose them to
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 ppm and whether they react.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be very interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if it's elastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also just to move the 400 into
600 until you see a decline, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the first part of the hypothesis
was that CO2 can be detrimental at high,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then to model that breakdown,
basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we need to find funding
for, though, because that's going to be an
[SPEAKER_02]: extended set of experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking back about the plants again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there plants that are growing into my
CO2 environment that actually look
[SPEAKER_10]: healthy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the ones that you did show,
they look pretty ragged.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm trying to imagine the leaves that
you would look at to do these experiments.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they have healthy leaves in these
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, some of the leaves do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this kind of measurement,
do we need only a small portion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf to be healthy to do our measurements?
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the one, I don't think,
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pretty crappy example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just before we go back to the crowd,
we have one quick one here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to just say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a question from the Zoom audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you notice any differences in stomatal
conductance at different CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is sort of the nice thing
about prunella is that it didn't respond
[SPEAKER_02]: very strongly in terms of stomatal
conductance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took stomatal conductance
measurements in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we brought samples to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't see strong differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, stomatal conductance, there's a
lot of variability to start with when you
[SPEAKER_02]: measure it in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that degree of variability and range
didn't change for samples controlled or
[SPEAKER_02]: adapted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when we brought them to the lab,
the conductance got smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the stomata did stay open and also to
a similar degree, more or less,
[SPEAKER_02]: within the variability range that is
inherent to the measurement.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sort of mentioned this before.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to ask again, how far
apart were the exposed plants and the
[SPEAKER_09]: controlled plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Automatically to 10 meters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 meters, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is 10, 12 yards, or 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that's?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think your control plants were
really controlled plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the wind is blowing this stuff
every which direction.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they're only 30 feet apart,
my guess is that at some point,
[SPEAKER_09]: your control plants were being exposed to
elevated CO2 also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather the other way around,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a point source of very high
CO2.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants growing very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very close to that point source do get the
6,000 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the stuff came up out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Within a foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow directly at the edge of the
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the soil is not hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are not hot sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really CO2 sources.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 6,000, is that the extreme that was
identified?
[SPEAKER_08]: If consistently around 6,000 around these
pathways is?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the level that we measured out in
the field at about 6,000 PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some sites where they found
up to 10,000 in the USGS reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those sites had no growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: No vegetative growth around them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just wondering, if you were to
measure with, I'm not sure if this is by
[SPEAKER_08]: your design or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you measured in sites that had
lower, like 2,000 and 3,000, so some of
[SPEAKER_08]: the gas exchange systems can ramp up CO2
to about 3,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: You compromise some of the extremity,
I guess, of the CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, you'd be able to
actually get net CO2 assimilation and get
[SPEAKER_08]: the direct parameters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that would be something you'd
be interested in doing in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is actually what we intended to
do when we went.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought about measuring along a
transect over a range of CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this turned out to be hard,
exactly for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to get something of a
stable CO2 concentration transient in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field with all the other variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we stuck to very high, very close to
the source, and then ambient far enough
[SPEAKER_02]: from the source that we had a stable
ambient.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did do, I can show you that data,
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pronella is a common plant, so you can
actually just order it and grow it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here we did the range of CO2
experiments where we start out with an
[SPEAKER_02]: ambient signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here we expose it to just zero
CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see this last phase, basically,
system staying closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a couple of intermediate
levels, so 1,600, 3,000, and 6,000 ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are lab-grown samples now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we were able to control a lot
more things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're grown in ambient CO2,
and we looked at the CO2 effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get an idea of what it looks like,
what the intermediate levels look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of connected to a question about
elasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you saw the difference between
the control and the adaptive samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have an idea of how much of the
difference you thought was due to actual
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary adaptation, and how much was
due to the acclimation of just being
[SPEAKER_01]: raised in this environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if we could do all the
genetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't bring samples from the field in
the times we went.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so the re-acclimation experiment would
be one to do to see if we can confirm
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimation versus adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably easier even than the genetics,
because I don't know how well the genome
[SPEAKER_02]: of Brunella is known.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that might be very hard to trace back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something that would be very
cool to do, to confirm which of the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do one more and then look.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also want to say there's the
student punch in command 413.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just down the hall.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had your hand up a couple of times
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that and then close it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice any changes in density of
the Brunella as you approached the CO2
[SPEAKER_07]: source as compared to more control
populations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak up a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice any changes in the density
of the Brunella as you approached the CO2
[SPEAKER_07]: source as compared to the control?
[SPEAKER_02]: The density, you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: What findings?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so few plants growing very close
to these sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll keep an eye out and see if that is
something we can get a good observation
[SPEAKER_02]: of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do one more round of applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
