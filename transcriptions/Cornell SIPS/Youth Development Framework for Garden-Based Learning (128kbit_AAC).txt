[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for having me at your
meeting today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to be here and so
excited to hear about all the great work
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing with youth in your
county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really great to get the
introductions that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that we've really been trying
to do in the state 4-H team is to connect
[SPEAKER_01]: our 4-H resources across Extension because
we realize there are a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension that are working with youth but
may not necessarily see their connection
[SPEAKER_01]: to 4-H or the value of the connection to
4-H that's happening at the state level
[SPEAKER_01]: and the local level too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited that you guys are
all part of the team and that we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this great work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably start to begin by
introducing myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alexa Mailey and I am the state
STEM specialist here on campus in Beebe
[SPEAKER_01]: Hall and I call myself a science nerd all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing this kind of science learning
stuff but I came to campus by working in
[SPEAKER_01]: the local level mostly in Clinton County
and we did a lot of work with local foods
[SPEAKER_01]: there and connecting gardening activities
with nutrition and healthy living and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the kinds of projects that you guys are
talking about I really enjoy doing at the
[SPEAKER_01]: local level too and I'm hoping we can
build this up across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: National Council has this fun new brand
campaign all about 4-H growth here and one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things National Council is really
good at is translating our 4-H story into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's interesting for youth and
their families that isn't just Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the reasons why the STEM
plan that I'm working on right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: framed in the idea of growth here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's particularly fitting when we talk
about gardening and also when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about growing young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all kinds of information about why
STEM matters, things you've probably heard
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many jobs out there that are
STEM related.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's not enough people going for
them or they're all white men.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough women.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough minorities all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can play with some numbers if you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I really want to show you is this
which is 4-H grows curiosity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason that I love STEM learning so much
is because I love questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else like questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like learning something new, the challenge
of discovery of achieving based on
[SPEAKER_01]: something you've done with a group or that
light bulb moment that a young person is
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out something for the first time
or teaching it to someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that in 4-H all the time in the
garden, in the classroom, in the club
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, in the show ring, wherever we
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to do with my STEM plan
is to take the work that everybody's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: across the counties and connect it with a
common thread so that we can have a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell our story that's useful for inviting
new families and young people to become
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, to tell our story to funders and
stakeholders so that our programs can be
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and grow stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can learn from the programs that
we're doing so that we can do them even
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing a lot of talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in this position for a year or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing a lot of learning about
the different programs that are happening
[SPEAKER_01]: across the state and trying to figure out
what those common threads are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I've heard from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about it as a learning
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lots of different projects,
lots of different approaches and ways that
[SPEAKER_01]: this pathway might actually look like for
an individual, but these are common steps
[SPEAKER_01]: that we take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start out by sparking curiosity,
the idea of inviting a young person into
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember one, I think he was
maybe a fourth grader or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we brought him to a master gardener's
vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked us how we got the cucumbers
on the plants like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought that we had gone ahead of time
and glued them all to the plants so they
[SPEAKER_01]: were all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just so curious how it worked
and sparking that kind of wonder and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting young people see that there's
something new out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that in a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're hoping to build on that so
that we're providing opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: kids to answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe next time he would grow his own
plant and see that actually it comes that
[SPEAKER_01]: way first and then we take the cucumber
off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually these experiential
learning opportunities can lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: investigations or engineering design if
the science aspect of their experience is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they wanna do more of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might do some kind of experiment
about a pest that's bothering their
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumber plant and try to figure out a way
to help it grow stronger or to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pest or that kind of thing or design a
cage or tool or whatever it was that would
[SPEAKER_01]: solve the problem for their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not only that, we really want to
help young people make a difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially with the challenges
with climate change and food security and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these really huge things that we're
all facing, we need as many people as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to put their brain power and
their creativity and their curiosity to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve those kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And young people have really great ideas
for how to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard from some of your projects
that you've seen youth doing that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately that's our goal in the 4-H
program is to have youth and adults
[SPEAKER_01]: working together to make change for their
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what I'm really excited about
trying to help happen for 4-H in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the bigger picture,
we have a portfolio of different science
[SPEAKER_01]: and technology and engineering activities
and learning opportunities for young
[SPEAKER_01]: people to be able to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what I think about as our
program portfolio or if you like the logic
[SPEAKER_01]: model idea, these are our inputs and our
outputs and our outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our outcomes and those kinds of ideas,
the big picture ecosystem of our STEM
[SPEAKER_01]: learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kids can do just about anything in 4-H,
but it does help us as professionals to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to focus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have certain projects and activities
that are particularly strong in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State compared to other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our plant science and animal science
and those kinds of projects, our
[SPEAKER_01]: geospatial projects and drones and those
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're working on some emerging
technologies, new project areas for youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So computer coding and sustainable
polymers and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these project areas you may
work in and some of them you may not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the underlying experience in each one
of these topic areas could still follow
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow curiosity pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: With our ultimate goal is that with young
people building on that curiosity to see
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves as science people and maybe
want to explore science careers or do
[SPEAKER_01]: service work in their community using
science to solve problems, but ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: helping them to be good citizens and to
think about information in that way where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're checking their evidence and making
good decisions and that kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the picture that's in the middle of
this, the circles are based out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive youth development model by
Richard Lerner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are three things that his
research shows that young people really
[SPEAKER_01]: need in order to thrive and those three
things 4-H really provides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a skill building opportunity,
a long-term caring adult and meaningful
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why this particular picture and
ecosystem is shaped in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you leading a community garden program
or engaging with the libraries,
[SPEAKER_01]: provide that caring relationship with a
young person that is really foundational
[SPEAKER_01]: to everything that we need to do in youth
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the volunteers that you work with and
the master gardeners and mentors in those
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are really foundational for making that
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's our job as a system to help
each other do that better and to help our
[SPEAKER_01]: youth take a leadership role in that way
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also a peer mentoring experience
and it's building up the social capital of
[SPEAKER_01]: our entire system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then part of that comes from
organizational culture change and
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthening and growth as we all
practice these science activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activities more and practices and learning
about how to ask questions that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: answered with evidence and sharing our
evidence and learning from our programs
[SPEAKER_01]: together, that kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also just mentioned all the work that we
do through extension that engages youth is
[SPEAKER_01]: 4-H work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just be curious to see what you
guys think about this idea of growing
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity and if it fits in with the work
that you're doing in community gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: school gardens and with master gardeners
or if there's anything that's really far
[SPEAKER_01]: off base or changes you would make or
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts you have about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like pictures to explain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I particularly like this too because it
also can provide a framework for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our efforts with children and youth
audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were doing program with youth,
how do we fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we fit into this pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we coming at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a nice framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think it's really important to
have conversations and to build up
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships between staff members.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I worked in Clinton County,
we had the advantage of being really
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to run into each other at the
coffee pot and whatever and talk and share
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn about each other's programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a bigger county, that's harder to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something we all have
to be intentional about so that anytime I
[SPEAKER_01]: would want to do a program that would
involve gardening or an agriculture kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of angle, it would be good to check in
with Ag staff to see what they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and if there's anything that relates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you and your horticulture program are
doing something that you'd like to engage
[SPEAKER_01]: young people with, the 4-H staff in your
office need to know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's practical for you because they might
have some resources that are helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: already that maybe you know about,
but maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also structural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our youth numbers and reporting
and everything has to go through the 4-H
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your 4-H staff can help you figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really something that we should be
working on as a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prefer a personal approach,
just stopping by or calling up or emailing
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever the 4-H person in your office
to say, hey, this is what I'm doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: how can we work together kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my experience, it seems like that's
happening pretty well in a majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like any relationship, it's definitely
something that takes consistent work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're presenting to us here about
curiosity grows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that 4-H educators
across the state would also be introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be a little bit of common
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a relatively new framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started introducing it to 4-H staff at
state fair last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also going to talk about it some
more during the spring in-service.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth here language is part of
national council stuff that 4-H staff see
[SPEAKER_01]: on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have fun graphics and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing recruitment posters and
you need that kind of support that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all sort of learning through this
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then comes reporting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does that come in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I noticed somewhere down in
the 5.8 section that there were spots for
[SPEAKER_02]: master gardeners doing outreach towards
the issues of childhood obesity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, working with our 4-H
educator here trying to figure out who
[SPEAKER_02]: gets credit for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it belong in our reporting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing it together as an
organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, it can get confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is really good, I think,
to kind of work that out ahead of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more of a comment than a question,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's definitely something
that we keep wrestling with and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a better answer for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're all trying to tell the best
story we can about the impact that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so much of our work is integrated,
whether it's across program areas or even
[SPEAKER_01]: topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within 4-H there are three focus areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our programming around STEM,
healthy living, and civic engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, the way the system is
set up, you have to choose one or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in reality, the program is both and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's stronger that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as far as the plan of work
reporting for Celeste and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, it mostly matters that it's not
duplicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one person is reporting it and that
it's in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we talk about it with the public,
then we use the both and kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the reason that we're looking
at the state team at our plan of work and
[SPEAKER_01]: our strategy moving forward is that if we
have a more consistent core, then we can
[SPEAKER_01]: develop evaluation and reporting tools to
support the system at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that every person doesn't have to make
up an evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have a few shared questions or
tools or a toolbox of choices for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited this year for the
first time to have a 4-H spring
[SPEAKER_01]: in-service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're stealing heavily from the ag
in-service title.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really liked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're copying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea is that we'll have a
three-day conference where educators from
[SPEAKER_01]: across the state can come together to
focus on youth development needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this grew out of a club management
conference that we've had for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, which really focused on community
club delivery model kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be a strong element in the
program this year, all about volunteer
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a huge part of our community
club work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also going to have a section
around building campus county connections,
[SPEAKER_01]: work around professional development for
youth development professionals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and another one around communicating the
impact of our 4-H work.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Wednesday, the 13th of April,
which is the first day of the conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have a special lunch slash
conversation opportunity where we really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to bring together people from local
county programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: With campus faculty and extension partners
to have conversations and learn about your
[SPEAKER_01]: programs and build connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really hoping that that will tie in
with the work that you're doing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture in-service, that you'll stay
another day and have lunch with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn a little bit more about our 4-H
program at the state level, what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're welcome to come to the entire
conference too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so the youth development in-service
will be April 13th at 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: until April 15th at noon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a Wednesday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in-service is on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we would have, are
contemplating the idea of having Tuesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: April 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe from 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning till 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a horticulture in-service.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm thinking about as we're talking
and looking at all the faces who,
[SPEAKER_02]: or not faces, names who showed up today,
that more and more often we are working
[SPEAKER_02]: with youth and we are, you know,
we're integrating nutrition, vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening concepts into our programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, speaking from my own
perspective, we did not used to do a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of work with youth and families.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that all of us could probably
benefit from, you know, hanging out
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps an extra day and seeing what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that was one of the ideas was
to, you know, have them close together,
[SPEAKER_02]: adjacent, so that we could get some
crossover in both directions and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: room there is for collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, too, would invite them to come the day
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who is maybe in the youth
development area or nutrition area who's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I need to know a little bit more
about what happens in the gardening or
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture area, they could,
an individual could attend our in-service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even planned what we would have
at that in-service, but we think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good day to start thinking about what we
could have.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
