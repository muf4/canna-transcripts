[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got a few things I want to go
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly, this is just information for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have questions at any time,
stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to talk as much as you guys
want about any particular topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I'll start telling you a
little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my family didn't have a lot of people
that went to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a few that ended up in nursing
school, but certainly nobody who went to
[SPEAKER_02]: grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really interested in science in
high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do when you like science in
high school, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, OK, I'll try to be a doctor,
because that's what you do when you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know anything about academia or research
or science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to school thinking I was a
pre-med.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the more I get into it,
the more I learn, the more I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, maybe that's not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I volunteered in a hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, I got a job working
in a lab on campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing research with streptococcus mutans,
which probably most of you have in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Causes cavities, hopefully not in your
mouth right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely loved the microbiology
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely hated working in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not really fond of hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea of being a doctor just was
like, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more I got into the research,
the more I realized I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then from there, it's like I got an
advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was working with somebody in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: A professor who was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, yeah, there's lots of things
you can do with a PhD in microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do all of these interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't think I wanted to be a
professor when I went to grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I wanted to work in the biotech
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, I wanted to clean up
contamination in the environment using
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as I learned more about myself
and as I learned more about microbiology,
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized I was really fascinated in
microbial ecology and what happens in
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that basically led me to where I am
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's part of the process of
deciding if you want to go to grad school
[SPEAKER_02]: or figuring out what you want to do right
now is getting experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting internships, like maybe at the
botanical garden or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking time to figure out what excites you
and narrowing down the list of things you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do with your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's hopefully what you guys are
thinking about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'll be able to help you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my job today is mostly to give you
some idea about what grad school is all
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're interested in it,
how you might get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few things I want to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is grad school all about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to go to grad school?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can do to prepare to go to grad
school?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how that whole admissions process
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll sort of take them on in that
order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is grad school?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grad school is, it's basically training to
become good at doing research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grad school is much more focused than
undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in undergraduate, you're doing credits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking courses primarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other things you're doing,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're getting your degree because of
the coursework and credits that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 120 credits you've got to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to satisfy all these
criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't really exist in grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grad school is about doing some kind of
original research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like finding something where you're
going to make an individual impact in a
[SPEAKER_02]: new way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you take courses in grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there aren't many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly focused on a real,
practical, experiential learning exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real goal of grad school,
you're going to have some focused area
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're becoming an expert in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real unifying theme is you're
learning how to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're learning how to design research,
how to perform research, and how to answer
[SPEAKER_02]: a question that it's not something you can
just look up in a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of questions out there that
we don't have the answers to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to grad school is getting the skills
it takes to be able to answer those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't look up in a textbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you can write your own textbook
someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of grad school, there's a few
different degrees you might hear about or
[SPEAKER_02]: think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an MPS degree, which is a master's
of professional studies, professional
[SPEAKER_02]: service studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit less common in the
sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, it's more coursework focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually a shorter program,
one or two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually, it's for somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in going into
industry and you want to be a CEO for a
[SPEAKER_02]: company that makes fertilizer or one of
these big ag biotech companies like Bayer
[SPEAKER_02]: Crop Sciences or something like that,
and you're going to be a manager,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you really want to know a lot about
soil science so you can understand what
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who work for you are doing,
that might make sense to do an MPS in soil
[SPEAKER_02]: science, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're focusing on a particular area to
improve your knowledge in that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're not going to go on to be a
professor in that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: A master's degree is very much still a
research degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're doing there is learning
how to be a scientist, maybe more than
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how to direct a research program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to be able to direct a
research program either in industry or
[SPEAKER_02]: academia, you really need the PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the PhD is sort of like you're able to
identify new research topics, design a
[SPEAKER_02]: research program to answer that question,
get the funding to do it, manage it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then get a positive outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with a master's degree,
it's more like, well, you're able to do
[SPEAKER_02]: research, but you might not be in a
position to sort of come up with new ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: or sort of direct a whole research
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions about those sort of
different degrees?
[SPEAKER_02]: A master's is usually two, maybe three
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: A PhD can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fastest I've seen somebody finish is
like four and a half years, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest I've seen somebody take was eight
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the eight-year student spent a lot of
time abroad, and he did lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting things, so he was using his
time well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible to do a PhD without a
master's?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that varies by field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are slight cultural
differences and practices across different
[SPEAKER_02]: fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a microbiologist or a plant
biologist or a chemist, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see some differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, the way I like to describe
it is if you're in a laboratory-based
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, like you're doing bench work
in the lab all day, those people typically
[SPEAKER_02]: go right from the bachelor's degree to a
PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't usually get a master's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas people who do field work,
either ecology, natural resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant sciences, those people, it's more
likely that you're going to get a master's
[SPEAKER_02]: degree before you get the PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be more expected that you do
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant science is kind of funny because
some of the plant biologists are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics in the lab all day, and then
we've got people in horticulture who are
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the field all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're generally going to see those
field people, it's more common that
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll have a master's before the PhD,
whereas the bench people, it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently everybody just gets the PhD
without a master's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to some degree, it varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my own personal, I've never heard a
good explanation for why that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the best guess I have is that if
you're in a bench science program,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of those research jobs tend to be
directing research rather than performing
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to direct research,
you need a PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a master's degree isn't quite as
marketable if you're in a bench type
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in those field-based environments,
there are many more sort of management
[SPEAKER_02]: level positions, whether with government
or extension, where that master's degree
[SPEAKER_02]: is a pretty marketable thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like it's kind of market
driven, but yeah, that is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so if you have an advisor,
if you're thinking about grad school in a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular area, you should ask or try to
figure out what the particulars are for
[SPEAKER_02]: that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why might you want to go to grad
school?
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, in the sciences, you should
really like science and really be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some other good reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a good reason in terms of
salary, if that sort of thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's sort of this old saw out there
that if you get too much education,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to get a job, or maybe you
educate yourself out of a job,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the statistics from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: national US statistics, if you get a
doctoral degree, not a medical degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a PhD, over your lifetime,
you're likely to get 43% more salary than
[SPEAKER_02]: if you just have a bachelor's alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the unemployment rate, at least,
as of 2015, for people with a PhD is 1.7%,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is about a third of the unemployment
rate for people who have a bachelor's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a PhD, you're more
employable, and you're gonna earn more
[SPEAKER_02]: money, if that matters to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with a master's, the unemployment
rate for a master's is 2.4%, which is like
[SPEAKER_02]: half of the unemployment rate right now
for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with a master's, you're gonna get
18% higher salary over your lifetime than
[SPEAKER_02]: someone just with a bachelor's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested in science,
if you're thinking about these things are
[SPEAKER_02]: important to you, yeah, it's a good idea
to think about grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is, in the sciences,
it's mostly free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go to get a PhD, if you go to
get a master's or a research degree at a
[SPEAKER_02]: university, generally, you're going to get
your tuition covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your tuition is gonna be paid for by
the program, or by a fellowship,
[SPEAKER_02]: or some other method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a teaching assistantship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to actually get paid to
go to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna get a living stipend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a ton of money, but it's enough
to pay all your bills and cover your
[SPEAKER_02]: health insurance and everything you need
while you're in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pretty good deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up with getting your education
paid for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also end up making more money over
your lifetime, and you have a lower
[SPEAKER_02]: unemployment rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think it's something you're
interested in, it can be a good choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions about all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so then the other thing is,
how do you prepare?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can you do to prepare for grad
school?
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of preparing for grad school,
and in terms of your application,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are really three things that
you want to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things is your coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have already picked majors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking about majors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking about your concentration,
probably, if you're in the plant sciences
[SPEAKER_02]: major.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's gonna really dictate your
coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that coursework is, of course,
important, but probably the single most
[SPEAKER_02]: important thing in terms of grad school is
real world experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my case, I volunteered in a
hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that research in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined the lab as a junior, and I worked
throughout my junior and senior years,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had one whole summer where I was
working on the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real world experiences, so like
internships, working in the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: independent research credits, honors
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be just in one lab,
but those experiences are gonna help you
[SPEAKER_02]: to know what you like and what interests
you, but they're also gonna really help to
[SPEAKER_02]: give you the skills you're gonna need and
sort of develop your background so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get into graduate school if that's
a choice you wanna make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing to mention there
in terms of real world experience is a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people like to take a gap year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get your bachelor's, and then maybe
you're not ready to go right into grad
[SPEAKER_02]: school, or maybe for some reason you think
there's something you can improve about
[SPEAKER_02]: your preparation for grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people will get a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a job as a technician.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a job on a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people go into the Peace Corps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sorts of experiences, if they're
related to your area of interest,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're related to your professional
sort of educational goals and why you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grad school, those kind of
experiences are generally gonna help you,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're making an application
for grad school, those people wanna know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you really interested in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have skills?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're gonna develop that interest
and get those skills, not just in the
[SPEAKER_02]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those real world experiences are
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a freshman, if you're a
sophomore, it's definitely a good time to
[SPEAKER_02]: be thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a transfer student coming in
maybe later on, definitely you wanna try
[SPEAKER_02]: to get some of those experiences as soon
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are lots of different ways to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing I wanted to talk about
is admissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I start talking about
admissions, you guys are really quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you must have some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that if you have a question,
there are probably 10 people in the room
[SPEAKER_02]: who have the same question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be really helpful maybe if
somebody would ask, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're asking the question from your
point of view, like where do I wanna send
[SPEAKER_02]: my application?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a ton of programs out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be hard to navigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say the first thing you need
to do is figure out what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your interests?
[SPEAKER_02]: That old question that people ask you that
you hate to get, what do you wanna be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing you need to do is answer
that question real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I say get experiences,
because getting those experiences will
[SPEAKER_02]: help you to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know who you are before you
know where you wanna go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have that bit ready,
then I guess there would be two things to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first and probably most valuable thing
is hopefully you've been working with
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's your academic advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got somebody in a sort of
mentor kind of relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's Marvin here in this class.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got somebody who you can talk
to who has a network.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to that person and you say,
hey, I'm really interested in this area of
[SPEAKER_02]: study, they're gonna be able to tell you
probably off the top of your head,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, here's half a dozen programs you
might think about applying to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they don't, they probably know
somebody who could give you that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tap into that network.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're sort of doing research,
you're developing a network of
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tap into your network and ask them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll provide you really good
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there are other people you're
working with, whether it's an internship
[SPEAKER_02]: or in a lab, the graduate students,
ask them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of canvas your network and get
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is as you're
interested in this area, you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you get more and more interested,
you wanna do more and more reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're doing research, you're
probably getting papers to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're seeing scientific papers in
your classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you're just reading stuff on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those articles are gonna talk about the
science, but you're also gonna see the
[SPEAKER_02]: names of people who made those
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write those names down.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see an article that has a really
exciting conclusion, who's the senior
[SPEAKER_02]: author on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What institution are they at?
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep a list of the kinds of stuff that
you find exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then who did the work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe all the people doing this work are
at the University of Minnesota or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something you wanna know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're reading a lot of papers and
you find that all the papers you're
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about are written by five people,
you should probably apply to institutions
[SPEAKER_02]: where those five people are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look online.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be harder, but if you look for
plant science programs, not every place in
[SPEAKER_02]: the country has one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you find the ones that do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in a particular area,
look at the faculty bios and find a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might look at the Michigan State,
and if you're interested in a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: area, maybe they have only one person
really specializing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you read their background,
it looks really lame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you look at UC Davis and they
have five people in that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're all really dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'd wanna make that application
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say use your network,
do some reading, and then do that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: web-based search.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a question here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's tricky, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So funding is one of the big things,
and we could talk a long time about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's an important thing for grad
school, because you do get funded to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: grad school, but whether or not that
funding comes through is one of the big
[SPEAKER_02]: things that dictates whether or not you
get accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're getting accepted to an
undergraduate program, mostly they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at your merit, your GPA,
the coursework you did, they're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's certainly important for grad
school, but it's only one of the pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: for grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: This funding piece is really important,
because we don't have unlimited funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just pay for anybody to go to
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to figure out how to
provide that money for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really, in the bigger picture,
there's three ways, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fellowships, there's teaching
assistantships, and then there are faculty
[SPEAKER_02]: grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all three of these are the mechanisms
we use to fund students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're admitted, you might be
admitted with one kind of support,
[SPEAKER_02]: but over the course of a PhD, you might
actually move between all three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I admit 10 students, it's unlikely
that all 10 of those students will have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same kind of funding package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with fellowships, there are two basic
kinds, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's kinds that you apply for,
and there's kinds that the school you're
[SPEAKER_02]: applying to will nominate you for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ones that you apply for,
you have control over, but there aren't a
[SPEAKER_02]: ton of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like, the biggest one that you
guys should all know about is the National
[SPEAKER_02]: Science Foundation graduate fellowship
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really big program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's competitive, but if you get funded
there, it's fantastic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can almost guarantee that you're gonna
get accepted anywhere you apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get one of these NSF fellowships.
[SPEAKER_02]: The due dates are usually in the fall,
so you wanna plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would very much, if you're thinking
about going to grad school, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: wanna look at this and think carefully
about making an application.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are other things, like the Ford
Foundation has fellowship programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, does USCID still have
fellowship programs?
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of programs out there,
and you sorta have to look around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to be specialized.
[SPEAKER_02]: NSF is very broad, but there are a lot of
specialized programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna say the armed services have some
fellowship programs, maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: national labs do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to hunt around.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I would recommend, because it's
broad, and almost anybody could apply for
[SPEAKER_02]: it, is the NSF program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you apply for your own funding,
and you get that from that external
[SPEAKER_02]: agency, that travels with you no matter
where you go, and that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short of that, you don't have to have
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can apply to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: The school can nominate you for a
fellowship, like an internal fellowship,
[SPEAKER_02]: so Cornell has a lot of internal
fellowships we use for recruiting
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the director of graduate studies,
I get your application.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I see your application, I'm like,
ooh, this would be a great candidate for
[SPEAKER_02]: this funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna nominate you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't even know I nominated you for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't accept you, then okay,
I'll try to fund you some other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they do, then I'll send you a
letter that says, congratulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've received this fellowship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily know that that's
happening, but that's one way that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could fund you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of fellowships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the teaching assistantships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So faculty teach, we teach courses,
and so we need assistance with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so teaching assistantships are a way
that the university pays a graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: student so that for some of their time,
they're helping with teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's capped at how many hours a week
you can be expected to be teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the maximum is like 15 hours for
most assignments.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, you're spending a lot less
time than that actually teaching,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that would be a way to sort of pay
your salary and tuition as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sciences, you do a little bit less
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were in the humanities,
they don't have as many fellowships and
[SPEAKER_02]: grants as we do in the sciences usually,
and so they can spend a lot more teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: But TA-ships aren't that onerous in the
sciences usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that's one way I might be able to
provide your funding is my unit might have
[SPEAKER_02]: five or six TA-lines, and so that means
five or six people I can support with
[SPEAKER_02]: those TA-lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you wouldn't know anything
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I have so many slots I'm going to
try to put people in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the faculty grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Cornell doesn't give faculty any money
to do research, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They give us space and offices,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get hired, they give us some money
to buy equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they don't give us any more
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after that, if you want to do research,
you need to get grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So National Science Foundation,
USDA, Ag and Food Research Initiative,
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Energy, NASA, international
agencies, we need to hustle to get grant
[SPEAKER_02]: money to support our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest component of that money is
usually people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's salaries, it's tuition, it's health
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how we pay for a lot of grad
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's tricky because many of these
funding programs might reject 90% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: applications that you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a faculty member is constantly
submitting grant applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they can't always predict when one is
going to be funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe two get funded just by chance,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one year that faculty member might need
to admit two students, and then the next
[SPEAKER_02]: year they might admit none.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe three years in a row they might
admit none.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a source of funding,
but it's also somewhat unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make an application,
I can't tell you where your money is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come from, but I need to have a source
of money to admit you, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: fellowship or a teaching assistantship or
a faculty grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot that goes on there,
so I'm happy to answer any follow-up
[SPEAKER_02]: questions there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of then, in terms of
admissions and getting into graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: school, I would say that really there are
sort of three pieces to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one piece is sort of the merit of the
applicant, sort of what you bring to the
[SPEAKER_02]: equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second piece is something I would call
your fit with the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third piece is the funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we already talked a little bit
about the funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funding is usually a big constraint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that we usually get more
applicants who are high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I would say is that at
the graduate level, if I think there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable likelihood that you're going to
be successful in graduate school,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to be able to admit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously we use merit as a
criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want the best and brightest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I'm only going to exclude you
for sure if I don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be successful in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I think you're going to be successful,
I want to try to admit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason I can't admit everybody is
usually funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funding puts a cap on who we can admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're trying to admit the people
who have the highest merit and have the
[SPEAKER_02]: best fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can talk about merit in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this fit thing is interesting because
it gets back to the question you had
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier about where do you apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say maybe you didn't do your
homework when you decided where to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you applied to a university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're really interested in,
let's say you're really interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: using drones to measure plant health in
some way, which is a cool thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you apply to a university where
there's absolutely nobody working with
[SPEAKER_02]: drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they look at your application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, holy crap, this person
has an NSF fellowship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a 4.0 GPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got this wonderful internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to work with drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have anybody doing anything
with drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they should admit you?
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably would not be doing you any
favors by admitting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they admit you, they might
admit you because you're just a great
[SPEAKER_02]: applicant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have your own money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might hope that they could
convince you to work on something other
[SPEAKER_02]: than drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they don't have a faculty member
working on drones, and if that's what your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart beats for, you really have no
business going to that school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they should reject you because there's
no fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have somebody who can properly
advise you and direct you and mentor you
[SPEAKER_02]: in the area that makes you excited,
what you're trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say that in general,
fit is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're applying to a school and they
don't have expertise in that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more often what happens is you might be
applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say they do have somebody
working on drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that person is going to retire in a
few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they're retiring in a few
years, they're not taking students.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you're not likely to get accepted
because they can't suit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be nobody there to work
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say there's a couple of people
working at that program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of them just took five students
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't possibly take another
student.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be able to admit you
because they want you to work with those
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those people can't take students,
you're not going to get accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this fit question, they're going to
look at your application and try to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out who at this university would the
student be best suited to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can't find anybody who's well
suited to advise you, then they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to admit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're a great student,
even if you have funding, they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that fit piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's hard for you as an
applicant to predict that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can help yourself by doing your
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're applying to a place that there's
only one person doing that research or no
[SPEAKER_02]: people doing that research, you probably
might want to be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if there's like five or six people
all doing the same thing, your odds of
[SPEAKER_02]: making a match are much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's only one person, by all means,
reach out to that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, hey, I think your research is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make an application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you taking students at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have funding for new students at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they say, wow, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have a student.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't had a grant in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea how I would fund you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might think, let's not make an
application there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can sort of weight things in your
favor by doing your legwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at who's there, how many
people are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to ask them to make a
commitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to say is, do you think
you'll be likely to take students next
[SPEAKER_02]: year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have funding for a new student at
this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Faculty are busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not get back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's an easy question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most often, they'll say,
yeah, there's a good chance I might be
[SPEAKER_02]: taking someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you sort of put that in your
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say, OK, that's a good school to
apply to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the funding, the fit, and then the
merit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the merit, I mean, the pieces of the
application that relate to merit are your
[SPEAKER_02]: coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: GPA is an important thing in getting into
grad school, but probably not as important
[SPEAKER_02]: as getting into undergrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there's a wide range of GPAs
that we accept into graduate school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And partially, we're not as concerned
about GPA just because you don't spend as
[SPEAKER_02]: much time in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we want to know is, are you going to
be successful in research?
[SPEAKER_02]: The book learning isn't as important
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very interested in what courses
you've taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've taken really easy classes,
if you've sort of not taken important
[SPEAKER_02]: classes that we think are crucial to
getting into grad school in our area,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be more of a problem than
if your GPA was a little bit lower than a
[SPEAKER_02]: 4.0, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are all going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your plant sciences majors got
good core requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing the background that you would
need to get into a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: programs in the sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's probably not going to be an
issue for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do look at GRE scores, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But GRE scores, again, we don't expect
perfect GRE scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the students we admit tend to be
in the top quartile.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people below, not in the top quartile,
can still get accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of a balancing game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a really high GPA,
but your GRE is a little lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two components we look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But neither one of them are sort of
determinative in its own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the letters of recommendation are
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is why, again, you want to
have real world experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you take a course with
somebody, and you're one of 200 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can say, oh, they did really well
on the final.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a really good letter of
recommendation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you do an internship or a
research experience where you're working
[SPEAKER_02]: with that person closely over a whole
semester or maybe multiple semesters,
[SPEAKER_02]: that person's going to be able to write a
much better letter that recommends you for
[SPEAKER_02]: who you are, for your capabilities and
your strengths and your interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting to know professionals is a
good way to be able to get good letters of
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last part of your application
itself is your statement of purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to write a statement when
you get into undergrad, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a little bit more of kind of
like an essay, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: The statement of purpose for grad school,
I like to describe it as more like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: more you telling your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you talking about where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where you're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And filling in the gaps in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to say with a statement of
purpose in going to grad school is you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to convince the admissions
committee that you're really interested
[SPEAKER_02]: and passionate in this area that you're
trying to get a degree in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you're well prepared to be
successful in that endeavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually you want to start off with
where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you learn about this topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys are all interested in plant
sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might say, oh, I got interested in
plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had this really remarkable
experience once that involved a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you guys in plant sciences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have a formative experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this the only thing that CALS would
accept you for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you guys pick plant sciences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a superb way to start that
kind of statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't you be a florist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted more and better things.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: In high school, we had a career day where
professionals and students came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two grad students came in with disease
plants and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do research on plant diseases.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked on problems all my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all greats, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how you sort of start talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your interaction with professionals,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your real world experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things that ground you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say, hey, this is how I got
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next step is, what did you do
with that information?
[SPEAKER_02]: So OK, I applied to one of the best
schools in the world to study plant
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worked with professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did these research experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understood that this is really what
I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to learn about plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I want to learn about agronomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did this internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did this other internship,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're sort of telling your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say, and what I've really
realized is I want to do X.
[SPEAKER_02]: You then sort of project forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say, in 10 years, 15 years,
I want to win the World Food Prize by
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing productivity of something or
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you project forward what you want to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say, to get there,
what I really need is a PhD in plant
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences from your school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're telling that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did you start?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your interest?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that interest grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you develop your skill set?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is the degree at this program that
you're targeting the natural, inevitable
[SPEAKER_02]: next step for you on your trajectory to a
Nobel Prize?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of
Nobel Prizes in the plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so that statement of purpose is
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also important in terms of
telling your own story.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something in your application
package that you're worried about or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that you want to emphasize,
this is your chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really proud of something you
did, you want to fit that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something that was really
important, you want to fit that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something you're really nervous
about, I mean, it's quite common that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you had a real hard time in that
organic chemistry class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you got a D in calculus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe you did badly on the GRE test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to ignore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because somebody's going to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can tell your own story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say, I got a D because it was
really a big adjustment going to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my girlfriend dumped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my grandma died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this bad stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next semester, I turned it around
and got straight A's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I owned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made sure I doubled down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you take this thing that looks
like a weakness, and you turn it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: strength in a story of personal
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the statement of purpose lets you
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, frankly, that's the first
thing I look at when I look at an
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if somebody is passionate and
committed about what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they know who they are, that's usually
pretty obvious as soon as I read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're just adrift, and they don't
know what they want to do, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grad school because they don't
know what else to do, that's obvious too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that statement is something I think
that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those other components are the
statement, the GREs, the coursework,
[SPEAKER_02]: and very much, well, I guess you're the
letters of recommendation, and then that
[SPEAKER_02]: real world experience piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to look for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that will also help you to write that
letter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions about grad school or
applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you brought up what grad school they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are fellowships looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to look and read the description
of what the fellowship is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, and think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would take that fellowship
application to some professional you work
[SPEAKER_02]: with or an advisor and get their opinion
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of those programs are going
to have some kind of coordinator or
[SPEAKER_02]: project manager or program officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would very much touch base with that
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be that those guidelines are
really straightforward and you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any question, or even if you
think it might be helpful, it's OK to
[SPEAKER_02]: contact the person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact the person in charge of that
program and say, hey, this is who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me advice on what you're
looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this suitable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rarely ever would that be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can help to get information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each program has different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are designed for,
maybe they're designed for trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance the number of people doing
international research or people with a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain background.
[SPEAKER_02]: NSF tends to have different focus areas
like biology or chemistry or engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd want to sort of suss that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing you could do, I don't
know, we must have these resources at
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell, certainly for NSF.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can find out who has gotten these
awards in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be able to get some sense
as to how those people have been
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have a few programs that are
aimed to trying to help students get those
[SPEAKER_02]: NSF fellowships, but they're sort of all
over campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure that I could point you
towards one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions about how many
times should I take it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I start taking them?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a poor score, should I take it
again?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take it as many times as you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only score that you really see in the
application is the highest score.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't show you every time you've
taken the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually they show you the highest score.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get a low score and you want to
take it again, there is really no penalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do worse, it's not going to
show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do better, it will, and the bad one
will go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it costs money and time and effort
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't just take it 20 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you can take it when you feel like
you're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a real heavy content-based exam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like the SAT in that
regard, where it doesn't require a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have knowledge in the
plant sciences to do well on that test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, unfortunately, one of these things
where test prep makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting a book and reading about
questions, practice questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to take a course on how to do
it, those things do help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, early and often, potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no downside, I think, to doing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there subject tests?
[SPEAKER_03]: One year?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, they have had some subject
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never get those scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we don't require them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be that some universities did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if they still offer
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have in the past had some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally, they're not required.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your program requires it, you'll
actually see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good reason to look out for
what programs you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there might be a particular
program you want that requires a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular subject test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of programs I'm familiar with,
and particularly in the plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware of anybody who would require
a subject test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the general GRE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've covered most of the things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you have other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what grad school is all about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I didn't talk a whole lot about
what you can do with a graduate degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But preparing for graduate school or
getting admitted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have any suggestions?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you actually do with a PhD
besides be a professor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can be a professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get a PhD if you want to be a
professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what else do you do with a PhD?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do people with PhDs do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody know anybody who's not a professor
at Cornell who has a PhD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does he do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the ones that I know are researchers
at hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mud fuds.
[SPEAKER_02]: MD PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've met those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just PhDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they sort of academic professors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they actually doing... Just
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just research.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's actually, it's sort of
ironic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get a PhD, you can look at the
salaries of PhDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can look at the salaries of,
I'm sorry, MDs and PhDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: PhDs always get less than MDs,
which, you know, we're not disgruntled
[SPEAKER_02]: about that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get an MD and a PhD,
you actually get less money than if you
[SPEAKER_02]: had just an MD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you a sense of how the MDs think
about the PhDs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get the PhD, they're like,
oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody know somebody with a graduate
degree and what they do for a living?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, very much,
you know, sort of a business kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like aerospace stuff?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, I was the first person in my family
to go to grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of my cousins you know,
she actually went to the military and then
[SPEAKER_02]: she got a master's in physics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's working in a hospital now,
working on these giant machines that image
[SPEAKER_02]: your body, you know, sort of basically
repairing them and make sure they work
[SPEAKER_02]: properly, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not aerospace, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so academia is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, boy, you know, I think I had some
statistics on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like 30 to 50% of your PhDs are going
to be academic you know, professors or
[SPEAKER_02]: instructors of some sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 20 to 30% are in the private sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Boeing, one of my PhD students is
working at Bayer Crop Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's working in their sort of
genomic research area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's doing genome analysis of plants
and microbes to try and find things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are valuable for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got other people who came
through my program who are working at
[SPEAKER_02]: biotech startups in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biotechnology kind of industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people get research,
either research administration or sales or
[SPEAKER_02]: technical or data positions or even
writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of PhDs, you know, you get a lot of
writing skill doing a PhD and those
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific writing skills are quite
marketable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 20 to 30% of PhDs are in the
private sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe about five to 10% in government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of scientists in
particularly plant sciences and EPA,
[SPEAKER_02]: USDA, NRC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The National Science Foundation,
USGS, even the Department of Energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these government agencies employ a lot
of scientists, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-governmental organizations as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are international research
organizations or sort of conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations that you can get a job with
with a PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, probably the majority of jobs are
outside of academia, but they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: related to research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they may not even,
you know, you get a PhD in the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the skill set you have,
of course, it's a natural for you to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: job relating to plant sciences or
agriculture or biotechnology, but that
[SPEAKER_02]: skill set translates in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there are jobs and like you
could get jobs probably in the patent
[SPEAKER_02]: office, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got this knowledge, you know,
they need people with knowledge because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're patenting stuff that relates to
plant science all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so somebody with a PhD in the plant
sciences would be marketable there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have that skill set in terms of
research, maybe data analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of big data in plant
sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know how to work with big data,
a lot of the ways you work with data,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's DNA sequence data or census
data or some corporate kind of data,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, those computer skills are going
to translate pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you're going into the graduate
degree in the plant sciences, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably like plant sciences,
you know, but that degree is still
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not necessarily
pigeonholed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of, and that's why the
unemployment rate for PhDs is so darn low.
Good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say yes and no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think where you go, where you go is
probably somewhat less important than who
[SPEAKER_02]: you work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the reason for that is because your
training is going to be very strongly
[SPEAKER_02]: influenced by the program of the person
you're working with, your mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a professional network.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're known for a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good at a certain thing,
and they're going to be training you in
[SPEAKER_02]: that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the world expert in using drones to
measure agronomy and aeronomic variables
[SPEAKER_02]: is at, you know, Humboldt State in
California, not to mean Humboldt State,
[SPEAKER_02]: but say you're at Humboldt State,
you're probably better off going to
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt State if that's your area of
interest, rather than like going to like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvard or Stanford if there's nobody
doing that thing at Harvard or Stanford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, you'd have this fancy
degree, you know, but if you're interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in being a leader in that area,
you want to get trained from a leader in
[SPEAKER_02]: that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And professionals know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, so I'm a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you know, there aren't so many
microbiologists out there that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know the people in my field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know if you came from a
particular area, I know something about
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have certain skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have certain expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's based on the person,
not the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might differ a little bit if you're
interested in industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're working in an area outside of
your focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in the plant sciences and
you're staying in the plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: who you work with, is probably more
important than where you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the further you get away from that
core discipline, so if you're getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: job in a biotech industry where they don't
know anything about plant sciences or you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get a writing job, you know,
they might be more impressed by the place
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than the person, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't say that the place doesn't
matter, but it matters more the further
[SPEAKER_02]: you get away from the focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more you're maintaining that
focus, probably the less the place matters
[SPEAKER_02]: and more the person matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's again where, as a student,
you don't always know who the best people
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with are, but that's why you want
to develop a network while you're here at
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the people who you're going to be
working with, your advisors and the
[SPEAKER_02]: graduate students and the postdocs,
they'll have a sense and they'll be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell you, oh, if you're interested in
this, you probably want to work with one
[SPEAKER_02]: of these three or four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, my wife has a PhD in
information sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she runs a very small information
technology company, basically her and my
[SPEAKER_03]: son.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do websites as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, starting your own companies,
that's another thing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to work in academia,
but you want to make your own job,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want to be your own entrepreneur,
having that PhD actually gives you a level
[SPEAKER_03]: of credibility than the other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're able to, you know,
you've got a director level position.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can identify a research project and
then lead that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether that's in academia or starting
a company, it's the same skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in a lot of senses, you know,
being a faculty member is kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: running a startup, you know, because all
of your funding comes externally and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like capital investment,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically always drumming up
capital to do your research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of relationship between
starting up a small company and being an
[SPEAKER_02]: academic, so oddly enough, in the sciences
at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think I've covered everything I
wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's probably a million questions
we could answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to tell people, you know,
if you want to take, it depends on what
[SPEAKER_02]: you do at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best case scenario if you're taking
time off is you're doing something that
[SPEAKER_02]: relates to your area of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, and it might actually be
strategically important for you to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best case is let's say you came in
as a transfer student and let's say you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have a lot of opportunities to do
research while you were here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you remember, you know, Dan Buckley at
this talk told me that I should have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of research experience before I go to grad
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, with your undergraduate
degree, you can probably get a job as a
[SPEAKER_02]: technician either in a company or maybe in
a research lab somewhere on campus,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you work for a year or two doing
research in the plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: something related to, it doesn't have to
be exactly the same, but something close
[SPEAKER_02]: to what you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you apply for grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually going to be much stronger,
you know, with those two years break than
[SPEAKER_02]: you would have been right out of undergrad
because now you're coming with this
[SPEAKER_02]: background, the skill set, another good
letter of recommendation and probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger statement of purpose because you
know better who you are and what you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to the degree that you take a gap year
or years and you're doing something
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant and that's part of your story,
part of your arc, you know, to get you
[SPEAKER_02]: where you want to go, then it's a great
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's totally unrelated, then it's not
as good of an idea, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer you're out of grad school doing
something that's not relevant to this
[SPEAKER_02]: goal, you know, people are going to be
like, well, what were you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're really interested in
going to grad school for X, why did you
[SPEAKER_02]: spend five years doing something totally
different?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, and maybe you have a
good reason for that, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_02]: justify it, but it's going to raise some
question marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to be like, well,
why did you, you know, go mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: climbing in the Andes for five years when
what you really want to do is molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: biology in the lab, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you're mountain climbing in the
Andes because you're trying to find a rare
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that you want to study, you know,
the molecular biology of, then it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just have to think about how that
fits into your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
