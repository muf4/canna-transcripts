[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Mingyi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today I'm going to talk to you about
vineyard underlying soil management.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to look at it from two
perspectives, including a vine physiology
[SPEAKER_08]: co-perspective, as well as vineyard soil
microbial, grape microbial, and wine
[SPEAKER_08]: fermentation microbial perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at a picture, you will
notice that bear soil under vine for a
[SPEAKER_08]: closer picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maintaining bear soil under vine is the
most popular vineyard management practice
[SPEAKER_08]: in our region.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason for that is we basically
heritage this from the juice grape
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, where they needed a larger vine
to support higher yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for wine grape industry, excessive
vigor is a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are just sending their crews to do
hedging multiple times, to do leaf pulling
[SPEAKER_08]: multiple times, just to control the vine
vigor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know that this is not a very
favorable kind of management practice in
[SPEAKER_08]: our wine grape industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And plus, there is a research done by our
group by Mr. Adam Carroll, who is not here
[SPEAKER_08]: today, who found that using glyphosate to
maintain bear soil under vine in vineyard
[SPEAKER_08]: for long term, you increase the amount of
a nutrient leaching and also the pesticide
[SPEAKER_08]: leaching and the soil leachate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So overall speaking, this is not really
suitable for a lot of the wine grape
[SPEAKER_08]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are looking for a good alternative.
[SPEAKER_08]: So many people study that using under vine
cover crops as an alternative.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they found that under vine cover crop
can reduce vine vigor through water and
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrient competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those studies were done in young
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened in a mature vineyard with
those vines with well established fruit
[SPEAKER_08]: system?
[SPEAKER_08]: So study done by our group again.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a mature recently vineyard,
we found that under vine cover crop did
[SPEAKER_08]: not impact on vine growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did not impact on vine water, nutrient
status, and did not impact on berry
[SPEAKER_08]: composition.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we found is that wine sensory
properties were impacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that really make us think,
because if we don't get the effect from
[SPEAKER_08]: the physiological perspective,
what else can playing the trick there?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we start getting curious about the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe microbes is playing the trick
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to study more to focus on the
microbial perspective in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are our objectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to evaluate how under vine cover
crops would affect on the vegetative
[SPEAKER_08]: growth, yield, fruit composition of a
mature recently vineyard, and finger legs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to determine how soil health
will be impacted by adopting different
[SPEAKER_08]: under vine flow and flora management
practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are considered as the
physiological perspectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we also want to know the microbial
perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to see how flora management
practice would affect soil, grape,
[SPEAKER_08]: and also wine fermenting microbial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, we want to evaluate the
sensory property of the wine to see if the
[SPEAKER_08]: wine sensory property are being affected
If so, is this going through a physiology
[SPEAKER_08]: route or is it going through a microbial
route?
[SPEAKER_08]: So our experimenter was contacted at Ovid,
New York, sitting on the Howard Gravely
[SPEAKER_08]: Loam with long-term average growth degree
days around 1,376 based on degree Celsius.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the vineyard was conventionally
managed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The vines are mature vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2014, they're around 14 to
15-year-old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the vines were Scott Henry trained to
16 buds per meter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are the treatments we use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So GLY means glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we sprayed glyphosate one to two times
per season depending on the weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also consider this as our control.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other two treatments, our natural
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we abbreviate that as NV, which are
basically just lead to weeds to grow under
[SPEAKER_08]: vines.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we mow them down whenever it's
interfering the fruiting zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And CULT, which means soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did it by using rototiller and hemp
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the whole experimental setup,
we adopt randomized complete block design
[SPEAKER_08]: with each of the treatment replicate for
four times.
[SPEAKER_08]: For each of our experimental unit,
it contains nine panels in three rows,
[SPEAKER_08]: as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: For each of the panel contains three
vines.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's nine panels.
[SPEAKER_08]: We only collect our sample from the middle
panel, which is our data panel,
[SPEAKER_08]: because we're doing microbial work here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really want to have that physical
and spatial barrier to prevent the
[SPEAKER_08]: interference coming from outside of our
experimental unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we set up like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to be big enough to have those buffer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at the results first,
the physiological results.
[SPEAKER_08]: So vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We measured primary shoot growth and
lateral shoot growth throughout the
growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we measured the growth in the growing
season for each of the year, for 2015 and
[SPEAKER_08]: 16.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just remind you that the experiment was
set up in 2014, but we only collected
[SPEAKER_08]: yield and grape data in 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the growth, like vegetative growth,
we only collected data in 2015 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was assessed in these two years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the vegetative growth, we use primary
and lateral shoot growth as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you can see here, for lateral shoot
growth, we measured shoot length and also
[SPEAKER_08]: the proportion of shoot that had lateral
shoot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, we did not see any
difference among the treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to remind you that at our site,
the vines are huge and they're mature.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have that really extensive,
really well-established root system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they get assessed to those really deep
soil, water, and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is very reasonable to not see any
difference among the treatment here in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of the vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we use mid-day stem water potential as
an indicator for the vine water status.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's measured as farce.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did not see any difference among
the treatment in 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the late season 2015, I found that
natural vegetation and cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: basically devising those two treatments
had a higher stem water potential compared
[SPEAKER_08]: to that of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the theory behind that is for those two
treatments, they basically have soil
[SPEAKER_08]: surface protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in native vegetation, in 2015,
around August, we had very low rainfall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a lot of the weeds were stung
growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the bits just hang out there,
but they're not doing like a very
[SPEAKER_08]: aggressive growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for cultivation, after we do the
cultivation, the plant procedures are just
[SPEAKER_08]: left on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those stuff just serve as a surface
cover, like a mulch.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they protect the surface soil water to
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means for those vines that got
more of the surface soil water.
[SPEAKER_08]: For vine nutrient status, we took leaf
patios at verazum for each of the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not see any difference among
treatment in 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in 2015, we found that natural
vegetation basically increased the amount
[SPEAKER_08]: of the alumnum in the patios compared to
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my theory behind this is, if you input
a lot of the organic matters, and if
[SPEAKER_08]: there's weeds actively growing in your
soil, that means in a very small scale
[SPEAKER_08]: localized soil, there would be soil
acidification.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that freed up a lot of the free
alumnum to the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we see this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the theory that I formed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for natural vegetation, that also
reduces the amount of magnums in the vine
[SPEAKER_08]: by 28% compared to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this can just purely due to the
competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also collect the vine yield and
pruning weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So vine yield, it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just how much of the fruits for each
vine we got.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we measure the amount of fruits for
each vine, and we weigh it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we measured the reproductive
growth for the vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And pruning weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to explain you pruning
weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in each of the growing season,
after we harvest and after the leaf fall,
[SPEAKER_08]: we prune the vine into the same shape with
same numbers of shoots and same number of
[SPEAKER_08]: buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just maintain it into the same shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those shoots got pruned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pruned off, we consider as the shoots of
the concurrent year growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we weigh those shoots as our pruning
weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can see here, those are the
shoots that prune off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this guy's having that backpack
weighing scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just weigh the amount of shoots we
prune from the vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is the indicator for the
vegetative growth for each of the vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we got the yield from the vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the vegetative growth of the vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we get an idea of the balance between
those reproductive growth and vegetative
[SPEAKER_08]: growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, in our study, we found no
difference among the yield, pruning
[SPEAKER_08]: weight, and also the ratio between them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is no difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, because our vines are huge,
and they have very deep roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they have those resources coming
really deep down from the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is reasonable to not see those
differences in the mature vineyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it basically confirms our previous
study.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we also measured the grape basic
composition parameters, such as bricks,
[SPEAKER_08]: pH, and total acidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in general, we do not see any
difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in 2015, the grapevine cultivation
treatments had a lower acidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look more closely into the bricks
for 2015 cultivation here, you'll find
[SPEAKER_08]: that the number is really weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in a normal maturation process,
usually, the sugar content is coupled with
[SPEAKER_08]: a lower amount of acidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you get higher sugar, you get
lower acidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this treatment, we found that the
grapes from the cultivation in 2015
[SPEAKER_08]: actually had a lower sugar and also lower
acidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we found is that in 2015,
we had some vines in that treatment
[SPEAKER_08]: specifically had the liberal virus
infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why the decouple of sugar and
acids happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in 2016, a lot of those vines were
naturally dead or those vines that show
[SPEAKER_08]: the really severe symptoms, which is
excluded from our experiment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2016, we see that the number come
back to normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, we did not see any
difference among the treatments for those
[SPEAKER_08]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we assessed sensory properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of you are very excited about
this data because a lot of you have
[SPEAKER_08]: contributed to this and got the money out
of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the most important thing is,
do you remember those days when you opened
[SPEAKER_08]: your email inbox and see 10 emails from
me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Asking you to do my sensory study.
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you remember that time when you see
me in a hallway, just sweaty and grumpy,
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to get people's stuff in the room
to smell my stinky wine?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that you're freaked out because I
look like a drug dealer or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guarantee you, it's not going to
happen again because we got all the data
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, Annie is going to do
that in the near future.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at data.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to explain to you how we did
this for those of you who didn't come to
[SPEAKER_08]: my sensory study.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we basically asked all the panelists to
smell through all the wines and then sort
[SPEAKER_08]: the wine into groups based on their aroma
similarity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the wines that smells the same to the
panelists, they just put it into the same
[SPEAKER_08]: group.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we assign the score based on the
grouping.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we collect all the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we calculate the distant matrix
between or among the samples.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we visualize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we visualize it based on the distant
matrix.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know it sounds very confusing and
sounds very complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you need to know is that if the
samples are closer together, that means
[SPEAKER_08]: their aroma similarity will higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the samples are further apart,
that means their aroma similarity are
[SPEAKER_08]: lower.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can see in 2014, glyphosate
samples clustered together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means there may be a treatment
effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's look at 2015-16.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2015, now we see the causing of
cultivation but not glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2016, we don't see any.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clustering or pattern at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So which means we don't, like overall
speaking, we don't see the treatment
[SPEAKER_08]: effects in each year of the wine sensory
properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: So also measure the soil health parameters
including aggregate stability,
[SPEAKER_08]: organic matter content, microbial
respiration rate, and carbon
[SPEAKER_08]: mineralizability.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here, in the third year of study in
2016, we basically see the increase of
[SPEAKER_08]: aggregate stability and organic matter for
the natural vegetation treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is very easy to understand because
if you just let a weed to grow,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's organic matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And during the winter, they got killed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just a natural input of organic
matter into the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have a higher organic matter
content, then you are expecting a better
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial activity and also a better
aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's easy to understand here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2015, we also see an increase in
microbial respiration rate in the natural
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetation and also 2016 compared to the
rest of the treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so microbial respiration is an
indicator for the microbial activity in
[SPEAKER_08]: soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is important because if a higher
microbial activity, that means you will
[SPEAKER_08]: have a higher nutrient mineralization in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's beneficial to both your plants
and the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we see that natural vegetation increase
the microbial activity there in both
[SPEAKER_08]: years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the carbon mineralizability,
it's an indicator for the nutrient
[SPEAKER_08]: mineralization in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found that natural vegetation
increased the mineralizability,
[SPEAKER_08]: carbon mineralizability in 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: So overall speaking, our soil health was
improved throughout 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to summarize the physiological
perspective, vine vegetative growth,
[SPEAKER_08]: fruit composition, basic fruit composition
parameters, and wine sensory properties
[SPEAKER_08]: were not impacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no difference among the
treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, natural vegetation treatments
basically improve the soil health.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at let's look at the result
from our microbial study.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we sample the soil and the grapes in
the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: We grid sample six soil cores and 10
clusters from each of the experimental
[SPEAKER_08]: units.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we combine all the sub samples
for each of the experimental unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we extract the DNA out of it
using those DNA isolation kits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are also interested to see the wine
fermentation microbiome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here I want to explain it very clear
that we only want to capture the effect of
[SPEAKER_08]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to get rid of those great
composition variation from different
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we did was we obtained a Cornell
juice from Lansing that's a Riesling
[SPEAKER_08]: juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we pasteurized it So that's not
coming from our experimental site,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's just a base juice that we use and
we pasteurize it will kill all the
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we use that the base juice to rinse 24
clusters from each of the treatment at our
[SPEAKER_08]: experimental site.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means we use so that means we
dislodge those microbes on the surface of
[SPEAKER_08]: the grace from each of the treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we use that to do our
fermentation to inoculate the base juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So finally, during our fermentation,
the only difference amount, the different
[SPEAKER_08]: batch of the wine, the only difference
there is the microbiome difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the difference is coming from the
treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really exclude that confounding
factors of the very composition difference
[SPEAKER_08]: among the treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we took samples through all the
fermentation and the sample DNAs,
[SPEAKER_08]: then sequence used Illumina Myseq.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for bacterias, we target 16S region
and for fungi, we target IDS regions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the results.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I get into result, I want to talk
to you about the methods we use.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see here, it says PicoA on the
axis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which represents principal coordinates
analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we did is we extract a matrix
number from each of the sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that takes organism, relative
abundance, diversity, and the present and
[SPEAKER_08]: absence of those organisms into account
for each of the sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then among all those samples,
there's a huge variation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we extract two dimensions that explain
the most variance among the sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we use those as our two axes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we plot the samples according to
those two axes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is very complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of you are falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just keep in mind that if you see the
samples are further apart, that means
[SPEAKER_08]: their microbial community structure are
less similarity.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're close together, that means
they're more similar to each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the soil bacterial community
structure data for 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, we can see a pattern here that
green dots, which is the natural
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetation on top of here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the cultivation samples are here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They separate according to the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2014, they just run in together.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to find a pattern here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in 2016, we basically see that the
blue dots, the blue samples, and the green
[SPEAKER_08]: samples, they separated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are visual results.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the visual results were validated with
a paired prima nova analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a number to actually show that
your visual conception is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see that natural vegetation treatment,
the soil composition was very different
[SPEAKER_08]: from cultivation glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2015, there's no pattern, as you
remember in the PicoA analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no difference among the treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in 2016, that natural vegetation,
the green dots, was very different from
[SPEAKER_08]: the glyphosate, which was the blue dots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the overall analysis also showed that
natural vegetation really made the
[SPEAKER_08]: bacterial community structure very
different from that of glyphosate and
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And soil fungal community also analyzed
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are two patterns you can find in
the visual results here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, the round dots,
those round dots are here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the square dots are here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the diamond dots are in the middle
of the graph.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they basically cluster based on our
x-axis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the shape represents years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, our sample cluster based on
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Year to year difference is important here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, you see there's a color
clustering as well, because all the green
[SPEAKER_08]: dots, no matter if it's dark green or
light green, they basically separated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see that natural vegetation had a
huge impact on the microbial community,
[SPEAKER_08]: on the fungal community structure here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, this is validated by our paired
prima nova analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, in 2015, 2016,
and the overall analysis showed that each
[SPEAKER_08]: of the soil fungal community structure of
each of the treatment being distinctive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to remind you why we want to do
this analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we look into the soil,
and then we look into the grapes and wine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because many of you have noticed that
microbiome in the wine world has been a
[SPEAKER_08]: really hot topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of good papers coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all focus on one issue,
that is microbial terroir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microbial terroir is a very vague term.
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, they claim that microbes in
the vineyard or microbes in the wine,
[SPEAKER_08]: they give the wine a sense of location.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to really look into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are two leaders in the United
States, they did a lot of research on this
[SPEAKER_08]: topic, including Jack Gilberts,
who came last year to give a talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Gilberts from University of Chicago,
and Dave Mills from UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for Gilberts group, they found that for
vine aerial organ associate microbes,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're actually originated from the
vineyard soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's on the aerial parts,
including grapes, is originated from the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil in the vineyard soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they only did a bacterial community
study.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want you to look into the fungi to
see if that's true for fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know that it's very different
for fungi and bacteria, and the spore
[SPEAKER_08]: size.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mobility is very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to see if that's true for fungal
community as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for Dave Mills group, they found a
strong association among vineyard site,
[SPEAKER_08]: climate, and also the wine fermenting
microbial.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to study that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so later, I will show you our wine
data.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we sampled from soil grapes
to the wine fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at the grape data.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that there's a very clear
pattern.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cluster based on shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you look into each of the cluster,
there's no separation based on the color.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they cluster based on year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So year is important factor here,
but not color treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So treatment is not an important factor
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that doesn't trigger the separation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this data, the visual data is being
supported by paired per manova analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that there's no significance
among the treatments for all three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means, yes, adopting different under
vine soil management practice really had a
[SPEAKER_08]: great impact on the soil microbial
community.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this does not reflect on what's on the
grapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very different from the previous
studies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we take samples throughout the wine
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are in 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is where we took the sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: So day seven and day nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So day nine is the very beginning of the
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, it's when the sugar start
dropping.
[SPEAKER_08]: And day 13, which is a back slope,
is that the peak of fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Day 21 is a late stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And day 48, that is at the end of
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we took the samples throughout the
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to compare the treatments
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ni not inoculated means it's just a
fermentation control to see if the
[SPEAKER_08]: fermentation went wrong or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we want to compare is among these
treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is non-metric multidimensional
sorting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a different method than the P COA.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the way to interpret the data is the
same.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you see the points are close,
that means the microbial community are
[SPEAKER_08]: more similar and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you see here, it's a very,
very clear clustering pattern that the
[SPEAKER_08]: sample cluster base based on the day of
fermentation or the stage of fermentation,
[SPEAKER_08]: but not by treatment here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we see here is that the soil
microbial community was heavily impacted
[SPEAKER_08]: by using different soil measurement
practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this does not reflect on the
grapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nothing was bringing over into the wine
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another interesting thing that we found is
is this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Saccharomyces is always being
considered as the major player during the
[SPEAKER_08]: wine fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: What it means is during the wine
fermentation or at least at the peak of
[SPEAKER_08]: the fermentation, the Saccharomyces will
present the most in the relative abundance
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's a major player is doing the
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the numbers of the Saccharomyces being
the largest during the fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, in our fermentation, what we
found is that Hansenia spora presented
[SPEAKER_08]: most in relative abundance throughout the
fermentation and even at the peak of the
[SPEAKER_08]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at the peak of
fermentation, which is day 13,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's around 60% relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas the Saccharomyces is only at 15%
of relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's very different from what we
normally think and from most of the
[SPEAKER_08]: previous study.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we don't know what the actual
function for the Hansenia spora is there
[SPEAKER_08]: in the wine fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just show you this very interesting
results.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so finally, the wine sensory study
for the seed simulated spontaneous
[SPEAKER_08]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the results.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very random scatter of the samples
on the two dimensional plot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically we did not see any patterns
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is very reason because we see no
difference of microbial communities on the
[SPEAKER_08]: grapes among the treatments and also there
is no difference amount of treatments in
[SPEAKER_08]: the wine so that the sensory properties
would not impact it as very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that's basically our microbial
study.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to summarize it, we found that vintage
being the major role there in terms of the
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial community structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: For soils and grapes and natural
vegetation impacted soil microbial
[SPEAKER_08]: community structure in terms of the
bacteria and also the fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And fermentation stage was the only factor
there to trigger the sample clustering on
[SPEAKER_08]: the two dimensional sorting, but not the
treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the overall wine sensory properties
would not impact it by our underlying soil
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in conclusion for the whole study,
the underlying soil management did not
[SPEAKER_08]: impact on vine growth yield or the simple
berry composition parameters of the
[SPEAKER_08]: matured we've seen vine and finger legs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And natural vegetation generally improve
the soil health as you can see that the
[SPEAKER_08]: parameter we use soil aggregation,
organic matter, microbial respiration rate
[SPEAKER_08]: and cover mineralizability were all
improved by using a natural vegetation.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of microbial community that under
my soil management impact on the soil
[SPEAKER_08]: bacterial and fungal community,
but that effect did not reflect on what's
[SPEAKER_08]: on the grape and what's in the wine
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So overall speaking, there are no
detection on the wine sensory properties,
[SPEAKER_08]: no matter is through the conventional
winemaking or is through simulated
[SPEAKER_08]: spontaneous fermentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my study and there's so many
people I want to thank through my study
[SPEAKER_08]: here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So firstly, I want to thank Kishore Point
Winery because they provide me the link
[SPEAKER_08]: and to use and to do the research and they
do everything they could to support us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank Steve Lurch,
our field technician and assistant and the
[SPEAKER_08]: people at Geneva Brewing and Winemaking
Lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also my previous and my current lab
mate, like Adam Carroll is standing right
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also my committee member, Anna
Catherine Mansfield, Jenny Coniffen,
[SPEAKER_08]: Johannes Lehmann.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most important of all, my major
advisor, Justin Venehue, who not only
[SPEAKER_08]: helped me through my research and also
make me a much better person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm willing to take questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start from Geneva and I will just...
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wondering if you can describe what
your natural vegetation treatments look
[SPEAKER_09]: like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Were the weeds three feet tall,
six feet tall?
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there any attempt to control or mow
the weeds that were growing in this
[SPEAKER_09]: treatment?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 2014, because there is some,
you know, the herbicide residues in the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the weeds were not growing so well.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they got like around 80
centimeter to a meter tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't have to mow them down in
2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in 2015, they got really tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to mow them down like twice in
the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like maximum that for what I can
remember, they can get to around my same
[SPEAKER_08]: height as me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, you can get really tall for
those, especially milkweeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw a lot of milkweeds that get really
tall in 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2016, they're not that aggressive,
but we had to mow them down once in the
[SPEAKER_08]: very late season.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mingyi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice seminar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we go for Genevappers?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So please.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really enjoyed your talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed in many of your analyses,
years seemed very different.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might find a significant result in
2015, or the first year, but not the
[SPEAKER_10]: second.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you attribute that kind of
variation to?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was a drier year, but is there
other confounding factors or how do you
[SPEAKER_10]: make sense out of the big year differences
you saw?
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will consider climate being the most
important factor there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a lot more than just climate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at different treatments,
the weeds growing is really different
[SPEAKER_08]: among the year because of the climate,
and also because of the disease pressure
[SPEAKER_08]: that different from year to year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the spraying program are very
different, and the way the vineyard crew
[SPEAKER_08]: managed the vineyard were different.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say the most important factor
there is because of the climate that
[SPEAKER_08]: triggers the different weed pressure,
different disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that results in a very different data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to know, to what extent
do you think there's any motivation then
[SPEAKER_05]: for mature vineyard managers with mature
vineyards to work towards improving soil
[SPEAKER_05]: health?
[SPEAKER_05]: You did say at the beginning, maybe less
leaching of nutrients and pesticides,
[SPEAKER_05]: but to what extent are they fertilizing
and safe on losses?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what about soil compaction?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that matter to them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just kind of try to get a read of how
our vineyard manager is going to respond
[SPEAKER_05]: to this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do I have to repeat?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the question is, what's the
incentive for the growers to use different
[SPEAKER_08]: soil management practice?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because basically, we see no difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in yield or sensory quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in inputs or environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we think of another way around it,
if there is no impact on the yield or the
[SPEAKER_08]: sensory property, why not doing something
that is better for your soil?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you adopt a natural vegetation and
you're improving your soil health that
[SPEAKER_08]: gives your cell more resilience to biotic
or abiotic stress, then it's a good thing
[SPEAKER_08]: for your cell and for the long-term
sustainability in terms of farming.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, the financial sustainability and
also the environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no matter what you do, you're not
impacting on yield and also not impacting
[SPEAKER_08]: on the sensory property.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there would be no short-term
turnover for doing those kind of practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you look at it in the long
run, it is a good thing for not protecting
[SPEAKER_08]: your soil, also protecting a clean water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if the nutrients and pesticide
leach into a waterway, that will get into
[SPEAKER_08]: our drinking water or into the lakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not good for those perspectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned the term microbial terroir.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it seems like from your data,
you disprove that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering, is it worth going into
that anymore?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you kind of feel like it's been
explored enough and it's really just
[SPEAKER_06]: something that sounds nice but doesn't
exist?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the thing is, I'm just testing in our
region.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is, I will say, it's very
region-specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a previous study has shown that
vineyard and climate is playing a major
[SPEAKER_08]: factor there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we proved that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in our region specifically,
what are the obstacles there preventing
[SPEAKER_08]: the microbial terroir to happen is that we
have a really, really big vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our vines are huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the spatial barrier from the soil to
the grape is really far away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even though we have a change in the
microbial community in the soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: it is very hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, it's very hard to get into
the fruiting zone compared to,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's say, in France, in Belgium,
in Champagne, their vines are maybe 30,
[SPEAKER_08]: 40, 50 centimeter tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So their cluster are just hanging next to
the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there have been studies showing that
the mobility of the microbes in the soil
[SPEAKER_08]: to the air, for fungi especially,
is around 15 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really difficult for us,
for the fungi in the soil, to move a meter
[SPEAKER_08]: or a meter 20 centimeter tall to our
fruiting zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that really prevents those to show up
in our study.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, as I mentioned, that we had a
very high disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to spray so many times in a
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even there's something getting to the
fruiting zone, it was very hard for them
[SPEAKER_08]: to either thrive or to be able to be alive
in the grapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for us to capture it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will say, in our specific region
here, it is difficult to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's those reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it cannot be applied to everywhere in
this world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a region from region
difference is contributing to that
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial to our thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is the idea then that the microbes,
they get on the outside of the grape as a
[SPEAKER_07]: result of the dust, the field
manipulations, the wind?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you have mentioned most of the
reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, like the rain splash,
there's a study being shown that the rain
[SPEAKER_08]: splash is playing a role there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, the wind is playing a role
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, like human as a vector to
distribute is also very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your study is really not about
microbiome terroir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you could just define it so that
people, you talked about David Mills and
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Gilbert, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So David Mills is really the most,
more like microbiome terroir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could just explain to people
what it is, I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduates that might be confused.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so microbial terroir is, so let's
define terroir first.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I try not to be too vague.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terroir is basically the sense of the
place in the wine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we call terroir.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you expect even the same grapes with
the same winemaking techniques.
[SPEAKER_08]: People would expect it differently if you
get a California Pinot Noir or a Finger
[SPEAKER_08]: Lake Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that gives you a sense of place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the turn of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what microbial terroir means.
[SPEAKER_08]: And microbial terroir is that what role
does microbes play to give you that sense
[SPEAKER_08]: of place?
[SPEAKER_08]: So microbial terroir is basically that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering, did you look at all,
you talked about spraying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume it was the same for all of your
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you look at that as an interaction
term, like by year?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious if you factored that
in, or thought that could be a compounding
[SPEAKER_04]: factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have the spraying schedule and
what kind of substances they use.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the harvest, so a lot of data were
analyzed at harvest, or the sample were
[SPEAKER_08]: taken at harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before harvest, it's basically there's
about a week of window without spraying.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wouldn't say there would be so much
of an interaction for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were saying that the microbes
travel via air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not going through the root system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that another?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so her question is, does the
microbes only travel through the air?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it not travel through the plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is, yes, it does travel
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of especially bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of them in the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that triggers the plant, or the vine
and grapes, secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, there's a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's important for our next
step to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we see that it's not impacting the
wine sensory properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is there to trigger the wine
sensory differences in the very first
[SPEAKER_08]: study I showed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can really look into those
endophytes to see if they are playing the
[SPEAKER_08]: trick here to really make the wine sensory
properties different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
