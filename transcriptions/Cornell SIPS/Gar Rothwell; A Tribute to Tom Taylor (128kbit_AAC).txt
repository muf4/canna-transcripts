[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is my sad pleasure to talk on the
late Tom Taylor, one of the preeminent
[SPEAKER_02]: paleobotanists of our time, and to kind of
celebrate Tom and Tom's contributions to
[SPEAKER_02]: the discipline over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you who have been in the field
for a little while, like Fran,
[SPEAKER_02]: will know all of the history of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But students coming in, I think it's
helpful for students to see what people
[SPEAKER_02]: can do, what people can become,
and what kind of contributions people can
[SPEAKER_02]: make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know of a better example
for any of us than Tom Taylor to emulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can aspire to the success and
contributions of Tom Taylor, and fail by
[SPEAKER_02]: getting 20% of it done, you will be a
roaring success in the discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is to Tom, who died on the April
28th at the age of 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as a bit of a background,
Tom Taylor is an Ohio boy who went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Miami University, graduating in 1960.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he went on to the University of
Illinois to work with Wilson Stewart.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, the vast majority of
paleobotany that was being practiced was
[SPEAKER_02]: cobalt paleobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tropical wetlands of primarily
Pennsylvanian age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wilson Stewart was one of the leading,
ran one of the leading labs in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Tom, this is Tom, this is his
high school graduation picture,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can see what he looked like at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He then went, after completing his PhD,
he went on to Yale University and worked
[SPEAKER_02]: with Ted Delavorius, who became a lifelong
friend and confidant of Tom's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And immediately after finishing his
postdoc, he was hired at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Illinois at Chicago Circle, where he
arrived in 1965 as an assistant professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was promoted to full professor before
leaving in 1972.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took his first graduate students in
1967, when the graduate program opened up
[SPEAKER_02]: at the University of Illinois at Chicago
Circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in 1972, he went to Ohio University,
was there for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he went on to Ohio State
University to chair the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Botany there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 21 years there, he retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he retired from Ohio State
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he accepted an endowed chair at the
University of Kansas, where he went as
[SPEAKER_02]: chair of the department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where he has been active ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had some significant visiting
professorships, working with Ted
[SPEAKER_02]: Delavorius in 1978, setting up the
international organization, the Paleo
[SPEAKER_02]: Botany Conference that was at the
University of Alberta in 1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then moving on to Munster,
where he became heavily involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: Riney Chert, and particularly the fungal
biotas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Associated with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Tom with his mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom was more than a paleo botanist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was a guy that a lot of us thought
very highly of.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two kinds of slides here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones on the black background
that I've made up in the last two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are these that are very
artsy that Ruth did for a program two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here she celebrates his mentor,
Wilson Stewart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some early field work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will be a coal mine in southern
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Wilson Stewart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one of the same era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Don Agert, who Tom worked with very
closely for many years, and Dave Dilcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Tom's career is a fantastic example
of research productivity, research
[SPEAKER_02]: breadth, research innovation, and rigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very high standards of quality in his
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: He published 468 peer-reviewed papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a goal, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on your way, Kelly?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in peer-reviewed journals and edited
volumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He published three editions of his very
famous and popular Paleo Botany textbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the last edition of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He published the first Paleo Mycology
textbook, which just came out in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: few months here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to follow the progression of Tom 's
research, we see that he began working on
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology and anatomy of cobalt plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a graduate student, he then was very
interested in little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He became very enamored of and worked on
pollen and spores, which brought him to
[SPEAKER_02]: electron microscopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought the first scanning electron
microscope in the city of Chicago into the
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had it in the lab there when
medical schools had to come and use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he developed scanning electron
microscopy techniques that are used in
[SPEAKER_02]: Paleo Botany today.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also used transmission electron
microscopy, and some of his students were
[SPEAKER_02]: trained in that realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, he became interested in fossil
fungi, which we knew very little about,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was very reasonable, because Paleo
Botanists were vascular plant people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fungi you find in anatomical sections
and preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paleo Botanists always want to have
the nicest anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the fungi you find in the
crappiest anatomy, because they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although their fungi were extremely
abundant, we didn't look at them because
[SPEAKER_02]: we didn't know what to look for until Tom
got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That brought him into organismal
interactions through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his last major conquest was Antarctic
Paleo Botany, working on Permian,
[SPEAKER_02]: Triassic, and Jurassic biotas,
some anatomically preserved from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Church and some compression fossils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some early in-the-field shots,
collecting cobalt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Sahara number 6 mine in southern
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a shovel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the size of a three-story
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are like little ants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shovel's actually about 100 yards
beyond where we are collecting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we collected them in the pits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom worked on the genus Pachytesta,
the medullocens, for his doctoral
[SPEAKER_02]: dissertation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after collecting these things and
bagging them up, we would fill up U-holes
[SPEAKER_02]: and haul trucks with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd be extremely tired at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just kill ourselves doing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there were, I think, 6,000 cobalts
that were cut, cataloged, and the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: identified and cross-referenced at the
University of Illinois, Chicago Circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom was an outstanding mentor of students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to scholarship,
we have mentorship.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took his first master's students in
1967.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a list of the people who had
master's degrees with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He turned out doctoral students from 1975
right on up to 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see a large number of names of
people here you know and people who have
[SPEAKER_02]: gone on to be productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: productive scholars in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some pictures that Ruth put
together for his 75th birthday celebration
[SPEAKER_02]: of the former students.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be able to go through all
of these of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is going to go up on the web so
anybody who's interested can actually read
[SPEAKER_02]: all the names here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll point out a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are early graduate students.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim Mickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Ruth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Edie.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Mike Malay down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, of course, Tom working hard
in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: His teaching went on all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a field trip to Arkansas
working on Mississippian stuff with Don
[SPEAKER_02]: Egerton and his compatriot of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tongue out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Sheila Brack here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here he is teaching in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are more students from his Ohio State
days with Kathleen Pig, Charlie Good,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Stubblefield, who did a lot of the
early mycology work with Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Ruth again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is Mike Chin, who was tragically
killed in an air crash coming back from
[SPEAKER_02]: the meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the plane that crashed in Detroit
in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: More students.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck Dolland with Ruth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't name them all because of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will point out one person here,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Michael Krings, the only picture I
have of any of his German connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's Michael, who he's worked with
very extensively in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mentorship continued on to post-docs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom had a few post-docs during his time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to talk about any of
them individually, but I will point out
[SPEAKER_02]: that the post-docs extend from 1975 to
2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: From around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: A large number of very productive scholars
today are on this list.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had very wide collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to scholarship and
mentorship, collaboration with colleagues
[SPEAKER_02]: is something that he did very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are a list of not all of his
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the visiting scientists that he
hosted in his lab over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these include our colleagues from
around the world and many very prominent
[SPEAKER_02]: names as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, along the way, he built a lot of
really strong friendships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ted Delavorius has been a very close
friend of his over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Mike Bolter from England.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Barry Thomas from Wales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Bill Challener from England.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early 1980s, Tom began to work with
Argentine paleobotanists.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Sergio Archangelski, Papa,
the patriarch of paleobotany in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he began working with Sergio and his
students, which has brought together a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifelong collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And little kids like this came into it
along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Tom on a collecting trip,
back of a truck in Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Argentinians know how to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Ruben Cunio, who was here last
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's Nacho Escapa, who spent a year
here a couple years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six months?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six months here a couple years ago,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an assado that we had when I was
out in the field with them four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an early one from 1985.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is Papa.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Edie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the other people in that
photo.
I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you would.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tom went back and forth between first
Ohio State and then from Kansas to
[SPEAKER_02]: Argentina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he is in the petrified forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually started on work from this when
he put Ruth Stock on her master's and
[SPEAKER_02]: doctoral dissertation on cones from the
petrified forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have time to tell you about
her never being there, because she got
[SPEAKER_02]: deported from Argentina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the German
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm afraid I don't have pictures of
the German collaborators, because I'm in
[SPEAKER_02]: the midst of moving from Ohio to Oregon,
and everything is packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the two or three days I had to
put this together, I was unable to get
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he went over there first on an
Alexander von Humboldt Senior Research
[SPEAKER_02]: Award from 1994 and again in 1996,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he worked on Reiny Church that
Winifred Remy had been working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he worked, actually, some with Remy,
but more with Hans Kerp and his technician
[SPEAKER_02]: and collaborator, Hagen Haas, and most
recently with Michael Krings, who he's
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with very extensively recently and
is a co-author on the fossil fungi book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been an extremely important
collaboration, both for paleomycology and
[SPEAKER_02]: for biological interactions through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the last thing that Tom has
done, which has made a really major
[SPEAKER_02]: impact, is Antarctic paleobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the Permian Triassic, and more
recently, up into the Jurassic,
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's really good stuff that's
starting to come out of there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's Tom dressed for the helo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to put this in perspective,
the James Morton shop, or old Jim shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: who was one of our paleobotanical
patriarchs in the 1960s, was at the US
[SPEAKER_02]: Geological Survey Cold Geology Lab in
Orton Hall on the Ohio State University
[SPEAKER_02]: campus, across the campus from Tom when he
was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jim was working on Antarctic fossils
in the 60s and into the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he died in the late 70s,
Tom picked up the material, looked it over
[SPEAKER_02]: and realized that there was just a huge
amount of work to be done with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shop had just barely scratched the
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he picked up the mantle from shop at
that time and extended it into Permian
[SPEAKER_02]: Triassic and Jurassic church and
compression floors that we've seen so much
[SPEAKER_02]: of over the last few years with Tom and
his students and his post-docs and his
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's some pictures from Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great picture of Tom looking
content and here's some of the people he
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with, John Isabel and Ruben Cunio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be Isabel and this will be Ruben
in somewhat younger days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first Antarctic trip that Tom
took where he went with Edie and Ruth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Tom's easy to pick out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's Ruth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were not only collecting but they
were doing things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're building an igloo because when you
went down there at that time, you had to
[SPEAKER_02]: do survival training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you had to build yourself a shelter
and stay in it overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since, well, overnight even though
there's no dark, it's light all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they are, the penguin rookery.
[SPEAKER_02]: The penguins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Ruth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working from a snowmobile or a skadoo and
Edie there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here we are packing up fossils.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go with him on the first trip but
I went with him a couple of times later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more shots of life when you're camping
out in Antarctica and collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the source of the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets boxed up in crates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets put on the ship, shipped back and
arrives several months after you get back.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest camps they have is at
Beardmore Glacier and here's the 1976 crew
[SPEAKER_02]: at Beardmore Glacier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some of my favorite pictures from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought that this was Tom being
serious about having people collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is his certificate of completing
the snowcraft and survival school in 1985.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how much he's enjoying
himself in that environment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another area where Tom was extremely
influential was in building our
[SPEAKER_02]: discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom has been an excellent and extremely
important builder of paleobotany at the
[SPEAKER_02]: national and international levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very important in building the
International Organization of Paleobotany
[SPEAKER_02]: where he was president at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1984 he went to the University of
Alberta for six months and he and Ruth
[SPEAKER_02]: organized the second International
Organization of Paleobotany conference at
[SPEAKER_02]: the University of Alberta and had
spectacular field trips there.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are shots of a Paleocene locality
and here's how they made the fossils
[SPEAKER_02]: available to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran in there with the bulldozer and
cut shelves back so that people would just
[SPEAKER_02]: go in and collect the fossils and
spectacular collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also had a champagne and watermelon
at the end of the collecting trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tom always did everything with class.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to lots of places in the
Canadian Rockies while they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he is with Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are some Japanese graduate
students on the Athabasca Glacier where
[SPEAKER_02]: there are pools of water and they would
stick their hand down in the water and
[SPEAKER_02]: time them to see who was the toughest and
could keep it in there the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom had a lot of family in terms of
scholastic family and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people with whom he was very
close and influenced extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked very closely with Don Eggert for
many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were together at the University of
Illinois at Chicago Circle in the late 60s
[SPEAKER_02]: and early 70s and at that time it was
probably the most active paleobotany lab
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a dozen graduate students going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are some of this crew,
including here's Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other side?
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He washed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Eric Carfalt and Marion Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Ruth and Edie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be cookie-true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marie, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was at a meeting around 1970 maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for a picture that was old
enough for Bill not to have white hair but
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately we were able to have a
celebration for Tom when he turned 75 in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a celebration of that at the
paleobotanical banquet at the Botanical
[SPEAKER_02]: Society meetings and then later in
September that year at the IOPC we had a
[SPEAKER_02]: symposium dedicated to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that came a special issue of the
International Journal of Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, oh I've forgotten, 24,
25 papers by almost 50 authors,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of whom had been very closely
associated with Tom as students,
[SPEAKER_02]: former students, students of former
students, post-docs, former post-docs,
[SPEAKER_02]: close collaborators, and people he worked
with in building the international
[SPEAKER_02]: organization of paleobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were delighted to be able to honor
him with that in the Thomas N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taylor Diamond Jubilee special issue of
the International Journal of Plant
[SPEAKER_02]: Sciences that came out in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the last thing I want to talk about is
Tom as a poet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think of Tom as a poet but his
students do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brings out some of Tom in a more
personal sense, the types of things which
[SPEAKER_02]: have made, endeared his students to him
and him to his students.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would write poems for his students and
leave them on their desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now fortunately I cleared out of the lab
before he discovered he could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he often did that with, when somebody
had done something that was a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: embarrassing, either that or somebody had
done something that was really
[SPEAKER_02]: outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Charlie Goode at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read the beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There once was an employee named Goode who
worked with fossils as best he could.
[SPEAKER_02]: His talents and drive were better than
most.
[SPEAKER_02]: He even was known to occasionally boast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little dig at him there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll just skip down the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie had screwed something up and he
left the note on his desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to read all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one that he wrote for Edie when she
was his student where she had,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, done a misidentification which he
brought to her attention with this poem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one for Lisa Boucher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one for Jeff Osborne.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a real long one from Murray
Kerman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since these are going to go up,
I'm not going to bother to, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to read them because I don't have the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over the years, Ruth was complaining
that he never wrote a poem for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the, Ruth Rose that we had when
she retired from the University of Alberta
[SPEAKER_02]: that was held last year, he wrote a poem
for her and he read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I will play that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There once was a last named stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my poems begin, there once was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There once was a last named stocky whose
climb to the top was always rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: She labored away night and day searching
for perfection some did say.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a reason that is still far from clear,
this last stocky was sometimes heard to
[SPEAKER_00]: cheer her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pines, aricarians, and even you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a gymnosperm gal through and through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me stomata with sunken guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hold climate secrets that are known
to cast spells.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place in the sun where all will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first to describe them and not
just for show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research was solid and easy to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got funded to travel here and there,
do comparative studies with much to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: gymnosperms are great, but now past their
hay day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will I do for the years to come?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe teach students that are far too
dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haploid, diploid, sorus, and spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferns might be fun, but the researchers
are boars.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now she had traveled some distance away
where the winters are cold and the snow is
[SPEAKER_00]: all play.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a land where all cars continue to
stall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also the home of the Edmonton
Mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now entered a wise man named Stuart who
said, Ruthie, my dear, you won't need a
[SPEAKER_00]: sled to visit a site I know very well
where the summers are great and the
[SPEAKER_00]: winters are hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flora there screams, visit our grave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you stuff that will make even
Rockwell rage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many hold secrets that some will scorn,
but we were around here before even you
[SPEAKER_00]: were born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers abound, they're all over the place
with perianth parts in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grew in waters, others got dry land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Princeton's our name, so give us a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set you off to publish more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your students and colleagues,
some in a huff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about the data we humbly hold,
new hypotheses for paleobotany that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: easily solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she went to Princeton, not Yale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting megatons and rock and even some
shale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flabbing the stuff and looking for plants
some even with fungi in their pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her bio got longer, her curiosity
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this stuff she said to all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Eocene is great, it's even a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day a new friend would say,
there's a place that I call the Appian
[SPEAKER_00]: Way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petrified stuff all over the place,
nodules and rocks, some even in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it went for this site too,
papers and talks, more research to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this getting too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: In reading this poem to a mate one night,
whose eyes rolled up and then out of
[SPEAKER_00]: sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it Tom, I can take no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your colleagues will think you're a
terrible bore.
[SPEAKER_00]: After crying out loud, this shameless poet
did say, I've given to Ruth her special
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A verse for her that is long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like the rhymes here,
then screw all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, when Tom became
really ill in the last month, Ruth wrote a
[SPEAKER_02]: poem for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try not to screw it up too badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A poem for Tom Taylor.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Ruth's stocky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There once was a botanist named Taylor,
who said that I talked like a sailor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mentor and friend, no horses rear end,
a prince of a fellow, Tom Taylor.
[SPEAKER_02]: His microscopy type was scanning,
flames of palynology, then he was fanning,
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen in spores, no study for bores,
carboniferous cobalt in planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: His partner in crime was named Donald,
a guy with no need to be coddled.
[SPEAKER_02]: They blew up the truck with a little bad
luck, falling rocks was the story they
[SPEAKER_02]: modeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fern they named Tidelia, with fern
characteristics, Socuria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Named for Delivorius, the name was just
glorious, but Norwoodia, oh my oh deos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom perfected the method of peeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ground paci testa with verb and with
feeling, carboniferous seeds fulfilled all
[SPEAKER_02]: his needs, but in time needed work more
appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Left Chicago for Athens, Ohio,
an additional notch on his bio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start of interest in fungi, we all know
this fun guy, was a scientist there for
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calamites, radstockia, and seed ferns,
bomenides, saccate pollen, and we learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny toward reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: He moved on to Columbus, Ohio,
to be chairman, department of bio.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dandelion bloomed, and insurrection
loomed, but he triumphed in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: meal mile.
[SPEAKER_02]: His students, the line should be towing,
darkroom whining on time, spent is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, help with foot fatigue,
called these workers bush league.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rubber matting, the solution, now showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: His wisdom for his students legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this lab, no need to stall or ever
tarry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your pubs drafted, or else you'll get
shafted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now good jobs are what's customary.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my lab, you'll get a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: in moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cobalt from the strata we're
removing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Publish or perish, the motto we cherish,
it's hypothesis we should be proving.
[SPEAKER_02]: All his students at the uni, so
productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Studied gymnosperms, horsetails,
and ferns, reproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for cathartic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll collect the Antarctic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glossoptera sure sounds seductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beardmore Glacier Laboratory, students
added to the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fossil plant, explanatory, working on
their oratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambium and fossil phloem, some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deserved a poem.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of their work is laudatory,
added greatly to his glory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many reconstructions of whole plants,
even gave us time to work on grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferns and fungi from Triassic
Developmental Studies, classic paleobotany
[SPEAKER_02]: ramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: From fossil plants, from the chert known
as rhynie, with fungi included so tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Studied with hagenhass and others with
class.
[SPEAKER_02]: With life cycles that formerly stymie.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Permian studies of free rings,
conifers, cuticles, and like things,
[SPEAKER_02]: lichens, and acai, the studies were
classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria with McHale creams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennsylvania leaf, epiphyte fungi,
were described by this famous once
[SPEAKER_02]: Buckeye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cones of the cycad, spores found in dyads,
were papers with his old alumni.
[SPEAKER_02]: His paleo books have been well received,
even better than we all believed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biology and evolution was his great
contribution, each particularly well
[SPEAKER_02]: achieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will be his future goals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will he study petioles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will he macerate some coals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will he have new founded roles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Must stay away from all assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We who have benefited from his
instruction, succumb to paleo botanical
[SPEAKER_02]: seduction, learn the powers of botanical
deduction, practice whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: reconstruction, try to emanate his
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is Ruth recapitulating Tom's
career and his effect on his students and
[SPEAKER_02]: colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are a list of awards and honors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will point out that his awards include
Distinguished Scholar, Distinguished
[SPEAKER_02]: Teaching Awards, here's his National
Academy of Science electing, amongst the
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, as an example of what one can be,
and what we all wish that we were,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what students still can be,
so long Tom, we miss you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
