[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Alina.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I actually spent a year
working for the USDA, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a finger in many pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so this first slide is to characterize
basically my good fortune.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was coming back from when the
Arabidopsis meeting was in Beijing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I had like four to 48 hours in Paris.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went to the Louvre, and they had
this thing where they were taking modern
[SPEAKER_04]: art and, oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, I don't know, this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have I done here?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I have broken it already?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've broken this already.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, juxtaposing modern art with
all the ancient stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're actually on one of those moving
runways out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we saw all these life-size plaster of
Paris people wearing lab coats and holding
[SPEAKER_04]: clocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, this is just so perfect for
my lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually had to go out and come back
in so I could walk in there and take a
[SPEAKER_04]: picture of all these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is not a group meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's art.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so the reason for my fascination with
clocks and the whole premise of the field
[SPEAKER_04]: is that a clock that matches the
environmental oscillation will enhance
[SPEAKER_04]: fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course, the rotation of the
earth on its axis means that life has
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved in a world where the environment
changes drastically day and night,
[SPEAKER_04]: but completely predictably.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if the clock is an entity that
allows the organism to coordinate its
[SPEAKER_04]: biology with this daily oscillation in the
environment around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nowhere is this better illustrated
than in this movie that some of you may
[SPEAKER_04]: have seen from Roger Hangar to make this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a sunflower plant growing in
Roger's backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the day in the life of this
sunflower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is east and this is west.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Indiana, so not much is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But over time, the shadows will get
longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it will be illuminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: The action is all at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll be illuminated by a single bulb
over his back porch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see the solar tracking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been tracking and keeping its leaves
oriented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, immediately, it completely
reconfigures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's sort of two amazing things
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is it knows where the sun's going to
come up and where breakfast is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it knows when it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's totally ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the best example of dawn
anticipation that I have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really what clocks are about,
to enable you to anticipate what's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: next and adjust your biology to be
appropriate to what's happening next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I always like to put this in,
particularly when it's not a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: audience, because I like to sort of poke
the animal folks in the eye a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But given that it's largely a plant
audience, this hopefully will make you all
[SPEAKER_04]: feel better about yourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because plants feature almost entirely the
history of study of circadian rhythms is
[SPEAKER_04]: the study of plant circadian rhythms.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Western canon, at least,
the first writings on clocks are those of
[SPEAKER_04]: Androsynes, who was a scribe who went off
with Alexander the Great to define and
[SPEAKER_04]: conquer the known world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he observed leaf movement of a tree,
almost certainly a tamarind, on an island
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Red Sea, now we call Bahrain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no indication that they had any
sense that this was an endogenous,
[SPEAKER_04]: self-sustaining leaf movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, the first writing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Science moved a little slower back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some two millennia later, a French
astronomer finally did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the experiment to ask, is this
endogenous?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took a sensitive heliotrope,
almost certainly a mimosa, and just put it
[SPEAKER_04]: in the dark and asked, do the sleep
movements of the leaves persist?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was quite prescient, because he
suggested there might be a relationship of
[SPEAKER_04]: this behavior in plants to the observed
sleep behaviors in bed-ridden human
[SPEAKER_04]: patients in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, he was quite right,
both product of a clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, science moved slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 years later, two other authors
published books, repeating those
[SPEAKER_04]: observations, getting whole books out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they excluded temperature as having
driven these rhythms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, 100, well, 80 years
later, de Candolle finally got
[SPEAKER_04]: quantitative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to this point, people had said,
OK, leaves are moving or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a circadian period, a daily
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: But finally, de Candolle quantified the
period and determined that the
[SPEAKER_04]: free-running period was not precisely 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: In mimosa, it's about 22 to 23 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I entered the field, we were
still at the end of a long debate with
[SPEAKER_04]: whether or not there was such a thing as a
circadian clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or rather, were these overt phenotypes
that people observed the result of some
[SPEAKER_04]: response to some subtle and undetected
geophysical cue?
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the answer came in here,
because the period wasn't 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it couldn't have been a subtle
geophysical cue, because that would have
[SPEAKER_04]: had a 24-hour period, like the rotation of
the Earth and its axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it had to be endogenous.
[SPEAKER_04]: People still didn't believe until they
finally put Neurospora up in Skylab,
[SPEAKER_04]: removed it from the Earth cycle,
and it continued to show its daily rhythm
[SPEAKER_04]: and canadiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But up until now, everything's all in
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't until, I think it was 1898,
when finally they observed rhythms and
[SPEAKER_04]: pigmentation in some crabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't observe rhythms or
systemic behavior in rodents, rats,
[SPEAKER_04]: and mice until about 1924 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, the history of clocks is the
history of plant clocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And animals are recent interlopers.
[SPEAKER_04]: In plants, basically, whatever you're
doing, there's a good chance that there
[SPEAKER_04]: will be an influence of time of day on
that phenomenon, which is really an
[SPEAKER_04]: inconvenient truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's my assertion to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we know that growth responses,
elongation growth happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gated to particular times of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many examples of metabolic
gating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we know the clock influences
photoperiodic flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And recent events, and I'll show you a
couple of examples, have provided evidence
[SPEAKER_04]: that the ability to perceive and mount a
response to biotic or abiotic stresses can
[SPEAKER_04]: be a function of the time of day at which
that stress is encountered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really quite pervasive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do rhythms matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give you two examples where they
do matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first, I think, is in many ways the
coolest.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is work from Alexander Graff,
who was a student with Allison Smith.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with starch metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, a rabidopsis stores its excess
photosynthate in the day as starch,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then at night degrades that to provide
carbon for growth and respiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it would be bad if you
burned it all up and ran out.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is that at dusk, the plant
makes a calculation how much starch did I
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulate today, consults its clock,
and anticipates when dawn is going to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: and adjusts its starch degradation rates
to be linear, such that starch reserves
[SPEAKER_04]: are just about but not quite exhausted at
dawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you fool it by a delaying dawn,
the plant does the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: This linear burn runs out of starch,
induces a carbon starvation response,
[SPEAKER_04]: and growth falls off dramatically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's one great example that may be
why it's important to have a clock to do
[SPEAKER_04]: this calculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the title of one of the
reviews was Plants Do Arithmetic Division.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one, here's another one for
those of you who like caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cabbage loopers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to devour a rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Goodspeed et al.
[SPEAKER_04]: in Janet Bram's lab did a totally cool
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: They entrained the loopers and the plants
in phase with one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they both think days when day is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an activity rhythm and a
feeding rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trichoplusae and e are active during
the daytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're in phase with the plants,
everybody thinks it's daytime,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's some herbivory and some growth
of the loopers, but the plants survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, however, you entrain the plants and
the loopers out of phase with one another,
[SPEAKER_04]: such that the looper is active when it
thinks it's day, but the plant thinks it's
[SPEAKER_04]: night, the plants are devastated,
and the loopers proliferate and get big
[SPEAKER_04]: and fat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, now what we know is that
they're cycling jasmonic acid levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there's a trade-off between
defense and growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant is just making JA when it
anticipates the activity rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the rhythm of the looper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems if you disrupt that
relationship, it's bad news for the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here are two examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are many, many other examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no one thing you can look at and
say, this is why clocks enhance fitness so
[SPEAKER_04]: far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably an incremental improvement
on lots of different processes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you think is most important.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we call that?
[SPEAKER_04]: An ascertainment bias.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's whatever you think is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look at it, and you'll find it,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to define some terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So circadian, the term means it's from the
Latin, approximately, circa,
[SPEAKER_04]: approximately, dies day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are rhythms that have a period
length of approximately, but not exactly,
[SPEAKER_04]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're endogenous.
[SPEAKER_04]: They persist in the absence of
environmental time cues.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, we live in a world that's
replete with environmental time cues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so clocks are entrainable to
environmental time cues, chiefly
[SPEAKER_04]: light-dark cycles, but also temperature
cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the case of you folks, most of whom I
think are humans, if you fly to Japan,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to be jet-lagged.
[SPEAKER_04]: The light-dark cycles, take a walk at
noon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll help you entrain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also social cues, taking your meals on
time, having a beer at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these sorts of social cues will help
to entrain your clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of terms that I'll mention a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't mention amplitude much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your sine wave physics from high
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half the peak to trough distance is one
amplitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in training conditions, when we're
providing a light-dark cycle, the period
[SPEAKER_04]: will be entrained to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're releasing to continuous
conditions, the gray is when the lights
[SPEAKER_04]: would have gone off had they gone off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see, revealed the free running
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this example, it's a little longer than
24, about 25 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So traditionally, we thought about the
clock in sort of a linear cascade.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's entrained through input pathways,
light, temperature, temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: imbibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, I mean the hydration of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the social cues of taking your
beer on time will help you entrain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are output rhythms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene expression, I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a lot about leaf movements,
seminal aperture, other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this linear pathway is not sufficient
to think about this, because we know
[SPEAKER_04]: there's gating.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, the plant, through
clock-regulated expression, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: of phytochromes, modulates its own
sensitivity to light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can think about that with a plant,
but also with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: A pulse of light applied to you at noon
doesn't affect your clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's light at noon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that same pulse of light applied to
you in the pre-dawn hours, you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, my goodness, I've overslept.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lights are on already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you advance your clock to match what
you've now perceived as a new dawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: That same pulse of light applied to you
after dusk, you think, oh, I thought the
[SPEAKER_04]: sun went down, but it just went down
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you delay your clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very contextual.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time-of-day dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's this gating phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, many of the output pathways
have intermediates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's now becoming clear in a number of
ways that various intermediates in these
[SPEAKER_04]: output pathways, metabolites like sugar,
nutrients like organic nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_04]: iron, copper, are actually feeding back,
again, to modulate clock function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're setting up all these to
be appropriate at time of day,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're interacting, interacting with
the rest of the organism, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're monitoring key metabolites to try
and fine-tune the clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a linear pathway at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a network pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to think of the clock,
I think, as an integrator of cellular
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolism and organismal physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's the way I'm trying to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Work from a lot of labs, among them that
of Steve Kay in Arabidopsis, have gone a
[SPEAKER_04]: long way towards defining the architecture
and the components and the
[SPEAKER_04]: interrelationships of these components in
the plant clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, like all these complicated
machines, it gets complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people simplify it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it gets complex again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in a period of slight
simplification.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, there are a whole bunch of
transcription factors, most of which are
[SPEAKER_04]: repressors.
[SPEAKER_04]: At dawn, CCA1 and LHY, two single-mib
domain transcription factors, are
[SPEAKER_04]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they repress a whole bunch of other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this morning component.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also evening components.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are arrayed according to times
of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an evening complex and TOC1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are also repressors.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is, after a period of time,
certain transcriptional activators turn on
[SPEAKER_04]: this bridging group, and they turn off
this, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with all this interrelated on-off,
you can build up a stable 24-hour
[SPEAKER_04]: oscillation with these feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on your love of complexity,
you can add way more arrows and more
[SPEAKER_04]: components to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does look a little bit like a
hairball.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the real question now to me,
well, one of the real questions is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is Arabidopsis a good model?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we take this and move it in to apply
it to other plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was the challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And particularly, I didn't really want to
take on that challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, when the Plant Genome
Project got going at the NSF, plant genome
[SPEAKER_04]: means any plant genome except for that of
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I needed to, if I wanted to get
money, I needed to find a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend and collaborator,
Cynthia Weining, said, got the system for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found a great population of recombinant
egg-bread lines in Brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I said, OK, let's put in a grant to
work on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got funded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now, many years later, we're still
working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So transition to a crop, Brassica rapa,
it's a Arabidopsis on steroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabidopsis flower, Brassica flower,
Arabidopsis seed, Brassica seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabidopsis seedling, Brassica seedling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's bigger, but it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are a couple of other
twists that will come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cultivated crop, Napa cabbage,
turnip, Chinese cabbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's highly playmorphic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you a slide on that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also an invasive weed, but it's
closely related to Arabidopsis on
steroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also to maybe a mega crop,
like being Canadian, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: canola.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought this was a good place to
start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't really realize at the time,
but Brassica rapa doesn't transform
[SPEAKER_04]: terribly well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really a limitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we wanted a nice, non-invasive,
non-transgenic assay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that, we went back to the assay
that drove circadian rhythm research for
[SPEAKER_04]: many millennia, that is leaf movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a Brassica seedling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what these guys do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the leaves go up and down once a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cotyledons, the true leaves do as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll come back to this later,
but we wanted to greatly enhance our
[SPEAKER_04]: throughput.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we first did our first recombinant
inbred line population, it was 150 lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it at three temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that took three postdoc years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we wanted to do was scale up and
steal from Ed Buckler's playbook and start
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at nested association mapping
populations and look at more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we wanted to do 1,050 genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't have, like, 30 postdoc years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way that was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to streamline the analytic
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem was there was just too
much operator input.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went to a friend of mine,
this guy here, Hany Farid, who's chair of
[SPEAKER_04]: our computer science department.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, Hany, I know in your deep,
dark past you did automated motion
[SPEAKER_04]: detection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any code that can you help us
with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said he thought he could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he wrote this great code that
basically takes successive frames of pixel
[SPEAKER_04]: and draws a motion vector from where that
pixel is in frame one, frame n,
[SPEAKER_04]: to where it is in frame n plus 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what these blue lines are,
these motion vectors going from frame to
[SPEAKER_04]: frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you simply sum all the vectors at
each interval.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can plot out a motion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's totally user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just click one button, and you get the
whole thing back from all your plans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we, oh, Hany, I want you back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we plot that out, and you get nice
automated digital readout that's
[SPEAKER_04]: quantitative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can then do a Fourier transform and
extract the rhythmic parameters on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here are traces from the two
parents of this recombinant inbred line
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is much taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, it's growing very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, they look pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go up and down once a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what they actually look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oil seed is yellow, narrow,
thinner seed coat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can pack more oil in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rapid cycler imb211 has dark seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see this is bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this guy's already flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rapid cycler.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recombinant inbred line population
generated from these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so first, we want to know,
is there variation among accessions of
[SPEAKER_04]: Brasparappa in terms of circadian
parameters?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just went to a Dutch SOC center and
got 50 cultivated accessions, measured
[SPEAKER_04]: circadian period length at three different
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we saw quite a range of circadian
period length.
[SPEAKER_04]: We then applied that to the 150
recombinant inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in every case, we see transgressive
variation and a lot of variation,
[SPEAKER_04]: every bit as much variation among these
lines derived from the two parents that
[SPEAKER_04]: are indicated by the circle and the square
as we saw in this global collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can map QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so while we were mapping QTL for
circadian periods, Cynthia was mapping QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: for all kinds of morphometric parameters
and physiological parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea was then we bring the two
together and correlate them and ask,
[SPEAKER_04]: is clock function contributing to some of
these other functions?
[SPEAKER_04]: When we did this, we observed a QTL at
this position on chromosome 9.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at this point, the BRASCA genome
had just been released.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a sense of what candidate genes
were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I want to introduce one of the
complications.
[SPEAKER_04]: BRASCA rapa is just like a rabidopsis on
steroids, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: But since the separation of a rabidopsis
from BRASCA from a rabidopsis it's
[SPEAKER_04]: undergone a whole genome triplication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we mapped out where all the various
candidate genes were based on symphony
[SPEAKER_04]: with the rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a candidate underlying this one
where there was only one copy had been
[SPEAKER_04]: retained.
[SPEAKER_04]: After polyploidization, you get a lot of
fractionation, a lot of gene loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought if we picked one where there's
just a single copy, life would potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: be simpler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the gene underlying that particular
QTL was a gene called gigantia,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is known in a rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabidopsis to be important for flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loss of function mutation is very late
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also for circadian function.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought that's a good candidate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing we did was try and
confirm genetically that there really was
[SPEAKER_04]: a gene in that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were lucky in doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally you'd make nils or something like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got the population of rils very
early.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were only been sulked about three
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was still a lot of residual
heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could take one of the rils that was
heterozygous over the QTL and simply self
[SPEAKER_04]: it and generate two parents in an
otherwise homozygous background with the
[SPEAKER_04]: parental DNA either from R500 or IMB211.
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing that, we had a recombination
event that greatly reduced the interval.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could simply compare these two lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, there was a statistically
significant difference in period that was
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: IMB211 has a longer period than R500.
[SPEAKER_04]: So OK, there's something there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Gigantia were to be the gene that's
responsible, presumably there'd be some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of polymorphism between the two
alleles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we re-sequenced the two alleles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found a ton of SNPs, three of which
were actually predicted to be missense
[SPEAKER_04]: mutations changing the amino acid
sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: A serine to alanine and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we went right to the transgenic
endgame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you we can't transform brassica
terribly well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just went into a rabidopsis,
put the brassica alleles into a
[SPEAKER_04]: rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got very lucky and got a home run
with the first experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we introduced the IMB allele
into a rabidopsis, nothing happened to
[SPEAKER_04]: circadian period length.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we introduced the R500 allele,
and that's the one with shorter period
[SPEAKER_04]: brassica, we had a significant shortening
of circadian period length.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were three mutations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started making chimeric genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, the final thing we simply
made point was a mutation to recapitulate
[SPEAKER_04]: this mutation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the IMB-211 allele that doesn't
shorten circadian period length,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we simply make that one nucleotide
change, change that amino acid to the R500
[SPEAKER_04]: version, it now shortens period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the current first R500 shortens
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we change that back to the IMB
residue at that position, it feels to
[SPEAKER_04]: shorten period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the gene, and that's the
nucleotide, and that's the amino acid
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biochemically, mechanistically,
we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is the mutation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like the two alleles,
one is active, the other is inactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because both alleles fully rescue the late
flowering phenotype of a loss of function
[SPEAKER_04]: gigantea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're active, equally active for
flowering timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And gigantea turned out to be,
we didn't know when we started this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it does a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew about there was a hypocotyl
phenotype difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything in actuality but circadian
period applies to the hypocotyl phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it turns out loss of gigantea
function in Arabidopsis confers tolerance
[SPEAKER_04]: to cold, enhances tolerance to cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's seen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's able to tolerate lower temperatures
than wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the IMB-211 allele eliminates that,
whereas the R500 allele does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chimeric genes behave
consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a similar phenotype that I
took out, apparently, with salt tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that behaves the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to ask, OK, that's all in
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this mutation matter and do the same
things in Brassica rapa?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that, I've always relied on the
kindness of friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lars Istegard at the John Innes
Institute had developed a spectacular
[SPEAKER_04]: tilling population in an oil seed RO18
that's closely related to R500.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we sent him $2,500.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent us 22 alleles of gigantea,
including four of which were presumptive
[SPEAKER_04]: loss of function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here are two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's late flowering, a loss of
gigantea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's late flowering, enhances freezing
tolerance, and enhances salt tolerance in
[SPEAKER_04]: Brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's behaving quite similar to the
Arabidopsis story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also doesn't do much to circadian
rhythmicity at 18 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at 22 degrees, it really flattens out
the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big loss of amplitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's clock active as well there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got a QT allele.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brassica, as I mentioned, is highly
pleomorphic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look in Brassica rapa,
it's all these various.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's turnips, and there's leafy
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we're more familiar in North
America with the Oloracea equivalents,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's cabbage and Brussels sprouts
and cauliflower and broccoli and so on and
[SPEAKER_04]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of this may be because of this
tripletization, providing the material for
[SPEAKER_04]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we know that gene
duplication underlies the radiation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: angiosperms below all the important
divisions right before the ancestral gene
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, there was a whole genome
duplication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the ancestral angiosperm,
there's a whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're Arabidopsis centric,
you're familiar with the gamma,
[SPEAKER_04]: beta, and alpha duplications on the road
to Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this little triangle up here in
Brassica rapa is this recent whole genome
[SPEAKER_04]: triplication that's gone on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so typically, these events are
followed by a great deal of fractionation,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of gene loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we wanted to evaluate
candidates for our clock QT allele,
[SPEAKER_04]: we wanted to map all the various
Arabidopsis clock genes on the basis of
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we did that, we realized we could
ask the question, are clock genes
[SPEAKER_04]: fractionated lost at the same rate as
everything else, or are they somehow
[SPEAKER_04]: different?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jim Birchler and Mike Freling have
elaborated this dosage hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_04]: says that genes that are highly networked
or genes that are dosage dependent cannot
[SPEAKER_04]: be lost following a whole genome
duplication because you throw off that
[SPEAKER_04]: dosage balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, all the genes in the clock
are semi-dominant and dosage sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we thought, well, maybe they're
preferentially retained.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we started looking, we started
thinking this might be the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one gene family of five
pseudo-response regulators, PRR9,
[SPEAKER_04]: 7, 5, 3, and PRR1, which is also more
commonly known as TAC1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll notice for PRR5, there's three
copies.
[SPEAKER_04]: For PRR9, there's two copies, two copies
for PRR7.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they're preferentially
retained, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we compared the clock genes to the
10 synthetic genes around each of the
[SPEAKER_04]: clock genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the clock genes, about 60% of them are
retained in RAPA, whereas only about 40%
[SPEAKER_04]: of the synthetic genes were.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, they are preferentially retained.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could be that this whole genome
duplication business in plants underlies
[SPEAKER_04]: the proliferation of clock genes and just
empirically, when you look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: hairballs to describe the oscillator in
animals versus plants, they look a little
[SPEAKER_04]: more complicated in plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you look from a single-celled
alga through moss to Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_04]: Nebraska, you can just see a proliferation
of potential clock genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're very curious whether or not
this has, whether there's now
[SPEAKER_04]: neo-functionalization and
sub-functionalization in RAPA relative to
[SPEAKER_04]: what we know in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to talk about that today,
but those are ongoing projects in the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to describe the circadian
transcriptome in RAPA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we just set up to do a classic
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You entrain plants to a light-dark cycle,
release them into continuous light and
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've harvested tissue every two hours
for 48 hours using this oilseed,
[SPEAKER_04]: R500.
[SPEAKER_04]: And starting to look at it, look at this,
and so here's a set of clock genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are present, three of them are
present in two copies in RAPA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Third one's present in three copies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just in this survey, and this is
representative of what we see and other
[SPEAKER_04]: people have seen, typically when you start
looking at one of these polyploids,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can fractionate the genomes and there
will be a dominant genome and a
[SPEAKER_04]: sub-dominant genome, or genomes,
where one of the genomes is expressed at
[SPEAKER_04]: higher level than the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that here one copy of LHY,
that MIB domain transcription factor is
[SPEAKER_04]: expressed at higher level than the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with TOC1, same with PRR7.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same is true with PRR5, where PRR5,
what we're calling the C copy here,
[SPEAKER_04]: is expressed at higher level.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we start seeing evidence,
perhaps, of perhaps some sub-functional
[SPEAKER_04]: ization going on, because you'll notice
one of these genes, PRR5B, is peaking
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier than the other two, C and A.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we don't know if these are now
starting to subdivide functions up or
[SPEAKER_04]: acquire new functions, but certainly in
terms of the pattern of transcript
[SPEAKER_04]: abundance, we're starting to see changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see this in some but not in all of
the genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you start trying to sort these out
and the various clustering algorithms,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're using network analysis to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the predominant things when you
sort the transcriptome is time of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can sort this out into clusters on
the basis of time of day of the peak of
[SPEAKER_04]: transcript abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: ZT, that's a Zeitgeber time, it's from the
German time giver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dawn, the last dark to light transition is
ZT0, and then you scale from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're doing a light-dark cycle,
you go ZT0 up to 24, which becomes zero
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can bin them out according to
phase and see clusters of genes at all the
[SPEAKER_04]: different times.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just the first few phases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can start also doing network analysis,
for example, in this family of the three
[SPEAKER_04]: PRR5 genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 5B that's peaking early is now in a
network that's distinct from the two
[SPEAKER_04]: copies of 5C and 5A that are peaking a
little later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these have targets in gray that are in
common, as well as own co-expressed,
[SPEAKER_04]: not targets, but co-expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're starting to see some
subdivision of the networks among the
[SPEAKER_04]: different copies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think that may be offering the
opportunity for greater complexity in
[SPEAKER_04]: fractioning out genome expression,
but we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to start looking at response to
biotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mentioned gating, the idea that the
ability to mount a response will be a
[SPEAKER_04]: function of the time of day at which the
stress is encountered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's sort of illustrated here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we provide a stress, say, at this
point, we might get one response.
[SPEAKER_04]: At dawn, we might get one response.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we provided at dusk, we might get a
different response on a basic transcript
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, what people encounter when they
do this is they see if there's a basal
[SPEAKER_04]: rhythm in the transcript, it tends to be
that the peak in response to perturbation
[SPEAKER_04]: tends to be at the time of peak
expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was first observed by Andrew Miller
working with Steve Kay, quite a while ago
[SPEAKER_04]: now, just looking at the
light-inducibility of cab genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they peak in about the middle of the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that turns out to be, if you put them
in the dark and give them pulses of light,
[SPEAKER_04]: you trace their basal waveform on their
inducibility, or their inducibility simply
[SPEAKER_04]: mimics that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're maximally expressed,
that's when you get maximum induction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're anticipating seeing something
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been seen by Mike Tomashow's
lab, for example, in cold induction of the
[SPEAKER_04]: CBFs, where if you provide a cold pulse
four hours after dawn, you get strong
[SPEAKER_04]: induction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you provide the same cold pulse 16
hours after dawn, you get very minimal
[SPEAKER_04]: induction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's this circadian gating of
the induction of the cold regulon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to look at drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, corn yields, if you look,
whenever there's a dip, often that's
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with a dry year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we thought we could look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Olivia Wilkins had suggested that
there was a circadian gating of drought
[SPEAKER_04]: responses in both Arabidopsis and Poplar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought this would be a good place
to look in Brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that there's likely to be a
clock intersection from some Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that if you perturb the expression
of TOC1, either overexpress it or do a
[SPEAKER_04]: knockdown or a loss of function mutation,
you see effects on stomatal aperture.
[SPEAKER_04]: In response to ABA, the closing is
attenuated by TOC1 overexpression.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that a triple loss of function
mutation of three of the PRRs,
[SPEAKER_04]: PRR 9, 7, and 5, enhances drought
tolerance in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we thought that there's good
evidence suggesting there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: clock intersection with the drought
response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our collaborators, particularly Brent
Ewers and Lena Guadagno at the University
[SPEAKER_04]: of Wyoming, spent a lot of time trying to
get conditions where they could withhold
[SPEAKER_04]: water and get a gradual loss of soil water
moisture and look in the earliest stages
[SPEAKER_04]: of the drought response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's soil moisture in well-watered
versus our droughted plants over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We withheld water a day before this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking in the second and third
days of drought here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're seeing only small changes in
stomatal conductance in the well-watered
[SPEAKER_04]: versus the droughted plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a very early response.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are a long way from wilting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're going to look.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys, the Wyoming guys, are going to
look at a lot of physiological parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to look at the
transcriptomic response.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they measured a photosynthetic rate,
stomatal conductance, photosystem II
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency, non-structural carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are not much for photosynthetic
rate, but we see a stomatal conductance
[SPEAKER_04]: changes with it depleted and the droughted
plants late in the day, sort of what you
[SPEAKER_04]: might expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see perhaps compensations in
photosystem II efficiency, which seems to
[SPEAKER_04]: be slightly greater in the droughted
plants that may be why photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon assimilation doesn't fall off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see some changes that are
significant, but I'm not sure I understand
[SPEAKER_04]: them at all in non-structural
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are subtle physiological changes
in the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we look at the transcriptome,
one of the things we see that's predicted
[SPEAKER_04]: from what Olivia Wilkins had done is that
if you do a cladogram, the droughted and
[SPEAKER_04]: well-watered plants cluster together
according to time of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a massive re-sculpting of the
transcriptome in response to the clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's big time of day changes,
about a third of the transcriptome cycles,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on where and how you look.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we actually see then is the
time of day signal is predominant over any
[SPEAKER_04]: response to this slight drought condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're looking are for subtle
changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a weighted gene correlation
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene correlation expression network
analysis, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're going to split this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make a droughted network,
a droughted and a well-watered network.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to establish consensus by
comparing the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to look for modules,
groups of co-expressed genes, that respond
[SPEAKER_04]: and are correlated with the physiological
data and unique to the droughted network.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very early days in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can set up, and the different
modules are colored, color-coordinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can do that with well-watered and
droughted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can split them up into modules.
[SPEAKER_04]: The top eight modules from each network
contain about 80% to 85% of the expressed
[SPEAKER_04]: genes in these top modules are cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to phrase it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we can take a well-watered
network and that shows, here's the
[SPEAKER_04]: eigen-gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's peaking in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if we re-examine those genes,
actually, they've now subdivided into
[SPEAKER_04]: three subnetworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, that looks much like the parental
network, unperturbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But two, this network and this network,
you can see a broadening of the peak in
[SPEAKER_04]: the daytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's sort of a broadening and a
phase advance of the trough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are subtle responses in how,
of course, we don't at this point know
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're functionally important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can start seeing perturbations in
response to drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at these physiological
traits, we can correlate them with the
[SPEAKER_04]: expression profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can observe, for example,
here's a group that's positively
[SPEAKER_04]: correlated with the physiology with carbon
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an example of a group, a module,
that's negatively correlated with Fe over
[SPEAKER_04]: Fm.
[SPEAKER_04]: In creating this curve, we flip to take an
absolute value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why it looks like a positive
correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's, of course, other modules
that simply are not correlated with
[SPEAKER_04]: somatoconductance in this regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're starting to see are things
where they're peaking in the drought and
[SPEAKER_04]: not, or the amplitude of the peak is up in
droughted versus well-watered conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And inspection by eye, when you look at
this, OK, here's the pattern that I told
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the well-watered network, in the
well-watered, this transcript is peaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the amplitude is increased under
droughted conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, inspection by eye is pretty
unsatisfying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've tried a number of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to identify rhythmic genes is one
of the challenges in transmission.
[SPEAKER_04]: And scriptomic level analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people, John Hoganesh and his
colleagues at Penn, have developed
[SPEAKER_04]: something called JTK cycle that is a way
of evaluating the significance of
[SPEAKER_04]: rhythmicity and phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're comparing individual
transcripts in the droughted and
[SPEAKER_04]: well-watered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking for transcripts that
either are not rhythmic in droughted and
[SPEAKER_04]: acquire rhythmicity in well-watered,
or are not rhythmic in well-watered and
[SPEAKER_04]: acquire rhythmicity in droughted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the converse, or ones where there's an
amplitude change, either up or down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this program is working fairly well
for pulling those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting genes in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can build networks among these
genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's, for example, a network of
drought-responsive genes that are
[SPEAKER_04]: positively correlated with stomatal
conductance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually three overlapping
networks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are, conversely,
drought-responsive genes that are
[SPEAKER_04]: negatively correlated with stomatal
conductance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to parse out the
transcriptome in this sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But our analysis is far from complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, the hard thing is
going to be to relate specific changes
[SPEAKER_04]: with differential drought response.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when does this end?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so we wanted to scale up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave you my honey spiel about how we
could scale up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we wanted to look at a lot of
different plants across the eudicots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we did that, we could observe
in Arabidopsis and other brassicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we went into things like Mimulus and
as far as soybean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that this new program
that Hany wrote for us that we call TRIP,
[SPEAKER_04]: Tracking Rhythms in Plants, seems to be
generally applicable across the eudicots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that allowed us to understand and
investigate one of the things that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been really interested in and started out
talking with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we evaluate a fitness effect of clock
performance?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we started out looking in soybeans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And soybeans, it's a different type of
rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the leaves go up and down quite
nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you can get the motion
vectors on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did was we went to Monsanto and
got 50 elite cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these cultivars have been extensively
bred for basically flowering time and
[SPEAKER_04]: yield performance in latitudinal zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call them maturity zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, they're grown in these
latitudinal zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we looked at circadian period in
these 50 elite cultivars, nobody's messed
[SPEAKER_04]: with their clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody measured their clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we observed a significant positive
correlation of period with latitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you move farther north, the period
lengthens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So were the Monsanto breeders
inadvertently selecting for circadian
[SPEAKER_04]: period length?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, all they were looking for was
performance in these latitudinal zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see this correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great conceit to get it from
Monsanto because, of course, no one's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to doubt that they're well bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is it's the end of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might know what the genes are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not going to know what the genes
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: The agreement didn't include access to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've repeated this now in a wild
population of monkeyflower, Mimulus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And John Willis and Josh Puzi have
collected accessions of Mimulus that grows
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way from the Mexican border up
well into Canada, the Queen Charlotte
[SPEAKER_04]: Islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a huge latitudinal range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two natural history lifestyle habits,
annual and perennial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Among the annuals, there is an even
stronger positive correlation of latitude
[SPEAKER_04]: and circadian period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we're hoping to go is to take
these genotypes and start doing the common
[SPEAKER_04]: garden experiments and ask, does circadian
performance contribute to fitting us in
[SPEAKER_04]: the different latitudes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we want to go with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've expanded dramatically.
[SPEAKER_04]: A high throughput has allowed us to now
look at large numbers of populations of
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is our stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we're using now, it's a cannon power
shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't wait until they're a year old.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hack in and overwrite the software and
turn them into time lapse machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what Hany's program allows us to do is
capture 120 seedlings and then immediately
[SPEAKER_04]: convert it into individual seedling,
temporal image stacks, and then do the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire analysis and release period and
phase data for that seedling and that
[SPEAKER_04]: seedling and that seedling with one click
of the button.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the analytic pipeline is really smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can fit 14 cameras into our
growth room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here's an example of looking at
seven populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: All against a common female parent called
zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: This figure is four and a half million
images.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was about 30 times faster than the
preceding one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hany is a genius as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get what has been shown.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you analyze the individual populations,
you get some QTL for circadian period of
[SPEAKER_04]: fairly low LOD scores.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do the combined analysis,
the LOD scores go way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're way up in significance because
you've increased statistical power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now we're very interested in trying
to identify some of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one we think might be our old friend
Gigantia.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, well, the candidate there is
PRR7.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one in the middle of four is,
as far as we know, novel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're pretty excited if we could
actually get a new clock chain from this
[SPEAKER_04]: quantitative approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: To do this with 1,050 genotypes with all
the replication, we had to do randomized
[SPEAKER_04]: block design.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the postdocs, Katie and Ping,
came to me and said, we can't stand the
[SPEAKER_04]: idea of throwing away the seedlings after
we've measured leaf movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can we look at?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought, well, let's go back to
that example of starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we then took all these plants,
grew them a little longer in a light-dark
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle, and then harvested them and sent
them off to Mark Stitt in Germany for a
[SPEAKER_04]: starch analysis and metabolite analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now on the same population,
we can measure circadian QTL and QTL for
[SPEAKER_04]: residual starch prior to dawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we do that, they really dragged
their feet doing it because they didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: think anything exciting was going to come
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they discovered more variation in
residual starch than it was like an order
[SPEAKER_04]: of magnitude, more than they'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we have QTL for circadian period
and starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it's one or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it's both.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really hoping Mark and Alison
Smith and I have just submitted a proposal
[SPEAKER_04]: to pursue this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Identify some of the genes and really look
at this interplay of the clock with starch
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In six of the populations, you'd predict
if you had a long circadian period,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd anticipate dawn farther out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd be burning your starch at a
slower rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd have more residual starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in every population, there's a
positive correlation between period and
[SPEAKER_04]: residual starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in three of the populations,
it's fairly significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like that's borne out across
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're pretty excited at pursuing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we're going to be going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never would have thought I would be
interested in starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mark and Alison have converted me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in Brassica, Rick Amasino and Scott
Woody have been preparing a series of
[SPEAKER_04]: populations in this Nessus Association
mapping strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hoping to repeat this type of
work in Brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I didn't do any of this myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the product of mostly some great
postdocs, Katie, Victor, Ping,
[SPEAKER_04]: a former postdoc, Qi Guang.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned Hany, a couple of visiting
scientists, Da Ling and Jin Ah from China
[SPEAKER_04]: and Korea, and a horde of really good
undergraduates, current honors thesis
[SPEAKER_04]: student, and a whole bunch of
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our planned genome work has been with Rick
and Scott and Cynthia and Brent and Lena.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Todd and Malia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some collaborators in South
Korea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, Ganesh and Cindy gave us
the soybean cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: John and Josh, all the Mimulus cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mark, this is an optimistic
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just getting started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully, it'll lead to exciting
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I want to thank the
National Science Foundation and the Rural
[SPEAKER_04]: Development Agency in South Korea for
supporting this work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be glad to try and answer any
questions.
Questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a little controversial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hugh Nimmo did an experiment that
suggested mutations in CCA1 and TAC1
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't affect the root clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have revisited that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a root clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like there is a lot of a guy
named Endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget his first name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese cell is starting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a postdoc with Steve Kay.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own lab in Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has been looking systematically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the clocks in different tissues are
functioning slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an epidermal clock and a
mesophilal clock and a vascular clock and
[SPEAKER_04]: a root clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Paloma Moss in Barcelona did a
really interesting experiment where she
[SPEAKER_04]: excised the shoot apical meristem and
discovered that the root clock stopped
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it looks like there may be some
hierarchical relationships among these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a very active area.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there is a root clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew that I didn't show you these data.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been collaborating with my wife,
Mary Lou Garineau, who's Melina's buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she studies iron homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out I would always be a pain
in the butt at every one of her student
[SPEAKER_04]: seminars and say, what time of day did you
do the experiment?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would say, shut up, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, my Korean postdoc got together
with her Korean postdoc and finally did
[SPEAKER_04]: the experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reductase that reduces the iron
and the transport of the transports the
[SPEAKER_04]: iron in, both show they're strongly iron
inducible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you only see this when you're doing it
under iron starvation conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're circadian gated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they peak dramatically at one
particular time of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, the clock is regulating iron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Iron homeostasis in the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there clearly has to be a root clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're collaborating on trying to
figure out how that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're still pretty much in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add to it, we actually had the
same experiments in roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to analyze gene expression
as opposed to proper deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that the data were all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we fixed the time of RNA
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this variation just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out this experiment has been done
over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many, many, many of my collaborators and
colleagues in the circadian field started
[SPEAKER_04]: out doing gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one postdoc couldn't reproduce the
graduate student.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one was a lark and one was an owl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they fought like cats and dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then suddenly they realized they're
both right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that has dragged a lot of people
into the clock field, kicking and
[SPEAKER_04]: screaming, typically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's a pretty related
question.
I'm just wondering which organ or tissue
are collected for detection about the
ducting, ducting-related genes,
and whether there's any difference among
[SPEAKER_03]: them to center the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you start doing laser dissection
or protoplasting and sorting, you can
[SPEAKER_04]: start seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in these epidermis, mesophyll,
vascular tissue, in the leaf, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see slightly different profiles of
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And different mutations affect different
clocks, different tissue-specific clocks
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't done any of that ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's definitely a growth industry in
the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything I've shown you and
everything I've done is a leaf lamina.
[SPEAKER_04]: So predominantly mesophyll, but with
epidermis in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we showed Todd Michael, when he was a
grad student in my lab, did some
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments where he provided light-dark
cycles or temperature cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would put them in opposition to one
another, sort of this gladiator
[SPEAKER_04]: experiment, and ask which is more
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out the answer depends on
which target you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a mesophyll express gene like CAB
responded primarily to light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But an epidermal catalase responded
primarily to temperature rather than
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's going to be a great deal of
complexity there that is only beginning to
[SPEAKER_04]: be explored.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are so many genes involved in
keeping this oscillating network going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look at QTL, you get a few
big peaks, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them are genes that you know
are involved in this, like gigantia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those QTL genes and their position in the
co-expression network, are they more
[SPEAKER_03]: connected?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they occupy transitional positions
between modules?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's informative?
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, it's big intervals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And very few of the actual genes have been
identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seth Davis has identified L3 in one
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've identified gigantia.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a different species in a population.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a good candidate for one in
Arabidopsis now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't know enough to know about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, the log scores are misleading.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because each one of those, I wish we had a
really large effect gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: But each one of these QTL, I think the
largest one we've seen is accounting for
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% or 15% of the variation in the trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are definitely not behaving like
Mendelian.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not large effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it more challenging,
but perhaps more interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've exactly articulated part of our
interest in pursuing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will that turn out to be true?
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it if it were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Susan?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said you were showing that decline
of the Monsanto soybeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do humans show a decline in clock,
such as the Icelandic population,
[SPEAKER_02]: by and large have a different kind of
clock, or have a different?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know you say we can train.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm asking whether there is a genetic
component to the clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know of any study that's been
looking geographically in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do know that there's a genetic
basis in the clock for a number of human
[SPEAKER_04]: pathologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So advanced familial sleep syndrome and
delayed familial sleep syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Underlying that are mutations in canonical
clock genes, like PERS, BMALs,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether or not there will be a clock
function thing, I don't know if we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: in those latitudes long enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a really interesting question to
explore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are starting to do this more
and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had to really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be, when I started in the
field, they thought that we all ran really
[SPEAKER_04]: quite long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the way they did the studies,
as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an artifact, because they'd take
somebody, typically a PhD student who
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to write their thesis or a
professor who wanted to write their
[SPEAKER_04]: monograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they wanted to be left alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'd volunteer for one of these cave
or bunker studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd go underground for some period
of time and write their thesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they'd open the door to let
them out, they'd say, hey, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm counting the days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another week to go here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't finished my last chapter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's because the clock was running a
little long.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they gave them control of the light
switch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that lights in the
evening delay your clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just with the presence of light in the
evening, they were actually artificially
[SPEAKER_04]: lengthening the period of their clock,
which is, of course, why you don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: do your email right before bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now to do these studies,
it's not so fun, because they strap you
[SPEAKER_04]: down in a dim room and intubate you and
put an IV in and give you 200 calories
[SPEAKER_04]: every, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our period, as much work as a species,
is much closer to 24 hours than we
[SPEAKER_04]: thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what the range is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they've done it on a lot of
people yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be really interesting to look
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why the Scandinavians are
depressive or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's because there's no sun or manic
depresso.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, I'm kind of moving into the
manic phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this time of year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that's just because it's been so
dark for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think the Hanover weather is much
like the Ithaca weather in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before thinking about the seminar,
there's an announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the student, there are openings for
lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please come see us after the seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
