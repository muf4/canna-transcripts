[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm going to be talking about
breeding for weed compatibility in naked
[SPEAKER_02]: organic barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is naked barley?
[SPEAKER_02]: Naked barley is simply barley when
harvested, the hull falls off the grain in
[SPEAKER_02]: a similar fashion to wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently breeding it in the
organic context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying to develop different
ways to evaluate it in New York state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three methods that we're doing this is
doing acre grow-outs for marketing on
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity panels and our regional yield
trials, which I'll go into more detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the big challenges associated with
growing naked organic barley with New York
[SPEAKER_02]: include food and malt standards,
disease pressure, and a lot of agronomic
[SPEAKER_02]: pressures from the New York state
environment, and especially ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant to organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One important organic condition factor is
weed competitive ability, or WCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed competitive ability is defined as an
ability for a crop to tolerate or
[SPEAKER_02]: out-compete weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a significant problem in organic
systems because obviously they don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: as much access to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition for evaluation and
experiments, it's very difficult to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at because weeds are very influenced by
the environment and crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year we went about trying to
develop methods to evaluate weed
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive ability by looking at
measurements of the weeds, by looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of weeds were in the plots,
made a visual percentage estimation,
[SPEAKER_02]: did some weed counts, and then did some
measurements on barley growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: including stand counts, early plant
height, visual barley percentage,
[SPEAKER_02]: and categorical visual vigor ratings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year I presented on this,
and overall we didn't have a high
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had a particularly rough
environment for growing barley on the 2018
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we did have some correlation for
the barley at May 16th, May 29th,
[SPEAKER_02]: we determined that visual estimates and
categorical vigor ratings are not
[SPEAKER_02]: quantitative enough to measure barley
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this project we turned to using
kind of high throughput aerial imaging
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques to quantify barley growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So aerial imaging from UAVs can measure
multispectral bands that are reflected
[SPEAKER_02]: from the barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particularly for our interest,
we're focused on the near infrared and red
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelengths and finding the differences of
those over a ratio that is known as normal
[SPEAKER_02]: differential vegetation index.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this can serve as a measurement of
vegetative biomass in a plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our aim is if we can measure this growth
and measure the rate of growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can out-compete weeds early in the
season before the weeds can become more
[SPEAKER_02]: established and then start competing with
the barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this experiment, on the field
design and management, we had two
[SPEAKER_02]: locations, Freeville and Caldwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freeville was a much more non-stressed
ideal environment for growing barley,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Caldwell location had a lot more
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 20 entities with three
replications and a randomized complete
[SPEAKER_02]: plot design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for management, Freeville was
planted April 23rd, Caldwell on April
[SPEAKER_02]: 24th, grown under organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one special thing that we did have to
do is that we did have to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds within the plots, because if we did
not, it would not be possible to
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiate the NDVI between the weeds
and the barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this field is the Caldwell one.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, there is significant
variation within this field, particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: among row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the method of aerial image
collection, flights were conducted using a
[SPEAKER_02]: make-a-sense red edge camera using a DJI
100 drone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flights were conducted 25 meters,
which gives a resolution about two
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters per pixel.
[SPEAKER_02]: For ground truth NDVI, we used a tremble
green seeker, and we used an RTK system
[SPEAKER_02]: for the four ground control points per
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timeline for the flights, we conducted
seven for each location.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started at about 30 days after planting
and ended about 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Images of the Caldwell elevation
reflectance panel were taken before and
[SPEAKER_02]: after each flight, and flights were
conducted within three hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: solubility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got about 68 to 75 image, five spectral
bands per field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used Agnesoft Pro to stitch the images
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to extract mean NDVI values,
I used image breed developed by Nick
[SPEAKER_02]: Morales on part of BreedBase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you can see some of the plot
polygons that were developed for the
[SPEAKER_02]: location of Freeville.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, for Freeville, between the
correlation of ground truth values to
[SPEAKER_02]: aerial imaging values, the correlations
were quite high at the beginning and the
[SPEAKER_02]: end, but at the middle, they were quite
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two reasons for this could be either there
is some error on my part of measuring the
[SPEAKER_02]: UAV head into VI, but in addition,
the ground truth on green seeker can only
[SPEAKER_02]: measure to two significant figures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like 0.79 to 0.80 and 0.81.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may have been not able to capture
the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in Caldwell, we had much higher
correlations, and that might be due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: contrast of the stressful environment that
provided much more accurate correlations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at Freeville, these are distributions
of the NDVI values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is the aerial imaging, and blue is
the ground truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And early in the season at Freeville,
the variation decreased early in days
[SPEAKER_02]: after planting, and then kind of decreased
and then increased again.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Caldwell, however, there was much more
uneven variation due to the stress and
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of nutrients at Caldwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I calculated heritabilities for each
time point.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Freeville, I used this model.
[SPEAKER_02]: The response is the NDVI value,
just an intercept mean and a random effect
[SPEAKER_02]: of genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, heritabilities were high,
with the exception of this time point in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Caldwell, I used this model with
the only addition is I used a fixed
[SPEAKER_02]: effector row to account for the
significant row effects I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, and heritabilities were quite a
bit higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heritabilities were a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of correlations to other traits,
yield, there's only about a 0.52
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation for the later days after
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heading date was a correlation for the
early growth, which would make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have higher vegetative growth
earlier in the season, heading date will
[SPEAKER_02]: be higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly, there is no correlation for
height.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be captured by the aerial
imaging, and there were some correlation
[SPEAKER_02]: to the diseases of spot blotch.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Caldwell, there was a significant
correlation for yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heading date, there was not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this system, the correlations were able
to capture height differences,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was some correlation to spot
blotch.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future, I hope to model this a
little bit more dynamically and utilizing
[SPEAKER_02]: growth curve functions per line across
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to work on models addressing
spatial variability in the field,
[SPEAKER_02]: hope to develop prediction models for some
of these traits, and then hopefully use
[SPEAKER_02]: these models for potential selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to thank everyone to help
me out with this, committee members,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, Gary, and Sam, everyone in the lab
group, special thanks to everyone helping
[SPEAKER_02]: me with aerial imaging, of learning how to
do that, including Margaret, Nick,
[SPEAKER_02]: all three Nicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the Yannick lab group in
synapsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Carl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if part of what you're getting after is
competitiveness of weeds, why did you
[SPEAKER_03]: choose NDVI versus looking at like plant
height or canopy coverage as your benefit?
[SPEAKER_02]: So NDVI seemed like it would be the best
way to kind of capture the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: coverage, but I realized there might be
models that might be better for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But height is something we thought we
could put in the model, but height
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't, like measured last year didn't
seem to capture that as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that, like, NDVI would
capture more of like a wide leaf angle,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, of the barleys to capture
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that there is a uniform
distribution of different types of weeds
[SPEAKER_05]: across the plots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are some differences on the
paper groups that compete differently with
[SPEAKER_05]: the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be, but it's very still,
even then, it's still very difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure because there might be weed
distributions, but yeah, they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're much more located with respect to
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like last year, you'll have a certain
corner of the field that has a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of weed, and then another that will
have another, but it's just very difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: to control for what kind of weeds on
pop-up in the certain areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, do you have notes on, so there's two
main growth habits for barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-strait, and erect, so there's some
that lie really flat on the ground for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time, and then still are,
and others that are upright the whole way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have notes on that for listening to
barleys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Dan asked if I have notes on
prostate versus erect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and currently there's only really one
line that is not erect, it's prostrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah, I do, and I didn't find a
significant difference with those either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you looked at the rate of growth
early on, so a lot of out-competing needs
[SPEAKER_04]: and competitive mobility has been linked
to rapid growth from germination?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a trait you could be looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah, hopefully next year,
I hope to aim to do this as soon as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: planted and look at even earlier stages,
but in developing this protocol is a
[SPEAKER_02]: learning process to do imaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: When should we start, when should we
finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Carl.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the nature of the stress between
the two locations, and was it intentional?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not intentional, that's what came
out of the fields, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional in that, but these are how
organic fields can be, but probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: most probable cause for the stress is
probably nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these were planted at the same
time, so it was probably nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten into that yet,
but I would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if there are no more questions
over from Zoom, please join me one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time in thanking Carl.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
