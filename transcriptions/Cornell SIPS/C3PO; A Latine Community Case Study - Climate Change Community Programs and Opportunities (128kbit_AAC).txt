[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our fourth webinar in our first
spring webinar series, and you can see our
[SPEAKER_00]: two speakers' bios in the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some quick
announcements, and then we will launch
[SPEAKER_00]: right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the National Extension Climate
Initiative, or NECI?
[SPEAKER_00]: We serve as an anchor for extension
professionals, researchers, and partners
[SPEAKER_00]: to collaborate on climate-related issues,
share resources, discuss barriers and
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for advancing climate change
programming in extension, and engage in
[SPEAKER_00]: professional development activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 100% voluntary, and so we're
encouraging you all to join one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: working groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This program is being presented by the
Curriculum Development Group, but we also
[SPEAKER_00]: have a Communications Working Group,
a Justice Equity Inclusion and Diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: Group, Professional Development Group,
Partnership and Policy Group, and an
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaluation Working Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more on
nationalextensionclimateinitiative.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, as I said, the fourth webinar,
May 22nd, Communities and Climates,
[SPEAKER_00]: on co-created materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on June 26th, we will have an event on
aging and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the recordings from past
events at the website on the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll put it in the chat later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also register for the upcoming
webinar, Aging and Climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not built out our fall webinar
series, but we hope to do so soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will let you all know about that
when that becomes final.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aspire to be a resource of many
resources from which you can draw upon in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to apply for your own regional work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're inspired, we encourage you to
join us, and you can learn more at the
[SPEAKER_00]: NECI website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you see what is happening on the
next webinar, these are our three
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers, Carl Pilmer, Danielle Aragoni,
and Leslie Wharton, are going to talk in
[SPEAKER_00]: three different valences, so to speak,
on the topic of aging and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really neat group that's coming up,
and I encourage you all to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, with that, I'm going to pass it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 3.03, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia is going to go first,
and then Melissa is going to follow,
[SPEAKER_00]: so take it away, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm going to talk about a
grant-funded program that both Melissa
[SPEAKER_01]: Cray and I work on, and we affectionately
call it C3PO, which is Climate Change
[SPEAKER_01]: Community Programs and Opportunities,
or there is a very long name right below
[SPEAKER_01]: that that our funder, National Science
Foundation, gave us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to provide an overview of
the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melissa Cray and myself, along with
Rosalyn McCann and Art Mesh, are the PIs
[SPEAKER_01]: on this project, and then I'm going to
give more details specifically on the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have done in Washington State with
the Latina and Hispanic communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this project came together in November
of 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was election season, and I had a lot of
anxiety about who was going to win the
[SPEAKER_01]: election.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bit of deja vu here with this picture,
and now that it's 2024, and once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're entering election season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the night of the election,
November 3rd, I sent out an email to Paula
[SPEAKER_01]: Chappelle and said, hey, Paula,
do you think anybody in Nucky would want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a grant with me on climate change
education?
[SPEAKER_01]: Paula said, sure, and Melissa was one of
the people that responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know Melissa at the time,
but she has been a great collaborator,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the project was funded in the summer
of 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, it's an NSF grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Advancing Informal STEM Learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The category of grant that we have,
Pilot and Feasibility Studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not on their current list of
opportunities that they are offering for
[SPEAKER_01]: their next deadline in 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's lots of things there,
and I think it's a great fit for people
[SPEAKER_01]: working on climate change education and
extension type work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been working with four different
upper underrepresented communities in
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our colleague Art Nash works with tribal
and Indigenous youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He presented in this webinar series
earlier this spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Utah, our colleague Roslyn McCann has
worked with Indigenous communities in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Melissa, who will be presenting after
me, works with women forest owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I work in Washington state with
Hispanic and Latina community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going forward, I'm just going to refer to
that as the Latina community.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the project started, when we wrote
the grant, we had this idea that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: be doing a very interactive creation of
the work that we were doing, that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a lot of time on the design of the
educational program around climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be soliciting feedback from our
advisory board, from different groups that
[SPEAKER_01]: represented the different communities we
are working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would be testing the curriculum
and the products that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These arrows represent that we were hoped
to have very much a two-way flow of
[SPEAKER_01]: information between everyone that was
working on the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I'm mainly going to focus on this
testing portion of the project and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that has worked for the past two years in
2023 and 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started this project as a team,
we came up with learning objectives that
[SPEAKER_01]: we thought that all four locations can
follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were using a curriculum based out of
University of California called Climate
[SPEAKER_01]: Stewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were each modifying and co-creating
that curriculum for our specific community
[SPEAKER_01]: in our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had not reviewed this diagram in a while
until this morning and I looked through
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really stood out to me was the
social, cultural values, perspectives,
[SPEAKER_01]: and practices of specific communities and
how you respond to climate change and how
[SPEAKER_01]: our work really needed to focus on that
and how we could not take a curriculum,
[SPEAKER_01]: make a few changes to make it state or
region specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, there were pretty
substantial changes that we made for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: fit our communities that we are working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington State, what we started with
was a very thorough needs assessment of
[SPEAKER_01]: our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did lots of focus groups and
interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: With people in the Latina community,
and I could do a whole webinar just on
[SPEAKER_01]: that portion of our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the advice that community
members gave us was to adapt how the
[SPEAKER_01]: information was presented to make it
specifically for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like things to be very active,
interactive, and fun and tangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They encourage us to do field trips and
ecological outings to show the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of caring for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recognition and awards are very
important to people in the Latina
[SPEAKER_01]: community, as well as gifts and prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then make sure that these events are
fun and providing food and music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a party than just an
educational event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the curriculum co-creation that we did,
we took input from all of the interviews,
[SPEAKER_01]: focus groups, and the needs assessment
that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with four community leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had an education consultant on
the project, as well as myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were taking the curriculum from
University of California Climate Stewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only were we integrating to make
it Washington State Pacific, but we were
[SPEAKER_01]: brainstorming on how to make this informal
learning and how to make it appealing to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Latina community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The course components, we changed a bit
from the organization that is in the UC
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate Stewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started very much with community
building and trying to encourage a
[SPEAKER_01]: community and create a community within
our course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to environmental systems
and talked about that, as well as some
[SPEAKER_01]: general ideas about climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that point, we went to more
into unit three, which was focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: local mitigation and community resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that instead of using the
term adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we finished the course with how
you talk about climate and climate
[SPEAKER_01]: communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our participants in our course,
they do a final project, which they can do
[SPEAKER_01]: as an individual or they can work in
groups in doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a Saturday morning at WSU
Everett.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that all our participants in
the course, you know, they're actively
[SPEAKER_01]: working on a Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not everybody that's going to be
dedicated enough to come to a course on
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday morning, but we did this for 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say about three fourths of our
classes were in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have maybe three that were
virtual classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all of our classes were very family
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided childcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they got there in the morning,
we had a Mexican pastry called pendulce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a sweet bread, fresh fruit,
coffee and tea to make it a very welcoming
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have it in a university building
and facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was important to connect
them to the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them and their families are welcome
at university spaces and to encourage them
[SPEAKER_01]: for their family members to be part of the
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the different activities that we have
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I want to point out is that
the University of California program is
[SPEAKER_01]: called Climate Stewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does not translate as well into
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we use the term Promotores del
Clima, which translates to climate
[SPEAKER_01]: ambassadors for this section of the
program that I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be using Promotores del Clima or
just Promotores going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one aspect of the course was to have
people that were the lead instructors and
[SPEAKER_01]: the guest speakers in the course to be
members of the Latina community,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be fully bilingual in English and
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Cristina Ocana Gallegos,
she's my friend and colleague here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a fabulous lead instructor.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also helped with the co-creation of
the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she has been involved for a very
long time in creating this Promotores del
[SPEAKER_01]: Clima.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were able to find six
different guest speakers to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: different aspects of the work that they do
on climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maria is from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to work for California Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's now with a nonprofit in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isabel used to work at University of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have collaborated with Isabel for
probably six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now she's a great colleague to collaborate
with and that she was able to introduce me
[SPEAKER_01]: to McGill from Earth Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Garcia Perez is a professor at WSU and
a colleague of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dr. Ernesto Alvarado is a
professor at University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in reading the newspaper,
a local newspaper, Cristina learned about
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Jesus Perez Linares, who's a science
teacher and does a bilingual course for
[SPEAKER_01]: his class rooms in Burlington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were really critical to be
able to find this diverse array of people
[SPEAKER_01]: to give their time to speak and answer the
students' questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was very inspirational to them
to see members of their community being
[SPEAKER_01]: professors and working for these
organizations across the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we generally appreciated their
contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what we did in this course is
that we tried to make it very interactive
[SPEAKER_01]: and to bring fun into the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the climate stewards curriculum,
there's several metaphors that are used
[SPEAKER_01]: that talk about climate change and several
of those translated well into Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in the course, we talked about the
effect of greenhouse gases in our
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere being a heat trapping blanket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on the left of your screen is my
friend and colleague, Tatiana Heraldo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was involved in doing all of the
interviews and focus groups and helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by showing the greenhouse effect
and having each blanket represent a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse gas, you start with one blanket
and then you add another and another and
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, our volunteer for this
process has six blankets on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're feeling a little warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very visual representation of
what is happening to the Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing we do to illustrate another
one of the metaphors, which is regular
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon cycles versus a rampant carbon
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we start is with these green
tennis balls and we show how the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle works when there are no fossil fuels
in the equation and how it changes going
[SPEAKER_01]: through throughout the year, how it goes
up in the summer and then down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter in the northern hemisphere and then
the opposite in the southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take the cycle and we
integrate gray tennis balls, which
[SPEAKER_01]: represent coal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We integrate black tennis balls,
which represent petroleum and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: does to the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we either have a box or a bucket
or something and that represents the Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and the atmosphere of Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we integrate these, all these
different tennis balls, at some point you
[SPEAKER_01]: can easily see that it is overflowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so very visual representation of what
is happening with the carbon cycle and how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's totally out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you make it visual, it's easier
to see and easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did part of this activity in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have now given myself a challenge that
I'm going to learn to be able to lead this
[SPEAKER_01]: entire activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Spanish by the next time I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of team activities and that
was one thing our participants loved doing
[SPEAKER_01]: was working in groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an assignment early in the course
where they had to do a concept map about
[SPEAKER_01]: community connections on this side of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This group was thinking more globally in
terms of the community and the global
[SPEAKER_01]: community that we all live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture on the right, that person is
thinking, that group is thinking more
[SPEAKER_01]: locally in terms of what's the impact of
all our urban communities and forests here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing was that in both
classes that we've done, we're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of completing our second,
is that we've had talented members of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community that are good artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a way to integrate their
skills and their information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some of the courses we did virtual
and part of what we realized that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: to do in this class was that some of our
participants were not familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to spend time helping them
learn technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use Qualtrics for course
registration, but we also use that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: way for them to provide us feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: After every class and then also to submit
their homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original climate stewards curriculum
is designed to be on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just wasn't going to work for our
community to use that much technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have some zoom meetings and within
that, you know, they were able to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about breakout rooms and how to use chat,
how to use jam boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also worked in Google Classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do that in the first year,
but we've used that in the second year and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worked well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another online learning technique
we've used is Pear Deck Learning Platform,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an interactive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year, it did not work quite as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we realized is that we needed to
walk through the program and the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: with our participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got much better results and
interaction by doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to just letting them do that
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We integrated field trips into the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year we had three, the second
year we've had two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from in spring 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to the Northwest Streams
dinner, a very family friendly place where
[SPEAKER_01]: we toured the restoration project that
they had there and learned a lot about the
[SPEAKER_01]: water cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learned a lot about forests and how
forests are important to carbon storage
[SPEAKER_01]: and important to maintaining the water
quality here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more most recently, we went to a
low tide beach exploration and did that on
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was May 11th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful day to be at the beach
to observe the low tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that happened during that
event, and I don't think any of our
[SPEAKER_01]: participants are going to forget this,
is quite a ways from shore, we came across
[SPEAKER_01]: this concrete structure that was kind of
like a grid and it had pools of water in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of marine organisms
in these pools of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of starfish, sea stars, a lot of
cucumbers, a couple of fish in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just full of marine life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see in the distance,
way back here is a shoreline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our leader on this field tour felt that
it was going to be hours before high tide
[SPEAKER_01]: had reached, would reach this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she also thought that this was not
natural, that these organisms were
[SPEAKER_01]: probably placed there by somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up transporting them back
to safe places closer to the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: water's edge and hope that some of them
would survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also quite a warm day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was also illustrated in the stress
of having higher temperatures and how
[SPEAKER_01]: global climate change is going to be
affecting our marine life during low tide
[SPEAKER_01]: events when you have abnormally warm
summer days, which we had during the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: dome in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of the course, the promotors do a
final project.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the climate stewards curriculum,
it's called a capstone project,
[SPEAKER_01]: but final project is a terminology that is
better for our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, they did a wide variety of
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked individually where they work
some in groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: This participant on here had a background
in health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she did a booklet specifically on
climate change and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So salud is the word for health in
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one did a video on fashion and
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And others specifically worked on
recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very much interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another participant did specifically on
women in science and the environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: made kind of a little booklet on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also had a participant that,
Total Por Tierra, Everything for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth, that was a small book that was for
children on how to learn climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: that was beautifully illustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite exciting to see their final
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current group that we have now,
they are working on their final projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the course, we ask all our
participants why they were participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from 2023, their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had 24 that responded to the
survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of them are wanting to
learn about solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're wanting to learn more about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're wanting to learn more about
climate science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two most popular answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to select all that they
felt were relevant in the survey
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other top categories were to meet
others that had similar interests and then
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn more about community resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our graduation class from 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here at WSU Everett.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their certificates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see they're all pretty darn happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my colleague Christina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one thing that's easy for me to
point out in this photo is this is very
[SPEAKER_01]: much a family center program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can see my arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lorena and Luis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a married couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over here, we have another married
couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their children are also part of
this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their son, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over on the right, we've got another
married couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's one of their sons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think their other son is over here
on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother-daughter pairs, siblings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just exciting that they bring the
whole family to learn about climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they are thinking about this as a
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our speakers that I mentioned
earlier this year, they brought their
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, brought their spouses with them
when they came to present at the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so family is so important to this
community and designing the work that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do to make it very family-friendly and
appealing to all ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our promotores last year were
selected to be interns over the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went to a couple of different fairs
and carnivals and they had what we call a
[SPEAKER_01]: climate wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people at the festival would spin that
and then they get a question about climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change and they'd answer three questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got them all right with some
guidance with the person that was manning
[SPEAKER_01]: the booth, they get a small prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on the bottom, these are like compost
bins that we were giving out as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the fall in 2023, we had a climate
carnival where we specifically had lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different tables and booths with different
types of activities for them to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about climate change in a very interactive
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part that we did in our class where
we did the heat trapping blanket and
[SPEAKER_01]: showed the different blankets and how that
mimics what's happening to the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is one of the activities that we
demonstrated during the climate carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the feedback that we got from
our promotores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read this in Spanish and then I'll
say briefly what they translate to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is thank you for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the best experiences that
has happened to me in the past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for educating us about this
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so appreciated that we were
doing this for them, that we're making
[SPEAKER_01]: information available in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I will hammer home on is that it
is not enough just to translate
[SPEAKER_01]: information to another language.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to directly engage with that
community to help them learn, to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them, to work with them, to understand,
be involved and co-create the learning
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people reading is not their thing and
they're not going to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was at a conference last week and
someone who said to me, who's from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Latina community, you know, printing a
bunch of translated materials is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: waste of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to interact, you need to
engage and you need to make it hands-on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the impacts from a promotores
2023 class.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 23 promotores del Clina graduates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight of them were selected to be interns
in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had over direct conversations with
over 300 community members.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in Snohomish County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe we really raised the
awareness about climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need to do is talk more about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look over here on the right of the
screen, you can see that the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they shifted their opinion from
before the course to after the course and
[SPEAKER_01]: their thoughts about, you know,
what we need to do about climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: and their feelings of empowerment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes time to build these
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been working on different
educational programs with the Latina
[SPEAKER_01]: community for about eight years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's taken that much time
to make it so that I am a respected member
[SPEAKER_01]: of the community that knows that I'm not
going to just disappear when the funding's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone and only going to show up again when
I have another project that I want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make things intergenerational
so that it appeals to teens, to
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparents is what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be fun, engaging and
interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I've noticed is talking
about climate change, it can be extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with this group, it seems lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having these hard conversations,
but there seems to be more optimism,
[SPEAKER_01]: more empowerment that we can actually do
something about this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Christina here in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Leonore, who does child care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Melina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melina is in Spain currently learning to
be bilingual in Spanish and English.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now her mom's helping me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just another idea of how the family
sticks together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the extreme number of people that
have helped with this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably leaving somebody off this
list, but we had over a dozen people on
[SPEAKER_01]: the C3PO team that we were meeting
monthly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an advisory board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the advisory board were people
that responded to that email blast I sent
[SPEAKER_01]: out on election day in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we each had different partners
that worked with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's my contact information and I'll
leave it up to Jenny if there's time for
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is one question in the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has any other questions,
please type them into the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we can allow you to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you would respond to the question,
do you see it, Patricia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I read it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for your sharing this
exciting collaborative work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you specifically or generally define
community through your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wondering about the possibilities of
directly empowering more than human
[SPEAKER_01]: elements within your program.
[SPEAKER_01]: E.g.
[SPEAKER_01]: person to person, equal person to nature
connectivity pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for such important exciting work
regarding family driven work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Person to nature connectivity pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very interesting question,
Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that we really did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one hard part about this is the
Spanish speaking community that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching to, they are extremely diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of their life experiences,
how they ended up in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: the countries that they come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of that is just, it's a lot to
handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is a great idea for
future work and I appreciate your
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know one of the initial surveys that
I'm getting about directly with this
[SPEAKER_01]: course is the Marine field trip that we
did just a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just people don't think about,
you can go to the beach during low tide
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can see all these cool,
amazing things and learn about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about the beach is like sand and
sun and fun and games.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so many things that you can
open the world to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sharon, there's another great question
from Sharon in the Q&A, but I really do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to move us on to Melissa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Patricia, if you could respond next,
because it's a great question,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon, and we can maybe verbalize it at
the end if there's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia, do you want to just respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had one question from Sharon just so
verbally everybody can hear in case they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a question about how you get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the right one, Jenny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at one point at Washington State in
Extension, we had a person, fabulous
[SPEAKER_01]: colleague of mine, friend who passed away
too soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a Latino man and that was his
job, was to engage with the Latino
[SPEAKER_01]: community throughout Washington State and
to do economic community development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was based in our office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was just a fabulous,
motivator to get this started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though he's no longer with us,
I see his work living in through me and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the people I'm reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just finding one person within the
community that you can make a connection
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was through him that he offered
advice and gave us introduction to this
[SPEAKER_01]: organization, Letty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to their fundraisers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever they ask me to write a letter for
a grant they're applying for, I make time
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make them just a priority in the
work that I'm doing and I will for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you build and sustain those
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes time and investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
