[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are logged on to the first of 12 Berry
Soil and Nutrient Management webinars,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are sponsored by the Northeast
Sustainable Research and Education
[SPEAKER_01]: Program, SARE, and they're hosted by the
Cornell University Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Horticulture and Cornell University
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Laura McDermott, and today I am
acting as the moderator for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, in place of Kathy Heidenreich,
who is going to be the speaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just helping her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can start now with the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you a brief little tour
in case you haven't joined us for an Adobe
[SPEAKER_01]: Connect webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of features that may be
slightly different than other webinars
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've attended.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the lower left corner is the links.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually link directly to these
different websites from this webinar page.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are recording this entire classroom,
so if you have questions or the
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction that you're giving of
yourself here in the chat box,
[SPEAKER_01]: those will be recorded for future viewing
for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly you can talk to one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a private comment that is not
pertinent, perhaps, to the webinar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually make that comment by
going over to the top right of the chat
[SPEAKER_01]: box and kind of select people to chat
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably most of your chats will be
pertinent, though, and we do hope that you
[SPEAKER_01]: write your comments and questions into the
chat box so they'll be recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's right down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That long bar underneath is where you type
into and then hit the little balloon icon
[SPEAKER_01]: and that sends it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some files.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower right hand corner of the digital
classroom, there are some files that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can download to your own computer and
you're invited to do that at any point
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the beginning of the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the notes, the agenda,
and other things are in this bar on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pod that's on the right hand side of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, Kathy, I'm hoping that you might
be able to help me or give me an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to do the pre-test poll
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, is that a yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, Kathy, that you would like me to
pull these pods on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm gonna go ahead and we've got
some poll questions for people to view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go ahead and answer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should and everyone who's logged
on should answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, this is not like an SAT
where you make your best guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really don't know, then please just
say don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all of the questions, that would be
really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Hillary, you had a question about
how to submit your answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go ahead and click it and it will
automatically submit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had over 60 people sign on for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got quite a large group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we still have a few more
people that need to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm encouraging you to do that because
this is part of the beginning kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold knowledge level that we'll be
keeping track of as we go forward for the
[SPEAKER_01]: grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are still on question one,
Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess most people can have voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to close this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that alright, Kathy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and close this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go to the second poll pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changes in soil pH by adding sulfur or
lime generally take effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know, please again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will make the pod wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got most everybody has
voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll close that pod now and open the
second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, folks, for bearing
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do need to do these polls as part
of the kind of testing your knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best form of nitrogen to apply to
blueberries is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if you don't know, please admit
that and don't guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think we have about everybody
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a fair amount of questions,
so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberries often display nutrient
deficiency or excess symptoms in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: True, false, don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on number five.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries should be fertilized in
spring before the berry set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I think most people have answered
question five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll move on to question six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Optimum soil organic matter content for
berry crops is less than 3%, greater than
[SPEAKER_01]: 3% soil organic matter is not a critical
factor in berry crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know or no vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go on to
[SPEAKER_01]: question number seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best soil for strawberry production is
a well-drained sandy loam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we still got it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try to close that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this is question number eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil tests attempt to estimate the amount
of plant available nutrients in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the total amount of nutrients in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this true or false, or if you don't
know, just let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think that's everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, this is a little cumbersome when
I'm opening these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clays and soils high in organic matter
have higher nutrient holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: while sands have a lower nutrient holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: True or false?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think we have everybody there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I think I opened the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, getting a little...
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrient levels in berry plant tissue will
always mirror nutrient levels found in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, true or false?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thanks for bearing with us,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just something that we need to do
in order to get a pretest level of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your levels of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think we've got everybody
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this is question eleven.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommended pH for bramble plantings,
raspberries and blackberries is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just choose there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for those of you who came out a
little bit later, don't guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, just put don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is rare for a single foliar nutrient to
be deficient in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often multiple deficiencies occur
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think we've got everybody's
vote there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best time to collect berry leaves for
foliar analysis is...
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think we have everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was thirteen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're on fourteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil tests provide accurate results for
all essential mineral nutrients while
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar analysis does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: True or false?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're on question fifteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, Kathy, I hope you're keeping track of
me because I'm losing track of which
[SPEAKER_01]: question we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visual diagnosis of berry crop nutrient
problems is accurate and precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: True or false?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fifteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting very close, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommended pH levels for strawberry is
4.2 to 4.5, 5.5 to 6.0, 6.0 to 6.5,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 6.5 to 7.0, or don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a perfectly legitimate answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think we have everyone there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go on to question seventeen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question seventeen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A combination of soil testing,
tissue analysis, and observation of crop
[SPEAKER_01]: response is the best approach to assessing
berry crop nutrient status.
[SPEAKER_01]: True, false, or don't know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move to question eighteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil health may be improved by frequent
cultivation to improve soil drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: True or false, or don't know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you all for voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have two more pods left,
two more pole pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question nineteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Characteristics of a healthy soil include
good soil tilth, sufficient depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: an excessive supply of nutrients,
a small population of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: or don't know, and you can check all that
apply, all that are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be trickier for me to see if
everyone has voted because we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple answers, but when they stop
ticking up, that's when we'll close this
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll go to the last poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the last pretest question,
soil and leaf samples for testing should
[SPEAKER_01]: be collected in a V-shaped sampling
pattern across the entire planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say true, false, or don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I think everyone has voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for hanging in there with us
for that pretest group of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to point out, one way that you
can, you can always try to get our
[SPEAKER_01]: attention through the chat box or you can,
on the top bar there's a little icon with
[SPEAKER_01]: a hand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can raise your hand and we'll try to
make sure that we address whatever your
[SPEAKER_01]: question is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to move us now into the
next segment, which is the presentation
[SPEAKER_01]: segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And introduce Cathy Heidenreich to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can remember how to do that,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to introduce Cathy
Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you know Cathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the Cornell University Berry
Extension Support Specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was my partner in crime when we were
doing a New York Farm Viability Berry
[SPEAKER_01]: Project and she's a really great person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very dedicated to berry education and she
is standing in for Dr. Marvin Pritz,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is currently flying back from the ASHS
meetings in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cathy will probably be the moderator
for many of the webinars upcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's going to take over the
introductory part and Cathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology is great when it works,
but all during the quiz my audio was not
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry I couldn't help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody, hopefully everybody
will be able to hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thank you everyone for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually was one of the first
successful grant proposals that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: written and I'm really, really happy with
the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 66 people registered already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have other colleagues who would be
interested in participating, it's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: late for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more than welcome to attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed the pre-test or if you
haven't filled out the registration form,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get to the end, you'll be able to
download those in the last screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: please feel free to email those to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I just want to give you an
overview of the project and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start I think with the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil Management and Berry Crops as a Model
for Management Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hope was while providing
information on berry crops in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil nutrient management, that the
information that you'll learn and the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that will become available to
you will also be applicable across a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're very excited about this and
very happy that you've joined us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to take a quick look
at the project itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several issues that we
identified in the course of the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done for Dr. Marvin Pritz at Cornell
and one of them is that commercial berry
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in the Northeast traditionally
have applied fertilizer based on crop age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the crops are less than a year old,
no application in that particular year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're one year old or two years old,
a certain poundage of fertilizer is
[SPEAKER_00]: applied and then as they increase in age
that number probably goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this practice is still very popular
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some 10 years or more after commercial
berry crop guidelines have shifted to an
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis based fertilization program and
the testing has become very good and
[SPEAKER_00]: widely available at very reasonable cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other issue is that because
berry crops are by nature perennial crop
[SPEAKER_00]: system, adoption of soil health,
improving practices has also been slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the Ag educator multiplier end of
it, on your end of it, we discovered that
[SPEAKER_00]: although you're frequently called on to
cover multiple commodities or information
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, they often fall outside of your
field of expertise and so it's a struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: to assist commercial berry growers with
their soil nutrient problems and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no single comprehensive resource for this
topic that's available either for you as
[SPEAKER_00]: educators or for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an issue that Dr. Pritz and I
discussed quite frequently and decided we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to try to address and we want to
thank Northeast SARE for funding this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two year project and we're
hoping to provide in depth berry crop soil
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient management training and resources
for you and in turn you can use these to
[SPEAKER_00]: assist commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first year of the plan,
we're going to try to help you build some
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise and the webinar series is the
first phase of that plan and we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have some case study learning
modules on the subject for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we're also developing
resources to be used by you in grower
[SPEAKER_00]: training and so I'll be sending out to you
at some point in the next week or two the
[SPEAKER_00]: link to a beta website that we would like
you to look at and use and review and we
[SPEAKER_00]: would like your input on how we can make
that the best resource possible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: job at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in year two of the project,
we're hoping that some of you will develop
[SPEAKER_00]: and implement grower training and we're
willing to assist you with that and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll participate some growers to do soil
and nutrient testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the Northeast region,
we do have funds available through the
[SPEAKER_00]: grant for 50 growers to receive
complimentary soil and nutrient testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outside the Northeast region,
there may be some other options and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to discuss that with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping that two to three growers
per training event will be participating
[SPEAKER_00]: in testing and then implementing at least
on a portion of their planting an
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis-based fertilization program and
then we're asking that you might carry out
[SPEAKER_00]: one-on-one consultations with
participating growers to discuss results
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd like to capture those results and
their feedback on it to use to help
[SPEAKER_00]: convince other growers hopefully to do the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to share a little bit
with you about the team members and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man in the purple shirt on the right
is Dr. Marvin Pritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the professor and chair of the
horticulture department at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University and he sends his apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot to include the time change and
he thought he would be back in time to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this presentation and unfortunately,
he's still in the air somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his expertise is buried crop
production and in specific, soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be the project
coordinator for the project and I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: in the department of horticulture at
Cornell and my expertise is in buried crop
[SPEAKER_00]: production and pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a multidisciplinary project and
we're very happy that Dr. Harold Van Ness
[SPEAKER_00]: has agreed to collaborate with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's professor and chair of the department
of crop and soil sciences at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: His expertise is soil and water management
and this is a picture of Harold down under
[SPEAKER_00]: in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob Schindlbeck is also a collaborator
from the same department.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works very closely with Harold in the
soil health testing project that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at Cornell University and his
expertise is soil health testing and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four other team members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Jeff Miller is one of our team members
he's from Oneida County Cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the agriculture issue leader there
and his expertise is in agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dan Welch is also a member of our
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a extension resource educator with
Cayuga County Cooperative Extension and
[SPEAKER_00]: his field of expertise is farm business
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be tracking the economic of
nutrient management for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have a comparison between a
calendar based crop age fertilization plan
[SPEAKER_00]: and plans based on test analysis results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mario Moran de Sazo is another of our team
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the tree fruit and berry fruit
extension specialist with the Lake Ontario
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit team and his expertise is cultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've already met Laura McDermott our
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a regional specialist with the
capital district vegetable and fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: program with Cornell Cooperative Extension
and her expertise is blank so I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize for that Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her expertise is in vegetable and berries,
small fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also has tree fruit experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a little look at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were very kind to fill out the
demographics survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who have not you'll be able
to download it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send that back to me by email.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before there are 66 of you and
you're spread across the country and into
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people from Illinois,
Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Hampshire, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming, West Virginia and Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty-eight of you are associated with a
college or university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve are associated with a government
agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty involved in extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight are associated with USDA and RCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of you work with organic production
or organic producers and seven are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with other enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way I didn't include the
demographics in terms of age but I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that we all fall in that mid-career
category so we need to be recruiting some
[SPEAKER_00]: younger people to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of occupation there were many
extension and ag educators, professors,
[SPEAKER_00]: instructors, soil conservationists,
agronomists and planners, consultants,
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture research, IPM and extension
specialists, scientists, district managers
[SPEAKER_00]: and conservationists, technical advisors,
program coordinators, water stewardship
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil conservation technicians,
outreach coordinators, program leaders,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental biologists and engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apart from the professional expertise
fields that I listed on the demographic
[SPEAKER_00]: survey we have people who are in
environmental compliance, consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture, conservation technology,
plant pathology, sustainable agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy, land protection, pesticide
education, soil management and best
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to measure the success
of the project?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already taken one step toward that
in the pretest that you all participated
[SPEAKER_00]: in and I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to warn you there'll be another
test at the end to measure the expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been gained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then throughout the project and in
subsequent years we're going to monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: the adoption and success of analysis-based
berry crop nutrient and soil management by
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial growers who participate in
the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our final goal then is to have 50
educators participate in the training to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand their expertise and of those that
15 will develop and deliver some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: an outreach program on the same to 150
berry growers who manage approximately 750
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're hoping that 50 of those
growers will participate in preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: soil nutrient and or soil health testing
and then receive one-on-one assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: with the interpretation of the results and
then implement that on farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are no more questions I think we
can move into the final just the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the exit and make sure please to notice
that there are the links that you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in checking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all these intro files and Kathy
apparently my little cursor was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: showing so people could actually see what
I was voting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see where my challenges lie in
my responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you, were there post poll
questions for this segment or is that at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very end?
[SPEAKER_01]: No Laura, that's going to be at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to make sure that everybody
knows that next week, a week from today at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time our topic will be
introduction to soil management and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be talking about soil types, accessing
soil surveys, physical properties of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That webinar will be led by Dr. Harold Van
Ness and I think that that's it for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy, I probably have forgotten something
so please jump in if I have forgotten
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to point out that all of
these webinars are being recorded and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to view them if you miss
one or review them by going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look in the links box on the
bottom left of your screen you'll see soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrient management webinar archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that and then the browse
to button it will take you to that page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to have these posted by Monday or
Tuesday of the week following the webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't share that link with anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beta website right now and once all
of the webinars are completed and recorded
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone will have public access to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully now that everyone knows the
targets and understands what we are hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe people will start formulating in
your head how you can use this information
[SPEAKER_01]: to do outreach if that's part of your job
description.
