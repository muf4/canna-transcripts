[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the previous speakers,
they gave a nice overview of how animal
[SPEAKER_02]: science and plant science have worked
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the concepts from one field
were used in another field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this cross-disciplinary learning was
really important in driving the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and as well as animal breeding in
the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you some personal example of how
this cross-disciplinary learning have
[SPEAKER_02]: helped us answer some of the complex
questions in field phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example from our lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started in 2014 with the UAV
phenotyping project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined Jesse's program in genetics 2014
and right about that time we were starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to explore UAV phenotyping and how we can
use this phenotyping in breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got involved in that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had people from engineering department,
Kevin Wong, he was a postdoc in bio-ag
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering and Dale Shinstock,
he was a mechanical engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started a UAV testing program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started flying UAVs, testing new
platforms to see which of the platform
[SPEAKER_02]: fits well with our goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of testing and crashing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good thing is it was a cheap UAV
so we could afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the arms and legs were like very cheap
so we could replace them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of learning in 2014 and in 2015
we had people from geography and
[SPEAKER_02]: bioinformatics joining in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really helped us move ahead with
learning some other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we narrowed down to sensors,
what kind of sensors we can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we picked one or two sensors that were
really working well with our program and
[SPEAKER_02]: we made a lot of progress in analyzing
this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016 we had a aviation engineer joining
our team and he really helped us collect a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of data in the field and really ease
my work because I was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: flights and the genetics was, which is my
core field, I totally was behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he really helped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I started focusing on the genetics
and using some of these data sets that we
[SPEAKER_02]: generated using these new tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: To new platforms and sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really to highlight how
cross-disciplinary teams can really bring
[SPEAKER_02]: in new learning and how we can use these
approaches to answer some of the complex
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ultimately like this cross-disciplinary
approach and all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our main goal in plant science is to
connect genome to phenome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very crucial link if you want
to improve the crop productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have to address the
phenotyping bottleneck at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this high throughput phenotyping can
really help us to understand this
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype to phenotype link.
[SPEAKER_02]: This HTTP can allow us to rapidly and
accurately measure traits and especially
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field which is really a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can test a large number of plots in
the field which can really help us study
[SPEAKER_02]: these complex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the traits which are really hard
to measure and I'll give you an example
[SPEAKER_02]: today of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of what we are doing in
the lab and some of the studies that came
[SPEAKER_02]: out from our lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a few studies showing how this new
HTTP tools can be used in large breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really one of the cool things about UAV
phenotyping is that we can view this trait
[SPEAKER_02]: in a dynamic way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can measure these phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take these measurements upon
measurements multiple times during the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allows us to look at the trait in
a dynamic way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can really see how the things change
over time during the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rather than just looking at a single
point, we can think of it as a dynamic
[SPEAKER_02]: trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So UAS for lodging assessment in wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'll be talking about mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lodging, this is how it looks from the
sky with the drone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are large plots and there are plots
that are just unaffected by lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought initially like when we saw
these images, I was collecting data
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly for height and DBI and other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw these images and then I,
Jesse and I, we talked and we thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: can we quantify this lodging using these
image based approaches?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lodging is a permanent displacement of
plant stand from its upright position.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can have a severe impact on yield and
quality in wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lodging assessment in field is very
laborious and it's subjective in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this limits our population size for
genetic studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this limits how many plots we can study
in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really the driving force for
us to use high throughput phenotyping so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can really address this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the study objective was really to
develop a UAS based lodging assessment
[SPEAKER_02]: approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really to see how we can use these
image based approaches to quantify lodging
[SPEAKER_02]: at the field scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also to come up with the proof of
concept, how we can use these phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the image based assessments to study the
genetic architecture of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our field setup was, so these are yield
trials, cement yield trials in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this experiment going on in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically, I was already taking data as
I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did was I basically picked two
dates, pre-lodging date and post-lodging
[SPEAKER_02]: date and generated a digital elevation
model from these dates in both years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had close to 600 entries in both
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also at the same time, I collected
ground truth data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to compare how these image based
approaches that I'm gonna test on do
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the visual measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the approach that I used was based on
digital elevation models.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a pre-lodging digital elevation
model, subtracted it from a post-lodging
[SPEAKER_02]: digital elevation model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really to get a differential DEM,
which is a change in elevation over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two time points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then use this differential DEM in each
plot to really come up with two different
[SPEAKER_02]: indices.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is very simple index, which I call
differential lodging mean or DL mean or
[SPEAKER_02]: digital lodging mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is basically just taking the
average of all the differential points
[SPEAKER_02]: within a plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first index.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second index is a DL mixture I call.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is based on a more informed normal
mixture distribution based index.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of how the DL mix is
calculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically we have, this is an example
from single plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two normal distributions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One corresponds to the non-logical lodged
part and another one is a lodged part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically estimated the parameters
of each distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came up with a lodging index multiplying
these two parameters from the lodged part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I have two digital lodging indices
and three ground truth measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took a lodging incidence,
which is a severity zero to 100% lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, this is an incidence and then
severity is on a scale of zero to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of the plot is, so the first one
is how much of the plot is the plot area
[SPEAKER_02]: is lodged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second one is how severe is the lodging on
the scale of zero to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I also combined lodging index and
the lodging severity to see how this
[SPEAKER_02]: compares.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we explored phenotypic relationships on
the diagonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the first three are the visual
traits, visual assessments of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last two are the DL mean and DL mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the parentheses, these are the
broad sense heritabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had comparable heritabilities,
broad sense heritabilities and very high
[SPEAKER_02]: correlations among the visual and the
digital assessments of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our image based assessments were
working at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also looked into the genetic
correlations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So genetic correlations were also very
high in both years above 0.9, so which was
[SPEAKER_02]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had evidence that what we are
measuring is actually this lodging and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're measuring the same phenotypic
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we had these validation results,
we wanted to look into the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: architecture and see how we can use some
of these approaches in understanding the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic architecture of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2016, this is a Manhattan plot from
2016, first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no significant market rate
associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2017, however, there was a peak at
chromosome 2A.
[SPEAKER_02]: This peak corresponded to translocation
segment, which is a translocation segment
[SPEAKER_02]: from Agilob's ventricosa, which is a wild
ancestral weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This 2NS segment is involved in a lot of,
so it has been extensively used in
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding programs, historically,
because it has a lot of disease resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this peak was really consistent across
all measures of lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a good thing to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But an interesting thing was that the stop
markers only explained up to 2% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the variation was very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The variation explained by these markers
was really low, suggesting that this could
[SPEAKER_02]: be a really complex trade and trade with a
diffuse architecture with large number of
[SPEAKER_02]: small effect loci.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to explore that hypothesis of diffuse
architecture, we generated a K-fold
[SPEAKER_02]: genomic predictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to look how if we can explain
some of this unexplained variation through
[SPEAKER_02]: cold genome prediction models.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is a comparison in two years,
2016 and 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a prediction accuracy and then
prediction accuracy scale to the square
[SPEAKER_02]: root of heritability to see how,
to show how the proportion of heritable
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic variation that is explained by the
prediction accuracies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to explain up to 53% of
the heritable genetic variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also tested it across environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cross-environmental prediction
accuracies were also high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are comparing the prediction
accuracy, phenotypic correlations and
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic correlations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the data from Ludhiana location where I
collected UAV drone data, I used as a
[SPEAKER_02]: training set to predict the lodging at
another location in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had a lodging in the index values
that they collected in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to compare it across
environments also.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results were also encouraging across
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were, so this was another validation
of, and another proof of how we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these UAV based traits to look
into the genetics of complex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were also wondering if we can
establish a relationship of lodging with
[SPEAKER_02]: the agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the interesting things we saw was
with the correlation of lodging with grain
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2016, so this is a result from 2016,
the correlation was negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: The relationship is opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have higher lodging, lower yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2017, however, was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The relationship got reversed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have lines that are high yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are more prone to lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either of these cases can happen in the
field, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some years you can have lodging at a
stage where lodging happens earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it leads to yield losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other cases, you have lodging when a
crop is already headed and it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes the high yielding plants more
lodging prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just quickly the take home point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I've provided some evidence
of the scalable assessment of lodging on
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of field plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to do that in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This field-based high throughput
phenotyping can be used to study complex
[SPEAKER_02]: traits in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that, so not only just study,
we have other examples from other studies
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can use some of these new tools
to study the complex traits in feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So genomic predictions can adequately
explain the heritable genetic variation
[SPEAKER_02]: for complex traits, traits with complex
genetic architecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital lodging can be integrated with the
current breeding and prediction pipelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of breeding programs have started
using this UAV-based approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a new trait from this study,
they can easily incorporate these new
[SPEAKER_02]: tools into their breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: UAV programs can really benefit from the
predictions and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, thanks to my advisor,
Dr. Jesse Poland at Kansas State
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a great team at Poland Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have great collaborators at
Borlaug Institute for South Asia and
[SPEAKER_02]: India.
[SPEAKER_02]: CIMIT Mexico has been a good, big support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ravi Singh's program on wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have CIMIT Pakistan, our collaborator,
Mohammed Imtiaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were a great asset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was terrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can open it up to questions now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far off of the center line of those
plots did you have to fly in order to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that height measurement?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're flying directly over,
you can't see the height, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we plan our flights, we have a 70,
80% overlap between the images.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we make sure that we have this 70,
80% side and forward overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically using this overlap,
we can create a 3D model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 3D points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we could get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this height was extracted using the Z
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have X, Y, and then the 3D.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3D model, you can have a Z value.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Z value is your height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you can do height,
and lodging is an extension of height.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the, did it lodge because
it was super weak, and thus that'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: low-yielding, or because it was too
powerful for its own good?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many time points did you do the
flyovers and have the digital elevation
[SPEAKER_03]: models for?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times a year did you do the
flyover that you could get the digital
[SPEAKER_03]: elevation models?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you did it at three time
points, you would?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, I have more time points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mean different days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you did it once early in the
season and late in the season and saw
[SPEAKER_03]: which one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so the thing is sometimes your
plots, they get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these points were chosen based on when
I took the visual observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the visual field observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just picked those two dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the temporal different
days, you can see sometimes the plots can
[SPEAKER_02]: get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just really, maybe this is something
that can be looked at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlodges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's not always 100%,
but if it's on the scale of one to 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 being fully lodged, it can come back to
like seven or six or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that changes with time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, yeah, we can map that trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any questions on the Zoom?
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, we can say thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
