[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're logged into the second of 12 Berry
Soil and Nutrient Management webinars
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by Northeast Sustainable
Research and Education Program and hosted
[SPEAKER_00]: by Cornell University Department of
Horticulture and Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jeff Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling you right now from Oneida
County, Central New York, and I'll be your
[SPEAKER_00]: moderator for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be starting promptly at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern Standard Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to direct you to the pieces of
what you're viewing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off to the left is the list of attendees,
and you can see from the comments in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat box in the lower middle that there
are people from Penn State joining us,
[SPEAKER_00]: UMass, people from New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a good collection of people
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look to the lower left,
you'll see a series of web links.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the Soil and Nutrient Management
webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you'll find a lot of
information about what's being presented
[SPEAKER_00]: today and in future events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below it is a publication,
Building Soils for Better Crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll direct you to the far right,
where there's a file box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't joined us before,
this is the second meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would download the demographics and
the educator pre-tests at your leisure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that after this program today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would fill them out and then
send them into Kathy Heidenrich,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she's, her address is on those pieces,
and send them in to her, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: very helpful to fulfill our requirements
for the grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take questions
throughout the program, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer the questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm going to switch over and
introduce our speaker today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our speaker is Harold Van Ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Professor of Soil and Water
Management, Chair of the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop and Soil Sciences at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: His current research and extension
interests are in precision management of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, soil health, and space-time
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold teaches an undergrad course in soil
management for sustainability and a grad
[SPEAKER_00]: course in space-time statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to talk to us today about soil
types, accessing soil surveys,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil physical, chemical, and
biological properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm going to turn it over
to Harold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good day, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful day here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see a lot of familiar names here on
the participant list, so I say hi to all
[SPEAKER_04]: of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pleasure to be able to present this
through this format.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today, this will be more of an
introductory webinar as it relates to
[SPEAKER_04]: berry production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the more subsequent webinars,
we're going to be talking more about sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of management approaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today will be a bit more conceptual.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk more about the principles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a quick outline for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start out with discussion on soil
health concepts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll discuss the concept of inherent soil
quality and the use of soil survey
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll discuss each of the three
realms of soil health, the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics and measurements,
the physical, and then the biological.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the biological, we'll also talk
quite a bit about the role of organic
[SPEAKER_04]: matter, which is a key component.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then towards the end, I'll just have a
few slides about management considerations
[SPEAKER_04]: for berry production, basically as an
introduction to the subsequent webinars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of you, I think, are probably
familiar with this concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like to refer to soil health as
the capacity of the soil to function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can think of a much larger
definition.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all about how the soil functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all familiar with the concept of
human health and how we as humans
[SPEAKER_04]: function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly, we think about soils
functioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the context of this discussion,
of course, the primary function for that
[SPEAKER_04]: soil is to produce a good crop,
both high quality and high quantities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are characteristics of a healthy
soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the same way we think of a healthy
human being as having blood pressure in a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain range, 120 over 80, a heartbeat at
a certain rate, a cholesterol level at a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of healthy soils, we can think
of all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is certainly not an exhaustive
list.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a sufficient amount of nutrients,
but not excess, because that can create
[SPEAKER_04]: problems environmentally or agronomically
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some cases, good tills, sufficient
depth for good rooting, good water storage
[SPEAKER_04]: and drainage to get it through dry and wet
periods, free of harmful chemicals,
[SPEAKER_04]: low populations of plant disease and
parasitic organisms, and vice versa,
[SPEAKER_04]: higher populations of beneficial
organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low weed pressure, resistance to being
degraded, to say, through compaction or
[SPEAKER_04]: erosion, and a resilient soil that
recovers quickly from adverse events like
[SPEAKER_04]: excess water or hurricane or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's important to sort of understand
is our soil health philosophy that we
[SPEAKER_04]: think in terms of the three major realms.
[SPEAKER_04]: The physical, the chemical, and the
biological.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole point is that a healthy soil
is balanced in that respect and therefore
[SPEAKER_04]: provides for good growing conditions and
resiliency and also reduced inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, over the past decades,
we've tended to overemphasize the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to a fault necessarily,
but we've developed good testing
[SPEAKER_04]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most farmers and growers know how
to use and manage the chemistry of the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The physical aspects, and especially the
biological aspect, we haven't really paid
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly as much attention to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, these are also a very important
component of the functioning of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So during this webinar, I'm going to pay a
little bit more attention to the physical
[SPEAKER_04]: and the biological components.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we think in terms of the
functioning of the soil, we can sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: parse that down to processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on this slide, we have the three
realms, physical, biological, and
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the side there, you see the
different processes that are critical for
[SPEAKER_04]: a soil to function well.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, physical support is a
physical function.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aeration is a physical process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water storage and movement, resistance to
erosion, root proliferation, and organism
[SPEAKER_04]: movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all physical processes that are
affected by things like compaction and
[SPEAKER_04]: aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the chemical realm, the one that we're
typically a little bit more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient storage and release, soil
reaction, which relates mostly to pH,
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon storage, and energy, which is the
important role of organic matter that
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll discuss later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have all those important
biological functions, suppressing pests,
[SPEAKER_04]: and vice versa, having beneficial
organisms, nitrogen mineralization,
[SPEAKER_04]: organic matter decomposition, and
supporting microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have these three realms.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do interact, and we'll talk about
that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's important that we think in terms
of the processes, because if any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: processes is compromised, for example,
if you have poor aeration, and there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of other problems that result from
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, more disease problems,
nutrient deficiencies, and all those kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important that we think in terms
of processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another concept that we need to keep in
mind is that of inherent versus dynamic
[SPEAKER_04]: soil quality, and that not all soils are
the same that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we mean by inherent soil quality?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the idea that soils are
created differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: That some soils are sandy, others are
maybe silt loams, and yet others are clay
[SPEAKER_04]: loams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really the result of all these
kind of natural genetic soil forming
[SPEAKER_04]: processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some soils are naturally well-drained,
others are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are naturally high in organic matter,
others are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is sort of the basic soil quality
that is often also represented in the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: survey information.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dynamic soil quality, on the other
hand, relates more to how the soil has
[SPEAKER_04]: developed as a result of management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can think of that in terms of both
negative and positive directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a very high quality soil may become
very degraded due to erosion, or
[SPEAKER_04]: compaction, or a lot of intensive tillage
over many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it may become a less desirable and
less well-functioning soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, you can improve a soil
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take a soil that's low in organic
matter content, and over a period of five
[SPEAKER_04]: or six years, you can build that up to
become a much more high quality soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about soil health,
we primarily refer to this dynamic soil
[SPEAKER_04]: quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the part of the soil quality that we
can influence by management.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other component, the inherent soil
quality, is more or less a given.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't necessarily change that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, the inherent soil quality,
the results of some of these long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: geologic, biotic, climatic, and
topographic factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this blueberry field here is located in
kind of a valley environment with certain
[SPEAKER_04]: soil types, maybe gravelly or sandy soil,
as you often find in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the soil, say, on this hillside,
would be very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have different depths,
different organic matter content,
[SPEAKER_04]: different drainage, more susceptible to
erosion, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So typically, the first thing that you
want to do is select a site that has
[SPEAKER_04]: favorable soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do that by using soil survey
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: The site selection, I would say,
is critical to successful berry
[SPEAKER_04]: management.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you start out with a soil that's
inherently of low quality, you're just
[SPEAKER_04]: basically having an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult to overcome a lot of those
constraints.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are some of those inherent primary
properties?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think most of you are familiar with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the physical ones,
soil texture, of course, is very critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you have sand, silt, clay,
or anything in between, whether you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of stones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's often sort of sets a lot of the
other important soil properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you have a problem with internal
drainage or not, you can modify that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a drainage problem,
then you probably want to install some
[SPEAKER_04]: drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: The depth of the soil, or presence of
barriers, for example, a fragile pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can sometimes be modified,
but may be a major constraint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then slope can also be an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the chemistry, we have,
and we'll come back to that, we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of nutrients that we're concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: pH is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though a lot of these can be
corrected and modified, it's typically,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you start out with a soil, for example,
that's very acidic, it's often difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: to overcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another important point to make,
of course, is that especially with berry
[SPEAKER_04]: production, that certain crops favor a
lower pH, like blueberries, and others do
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's all something that you have
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt accumulation is not as much of a
concern here in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in other parts of the country or the
world, that can be a major constraint,
[SPEAKER_04]: very difficult to overcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have a number of, of course,
biological components.
[SPEAKER_04]: And typically, in terms of the basic
primary properties, that is expressed
[SPEAKER_04]: through the organic matter content in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have higher organic matter levels,
typically that soil is healthier,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can support a lot more diverse and
intensive biological processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk about that in a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much of that basic information on these
primary properties can be gathered from
[SPEAKER_04]: soil survey reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a selection of soil surveys from
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are quite old.
[SPEAKER_04]: The early ones are from the 1930s,
and then the most recent ones are from the
[SPEAKER_04]: 1990s, I think maybe even from the
century.
[SPEAKER_04]: They provide you with all that basic
information about texture, pH,
[SPEAKER_04]: available water capacity, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tells you what the suitability for use
of any of those soils is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it good farmland?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the constraints,
for example?
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind that with in-site
variability may be a factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: These soils have been mapped by soil
surveyors, but typically the level of
[SPEAKER_04]: detail that needs to be considered for,
say, the establishment of an orchard or a
[SPEAKER_04]: berry production field is not quite
sufficient, but it's a very good early
[SPEAKER_04]: start.
[SPEAKER_04]: These publications are available from
extension offices, from Soil and Water
[SPEAKER_04]: Conservation District offices,
and Natural Resources Conservation
[SPEAKER_04]: Districts, and several other places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often libraries have them as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to point out that a lot of
this information now is available also
[SPEAKER_04]: through the Web, through the Web Soil
Survey site.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, if you just Google Web Soil
Survey, you will get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allows you to basically access soil
survey information for any location in the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you would do is you would start by
pressing this virtual button here that
[SPEAKER_04]: says Start Web Soil Survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you would get to, through various
screens, you would get to something like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say we're interested in establishing
some berry production on a field that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have perhaps like here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can get a lot of basic
information about that soil from this Web
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil Survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the left here, you see this area is
an Ontario loam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two to eight percent slope gives us
information on some basic climatological
[SPEAKER_04]: information, the geomorphological setting
of this soil, and some very basic
[SPEAKER_04]: properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can get more information for this
soil, and that's listed here on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: The basic chemical properties like calcium
carbonate content, cation exchange
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity, pH, gypsum level, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now keep in mind that this is sort of the
expected chemical properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not actually from this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to be from another soil profile
that is representative of that field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may have been changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The previous user may have changed the pH
by liming or the sodium absorption ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: may have been changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are all things that at least
provide a starting point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see a lot of physical properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Available water capacity, bulk density,
although it may have changed due to
[SPEAKER_04]: compaction, organic matter content,
texture, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of basic information,
also including water table information
[SPEAKER_04]: that is an excellent starting point that
you can access directly from the web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, so that basically relates to the
inherent soil properties, but we typically
[SPEAKER_04]: want to get some more detailed
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only for it to be more site-specific,
so actually soil samples that were
[SPEAKER_04]: collected from that particular field where
we're considering to establish berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also more detailed information on the
physical, the biological, and the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: components of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the Soil Health Test or
the Cornell Soil Health Test basically
[SPEAKER_04]: attempts to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've selected four physical indicators,
and physical in our case is always
[SPEAKER_04]: indicated with the letter blue or the
color blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biological indicators, also four indicated
in green, and then in yellow the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Soil Health Test, which we'll come
back to in later webinars, basically uses
[SPEAKER_04]: the standard soil nutrient analysis and
then has enhanced it with four biological
[SPEAKER_04]: indicators, organic matter, active carbon,
potentially mineralizable nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a root health rating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these four physical indicators,
aggregate stability, available water
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity, and hardness of the soil and the
surface and the subsurface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the test identifies constraints,
and that then allows you to take some
[SPEAKER_04]: management actions to overcome those
constraints.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a basic introduction to
that, but one of the main points is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the inherent soil quality can be
gathered from the soil survey information,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the more dynamic soil quality or soil
health you want to get from some more
[SPEAKER_04]: site-specific information like through a
soil health test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about
chemical processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of you, I think, that's the area that
you're more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of essential nutrients
for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left, we have the large ones that
are needed in larger amounts or
[SPEAKER_04]: macronutrients, including carbon,
oxygen, hydrogen, which are basically
[SPEAKER_04]: around from the air and water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have the NPK, nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
[SPEAKER_04]: and magnesium, and sulfur that are needed
in larger quantities, and any of these may
[SPEAKER_04]: be limiting at any time.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right, we have the micronutrients,
iron, manganese, et cetera, and these are
[SPEAKER_04]: used in relatively small quantities.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fortunate part is that recommendations
have been developed over the past decades
[SPEAKER_04]: for the management of all of these
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, what it requires is a basic
soil test, and recommendations come with
[SPEAKER_04]: that, and it's a fairly straightforward
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's typically relatively easy to correct
any of these deficiencies through the use
[SPEAKER_04]: of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: pH tends to be a little bit more tricky in
that berry plants favor different pH
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, but also the availability of
various nutrients is impacted by pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the right here, we have a scale from
pH of four and a half to eight,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we see that different nutrients,
nitrates, potassium, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: are more or less available in different pH
ranges.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, phosphates or phosphorus is
not very available either at very high pH
[SPEAKER_04]: or low pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Calcium is very available at higher pH,
but not at the low pH, where we may have a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of aluminum available, and in fact,
it may become toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Iron, very available at low pH,
but not very available at high pH,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pH is actually a very critical
component, and the reason why I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: discuss this separately is that from the
perspective of establishing berries,
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to address this upfront.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get to pH right from the
start, and before you establish the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, you have your best opportunity to
correct any potential pH problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the soil test will provide you with
the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another concept that we often talk about,
and those of you who have taken a soil
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility class are familiar with this,
is the so-called Liebig's law of the
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is that your yield or the ability
of the plant to be productive is limited
[SPEAKER_04]: by the most limiting nutrient,
and it's represented by this bucket here.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our case, nitrogen is the most limiting
nutrient, and so the yield potential is
[SPEAKER_04]: limited by the amount of nitrogen in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is here depicted by the water
overflowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get more water in the bucket
than the lowest level and the most
[SPEAKER_04]: limiting nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is generally true, but there is
basically a broader perspective that we
[SPEAKER_04]: now come to appreciate in the context of
soil health, and that's basically that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not all about the soil chemistry,
that it may actually be a physical or it
[SPEAKER_04]: may be a biological process that is the
most limiting factor in the production.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only what's the most limiting
chemical element, but it's more what's
[SPEAKER_04]: limiting otherwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may, for example, have a very
compacted soil, and there may be plenty of
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients, and you may have actually
applied a lot of these nutrients through
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer, but the fact that the soil is
compacted, that the roots aren't growing
[SPEAKER_04]: well, or that you have aeration problems
has become the most limiting element.
[SPEAKER_04]: Janet Fallon next week will be talking
about soil testing, and I won't go into a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of detail, but an interesting point to
keep in mind is that soil test is
[SPEAKER_04]: basically an extraction procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically extract some of the elements
through a solution out of the soil that's
[SPEAKER_04]: being filtered and then analyzed with
various equipment, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: like an ICP or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's important to keep in mind is that
there are many different soil test
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions that are being used around the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even within the Northeast, we have quite a
few different ones being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Malik 3 and modified Morgan
are being used around the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to make a distinction
because the interpretation of the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: test results, and in this case,
for example, it's for phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_04]: varies based on the type of extraction
that you use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are more aggressive
extractants, or they're done at a
[SPEAKER_04]: different pH, and so you interpret the
numbers differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in a Morgan analysis,
the optimum range for phosphorus is about
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 to 7, while the equivalent for Malik 3
is 15 to 31.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to basically tie your soil test
results to the actual methodology that was
[SPEAKER_04]: used in the testing procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, for better or worse,
we're using a lot of different procedures
[SPEAKER_04]: around the region and around the country
especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep that in mind when you think about
soil testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to the physical aspects of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the big factors, especially here in
the Northeast, that can limit the ability
[SPEAKER_04]: of a healthy plant is poor internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Internal drainage can be the result of
either of local soil hydrology because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in a low spot in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can also be because of impeding soil
layers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have a dense layer or a fragile
pen that limits the percolation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: water through the soil and thereby causes
poor drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor drainage means poor aeration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can exacerbate disease problems and all
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're considering a field that has
poor internal drainage, you either may
[SPEAKER_04]: want to move to a different field or you
make sure that you identify or that you
[SPEAKER_04]: correct that problem through the
installation of drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is identifying from soil survey
publications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed that in one of the previous
slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also would always suggest, because the
soil survey publication is just a first
[SPEAKER_04]: approximation, to also do some onsite soil
excavations.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see modeling or blotches of iron
rust or manganese, which is black
[SPEAKER_04]: blotches, if you see that in the subsoil,
you typically have a problem with the
[SPEAKER_04]: fluctuating water table and therefore you
have imperfect drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a theme that I'll be coming
back to.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times we ignore what's happening
deeper in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tend to focus on the surface soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor drainage is often expressed a little
bit deeper in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, of course, remediate poor internal
drainage by installing drain lines,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also raised beds, as you can see here
on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are actually tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest with almost any type of
berry production that you want to use
[SPEAKER_04]: raised beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reasons, certainly,
is to improve the drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least during very wet periods,
it keeps the roots of your berries under
[SPEAKER_04]: aerobic conditions and you prevent some of
those problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind that in some cases,
poor drainage is not necessarily related
[SPEAKER_04]: to soil layers or local soil hydrology,
but it can be a symptom of compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see a lot of water sitting on the
soil surface, that may be because the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: has become very degraded and compacted and
the water doesn't move and infiltrate
[SPEAKER_04]: through the soil, which is then a problem
that you need to separately address.
[SPEAKER_04]: Installing tile drains doesn't necessarily
solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to address that through the
organic batter additions or putting in a
[SPEAKER_04]: cover crop or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to, when I talk about the
physical properties of soils, I like to
[SPEAKER_04]: discuss the importance of aggregates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a picture of a large aggregate
that's about of this size.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, that aggregate is made up,
actually, of three sub-aggregates,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of those three are then, in turn,
made up of other sub-aggregates.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's typically a hierarchical system in
a well-aggregated soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you especially have a finer textured
soil like a silt or clay loam,
[SPEAKER_04]: then this aggregation is very important
because it creates larger pores while also
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining these smaller pores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Larger pores are important for drainage
and aeration and for root development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small pores, on the other hand,
are important for moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we want some intermediate pores as
well so that we basically have a range
[SPEAKER_04]: also important for water retention.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the biological functions,
a lot of the organisms dwell in these
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediate pores.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we'd like to see with a good soil is
this range of pores from large to
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediate to small.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens when a soil becomes
compacted?
[SPEAKER_04]: You mostly lose in that case these large
pores.
[SPEAKER_04]: What problems do you then get?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get problems with drainage,
you get problems with aeration,
[SPEAKER_04]: and root proliferation becomes a factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compaction basically creates a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, in turn, can create other problems
like higher disease pressure, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit about water evaporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of water available to
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of you, I think, are familiar with
the idea of a soil that has poor plant
[SPEAKER_04]: water availability like a beach sand
because it only has large pores.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have any small pores.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, you may have a clay
loam that has a lot of small pores and so
[SPEAKER_04]: it has much better ability to retain
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a function of texture, organic
matter content, however, is also a very
[SPEAKER_04]: important component of this because
organic matter can really act as a sponge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirdly, rooting depth is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have roots that are constrained,
say, to only the top six inches,
[SPEAKER_04]: then they won't be able to access the
water and the nutrients that are deeper in
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compaction is a big problem in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reduces both root proliferation and
water access by the plants, but we can
[SPEAKER_04]: improve that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that later in the course.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can use things like deep ripping,
as you see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a strip-till piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can add compost, for example,
to improve the structure and the
[SPEAKER_04]: aggregation and the rooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are ways to address that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor soils in our climates are often
associated with good drainage,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a gravelly loam or loamy sand or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to then have problems with water
stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: In most cases, that's not desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you're growing grapes,
you often want a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_04]: stress, but for most berries, it's not
very desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that you may have to invest in
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some very good irrigation
systems available now and a lot of that
[SPEAKER_04]: requires some upfront considerations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking ahead of time of what the water
storage capacity of your soil is and
[SPEAKER_04]: whether you need to invest in irrigation
is an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about soil
compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left, you see a soil with good
rooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roots extend both in the surface layer
as well as into the subsoil and the deeper
[SPEAKER_04]: layers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that this plant would have a
lot of water and nutrients available to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to see fairly dense rooting
patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right, you see a soil that has
multiple compaction problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, it may have a crust on the surface,
which often happens when the soil is
[SPEAKER_04]: exposed to the elements, especially the
raindrops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That reduces infiltration and causes
runoff and erosion problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may also have very tightly packed
crumbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've lost those large pores that are
essential for aeration and water
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it limits the rooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we only have a few roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this particular case, we additionally
have a subsoil compaction problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the roots don't even go down into the
deeper layers and cannot access the water
[SPEAKER_04]: and nutrients in those layers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_04]: Extended periods of saturation are often a
symptom of compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that here on the left,
if you have a compacted layer,
[SPEAKER_04]: the water doesn't drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Standing water, following a rain or
irrigation, they all may be indicators of
[SPEAKER_04]: plow layer compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the soil gets tilled, and of course,
you may only do this in the establishment
[SPEAKER_04]: phase, but if you see these big clods,
that's typically an indication of a very
[SPEAKER_04]: compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that you want to address.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tilling it and doing some primary
tillage, but then doing disking and
[SPEAKER_04]: harrowing and pulverizing that soil
doesn't really address the problem because
[SPEAKER_04]: soon enough that soil will settle.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see on the right here,
once it gets wet, it will settle and it
[SPEAKER_04]: will become dense and hard, and the roots
will have problems growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend doing some upfront work
and take a shovel out or a penetrometer or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that and look and see
whether you have any of these problems
[SPEAKER_04]: because some of the past management of
that particular field prior to
[SPEAKER_04]: establishing the berry plants may have
caused considerable compaction and you
[SPEAKER_04]: first want to address that in a meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as a little bit more information on
that, I wanted to show this to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually part of a video clip that
I can't show because of the limitation of
[SPEAKER_04]: the webinar technology, but there's two
important points.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, that a root is a certain dimension,
especially the root tip, and so you need
[SPEAKER_04]: pores that are greater than 0.2
millimeters for a root tip to enter into a
[SPEAKER_04]: pore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It first needs to wedge itself into that
pore and then it starts to push the
[SPEAKER_04]: particles and the aggregates to the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that soil is very hard and it has a
strength of greater than 300 PSI,
[SPEAKER_04]: then it has great difficulty doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For roots to grow well, you need pores
that are greater than 0.2 millimeters and
[SPEAKER_04]: strength that is less than 300 PSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, what that means is a
well-aggregated soil or a naturally softer
[SPEAKER_04]: soil like a sandy loam or silt loam type
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right here you see an example of
where this was a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: This big soil clod, we see one root here
that explored a little bit of that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a few fine root hairs, but most of
that soil is basically not being explored
[SPEAKER_04]: by the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water and nutrients that are in the
rest of the soil volume are inaccessible
[SPEAKER_04]: to the plant, so that tends to cause more
stress for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the causes of flower
layer compaction?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, a loss of organic matter and
thereby aggregate stability mostly from
[SPEAKER_04]: intensive tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this field has a legacy of intensive
tillage, maybe vegetable production or
[SPEAKER_04]: potatoes or field crops and low organic
matter contents, you're going to have some
[SPEAKER_04]: of these types of problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, of course, there's been no organic
matter addition, so if there's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: history of manure application or compost,
then you have greater potential for
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's been a lot of traffic when the
soil was wet, a lack of control traffic,
[SPEAKER_04]: so basically the entire field was
compacted, and if we had a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_04]: settling from some of the primary causes
and you may want to look at the history of
[SPEAKER_04]: that field to see whether that was a
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's briefly talk about subsoil
compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we're considering not the surface
layer, but really the compaction that's
[SPEAKER_04]: deeper in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to be a little bit more difficult
to address.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's very invisible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see the subsoil unless you
really make an effort and you dig down to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a lot of people are not aware of the
causes of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are in a field that has,
say, a history of heavy traffic like
[SPEAKER_04]: manure spreaders, especially on wet soils,
you may have a problem with subsoil
[SPEAKER_04]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The deeper layers may have become very
dense because the loads from this heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment are basically transferred deeper
into the soil, and when that soil is wet,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can compact them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is especially a problem if there's a
poor weight distribution of the equipment,
[SPEAKER_04]: so some of the more modern equipment have
less of a problem, but if this field has a
[SPEAKER_04]: history of the kind of stuff you see on
the left here, you probably have a fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: serious subsoil compaction in addition to
having compaction near the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's been a history of plowing,
because a lot of plowing occurs with the
[SPEAKER_04]: wheel in the open furrow, which means that
the subsoil is directly compacted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely something to look into
with, say, a penetrometer or some digging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to consider where the
compaction is, and these penetrometers,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're relatively inexpensive tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cost a little over $200.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you can borrow them from an
extension agent or a soda water
[SPEAKER_04]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are very valuable tools, and they are
also an integral part of our Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: Serial Health Test.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have that deep soil compaction,
maybe some deep tillage is needed,
[SPEAKER_04]: deep rooted cover crop maybe needs to be
established before you transplant your
[SPEAKER_04]: areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shallow compaction requires a different
strategy than deep compaction,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why it's important to measure
where the compaction is, and we'll come
[SPEAKER_04]: back to this in the seminars later in the
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we talked about the chemical,
the physical, and now let's discuss the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the component of the soil that's
still very much at the frontier of
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soils are extremely complex and have very
variable conditions, but we do know that
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the biological activity occurs
near the surface, the reason being that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's where most of the organic matter is
from basically often from the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: sources that decay, and the organic matter
decreases as we go further into the soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: and thereby also the biological activity
decreases considerably.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often, and I mean Fred Magdoff and I,
and we co-authored a book that I'll refer
[SPEAKER_04]: to a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to think in terms of organic
matter as three general types,
[SPEAKER_04]: living, dead, and very dead, and I'll talk
about each of those individually,
[SPEAKER_04]: but all three are very important in terms
of the functioning of the soil to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: high yields and healthy crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's first start talking about the
living part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, let's see, there's a quick
overview of each of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the living component of the soil is
what is alive in the soil basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's these organisms they play
important roles in making nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: available, suppressing disease,
producing plant growth, promoting
[SPEAKER_04]: hormones, creating humus, aggregating
soils, and there's probably a few other
[SPEAKER_04]: things we can mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another living component is plant roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are also, it's the below ground part
of the plants, and they also are typically
[SPEAKER_04]: very beneficial, and of course they're
needed for the plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dead part relates to the recently dead
organisms and crop residues that provide
[SPEAKER_04]: basically the energy and nutrients for the
soil organisms to live and function.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also often called as active or particulate
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the food that sustains the
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third component is basically the
fraction of the organic matter that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: as active biologically, has become very
well decomposed but that is really quite
[SPEAKER_04]: recalcitrant, and we often refer to that
as humus, or the kind of lack material in
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also very beneficial primarily in
terms of supporting some of the physical
[SPEAKER_04]: and the chemical functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a high amount of negative charge,
so it allows it to hold nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: it allows it to hold water, and it also
stores a lot of the carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at each of those in a little
bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the living here, and we can teach an
entire course on this, it's all those
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms like the bacteria, fungi,
nematodes, earthworms, mites, springtails,
[SPEAKER_04]: moles, and many other organisms that are
in the soil that all play a very important
[SPEAKER_04]: role in terms of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all interact in often very,
very complex ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course the plant roots as you
can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left you have the micro-organisms,
on the right here you have these critters,
[SPEAKER_04]: the colombo, the spiders, the mites,
etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we might even have things like
earthworms, or even macro-organisms like
[SPEAKER_04]: moles that of course also impact the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: These organisms use the resources in the
soil, that's where they live, they
[SPEAKER_04]: decompose organic matter, they cycle
nutrients, they influence plants and all
[SPEAKER_04]: the other biota.
[SPEAKER_04]: They respond to chemical and physical
environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you, for example, have a very
compacted soil, so an unfavorable physical
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, you will have less organisms
and less diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if you have a soil like you
see here in the middle picture,
[SPEAKER_04]: very compacted, exposed to the elements,
so therefore the organisms have to deal
[SPEAKER_04]: with heat and moisture extremes as opposed
to a situation here where we have compost
[SPEAKER_04]: on the soil and the soil is protected.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a much more favorable environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have say low pH or high pH,
that all impacts these organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But vice versa, these organisms also
affect the chemical and the physical
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be beneficial, for example,
if you have a lot of plant roots or you
[SPEAKER_04]: have a lot of organisms that decompose
organic matter, that creates better
[SPEAKER_04]: aggregation, so better physical
environment, better aeration, better water
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: The organisms respond to the environment
and they manipulate the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some organisms that are
particularly noteworthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are basically fungi with extended
hyphae, as you can see in this picture,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a way you can think of as a symbiotic
relationship with plant roots that can
[SPEAKER_04]: extend the plant roots into the soil and
basically facilitate better nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: acquisition and use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they enhance nutrient uptake,
phosphorous nitrogen, potassium and
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrients, but especially phosphorous
is often very much enhanced by
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help with soil aggregation,
form of defense against pathogens,
[SPEAKER_04]: protect plants against phytotoxicity and
enhance fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mycorrhizae, especially in soils that
are not disturbed, can be very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another important concept is that of
suppressive soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often have problems with certain
diseases, bithium, phytophthora,
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizectonia, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we create a healthy soil with lots of
organisms, beneficial organisms like
[SPEAKER_04]: pseudomonas and trichoderma, they actually
provide an ability to suppress some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these soil borne pathogens, basically by
either direct suppression or basically by
[SPEAKER_04]: a larger abundance and sort of
out-competing some of these pathogenic
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having a rich soil often can be very
beneficial in terms of reducing pest
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do management practices affect soil
life?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, intensive tillage reduces
mycorrhizae colonizations, reduces
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity of soil organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tillage is often not favorable for
healthy soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic matter application is favorable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases diversity, density and
activity of these organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fertilizer application affects the various
organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It proliferates the growth of fast-growing
microorganisms, typically more bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: but reduces, say, fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it reduces, say, nitrogen-fixating
organisms as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Irrigation and drainage, of course,
affects the anaerobic versus aerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked about the living,
now a little bit about the dead organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's basically crop residues and dead
plant roots and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of that as the food that sustains
these organisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are nutrients and energy that help
feed these organisms that are so
[SPEAKER_04]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the soil food web, which is depicted
here, we're not talking about a food
[SPEAKER_04]: chain, but a more complex food web where
multiple organisms are involved in the use
[SPEAKER_04]: of basically this organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the organic matter in the soil
that may be applied through manure or
[SPEAKER_04]: compost or maybe dead roots or soil
surface material that basically feeds all
[SPEAKER_04]: these other organisms, bacteria,
fungi, nematodes, that in turn affects all
[SPEAKER_04]: these other organisms like protozoa,
arthropods, and so you kind of go up the
[SPEAKER_04]: food web and the food chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the important point here is that if
you don't supply this organic matter,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's not there, then these organisms
cannot thrive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what often is referred to as the
bottom-up effect or the abundance of a
[SPEAKER_04]: resource affects the abundance of its
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it in terms of the human analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we did not feed ourselves and get our
energy and nutrients, we would not thrive
[SPEAKER_04]: either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just as important in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the very dead component then is the
well-decomposed material.
[SPEAKER_04]: You often see that as sort of the black
part of the soil, the dark part.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is very important for water holding
capacity, but also to retain cations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So especially in a sandy soil,
increasing the humus content allows for
[SPEAKER_04]: better water and nutrient storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: An important point I think by now has been
that we have this interaction of the
[SPEAKER_04]: physical, the chemical, and the
biological.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the past, because we focused so much
on the chemical, we didn't have all these
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits of these interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, based on the discussions,
I'll give you five seconds to think of any
[SPEAKER_04]: examples of how each of these realms
interact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wish I could ask you how many of
you could come up with one or two or
[SPEAKER_04]: three, but here are a number that I came
up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've indicated a blue is being a
physical process, green being a biological
[SPEAKER_04]: process, and yellow being a chemical
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, hard soil, a physical
process, reduces rooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Acted soil suppresses beneficial
biological processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Action also increases root diseases and
denitrification, both biological process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic matter decomposition, a biological
process, increases aggregation,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillage in the bottom here increases
bacteria and increases fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's many ways in which these
interact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the point is that with
our past emphasis on the chemical part,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've often not given enough consideration
for these biological and physical
[SPEAKER_04]: components.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's become clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that adding organic matter results
in many benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a depiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually from a picture from Lori
Drinkwater in the horticulture department.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the benefits of adding organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases biological activity and
composition, nutrient release,
[SPEAKER_04]: detoxifies harmful substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases aggregation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It promotes humus and other
growth-promoting substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases pore structure, improves soil
and tills and water storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all in all, healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a general view of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple more points I wanted to make
is that what has happened over the past
[SPEAKER_04]: decades is that it's been a different
paradigm in soil management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the old days, certainly in terms of
the natural ecosystems, they evolved with
[SPEAKER_04]: little disturbance.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were either forest or grassland or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nutrients were recycled through organic
materials like leaves and animal
[SPEAKER_04]: droppings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decomposing materials would be feeding the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be nutrients and carbon and
stimulated diverse biological activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this organic material was then
mineralized by all these organisms and
[SPEAKER_04]: that in turn would feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants were in a way fed
indirectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nutrients and the energy came from the
surface, was processed by these organisms
[SPEAKER_04]: and that in turn fed the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: In modern agriculture, with the onset of
the use of fertilizer, we've started to
[SPEAKER_04]: disturb the soil through a lot of tillage
and so we accelerated organic matter
[SPEAKER_04]: mineralization and we have now lower
organic matter levels in the soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use chemical fertilizers where we
basically feed the plant directly rather
[SPEAKER_04]: than indirectly through the addition of
organic materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've stopped feeding all the soil
organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've seen over the decades a very big
difference in terms of the ecology of the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil and that's why the physical and the
biological processes in the soils have
[SPEAKER_04]: become very compromised because of those
practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, few important points.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inherent versus dynamic soil quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we get is natural soil versus how
we manage it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to focus especially on this
dynamic soil health component.
[SPEAKER_04]: Physical, chemical and biological.
[SPEAKER_04]: By now, I hope you sort of appreciate the
importance of all of those components and
[SPEAKER_04]: they are equally important.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit about pre and post
establishment and I'll talk about that in
[SPEAKER_04]: the next couple of slides because that's
an important consideration from a
[SPEAKER_04]: management perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, both the surface and the subsoil
are important and also we have to think in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of short-term and long-term
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the chemical management is
short-term.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a constraint, say low phosphorus
levels, we apply fertilizer, problem
[SPEAKER_04]: solved.
[SPEAKER_04]: With soil health, we often have to look at
a more long-term approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it comes to a berry production,
most opportune time for soil health
[SPEAKER_04]: improvement is typically prior to
planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stalling drain tiles, correcting subsoil
fertility, pH, deep ripping or other types
[SPEAKER_04]: of deep tillage, compost applications,
over cropping, all prior to establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when you have the opportunity to
address a lot of these constraints and
[SPEAKER_04]: keep in mind that subsoil properties are
not always that visible or any constraint
[SPEAKER_04]: that you might have, but they are
important for perennial crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, you still have
opportunities for post-establishment soil
[SPEAKER_04]: health management, like for example,
continuous supply of compost, using
[SPEAKER_04]: mulches to protect the soil, to promote
good biological activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we can use the inter-rows for,
say, cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you see in this particular case,
these are grape vines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to distinguish a little bit
between pre and post establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is my final slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some reference material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the website for the soil health
program is listed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you go there, you see at this
point, there's a lot of other sites that
[SPEAKER_04]: go with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download the soil health training
manual, which we'll refer to at a later
[SPEAKER_04]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're interested in a broader
perspective on soil health management,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a book that I co-authored with
Fred Magdoff from the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Vermont titled Building Soils for Better
Crops, which is really about sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: soil management or soil health management.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available from the Sustainable Ag
Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can also be downloaded as a PDF file
from their website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with that, Jeff, I'll hand it back
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we enter our Q&A period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you, if you have any
questions, to type them into the chat box,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll address them as they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few questions early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy asked a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is soil tilth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil tilth basically relates to kind of
the aggregation structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a soil that has good soil tilth is not
compacted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has these aggregates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And typically, if you disturb the soil,
it doesn't come up as clods, but it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: up as nice friable material.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's maybe the best way to characterize
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of soil tilth, to some extent,
as aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can a fragile pan layer be fixed by
subsoiling?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can initially, depending on the depth
of the fragile pan layer, if it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: deep, let's say two and a half feet,
then it's difficult to get down that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's a shallow layer, you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do tend to reform.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were considering establishing
berries on a fragile pan soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would definitely do that deep tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do tend to reestablish over a
longer time period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking more about maybe eight to
10 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about surface compaction versus
compaction in the deeper layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's a lot of discussion about
the use of cover crops to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you comment on cover cropping use for
compaction modification?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we think about cover crops,
we have to consider what really our
[SPEAKER_04]: objective is with the use of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we have a compaction problem near
the surface, we might want to use a very
[SPEAKER_04]: dense and fibrous cover crop, like rye
grass or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have compaction deeper in the soil,
we want to use a cover crop that has
[SPEAKER_04]: strong roots that go deeper into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, alfalfa roots do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of interest in using,
say, radishes that very aggressively grow
[SPEAKER_04]: deeper into the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it comes to cover cropping,
you really have to think about what your
[SPEAKER_04]: primary objective is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And compaction relief is only one of
several.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may also want to consider adding
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you want to use a cover crop so you get
some mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, for example, the picture that I
showed of the vineyard that had rye
[SPEAKER_04]: growing in the inter-rows, they cut that
and they used that to spread that over the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have all these different objectives
with cover crops, which is an interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: point in and by itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in using cover crop,
there is a great publication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe it's titled Managing Cover
Crops Profitably.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also published by the Sustainable Ag
Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know many of you are probably familiar
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who are not, that is
really an outstanding publication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it addresses the management of cover
crops from the perspective of what your
[SPEAKER_04]: objectives are, nitrogen management,
compaction relief, surface cover,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry, Jeff, that's a little bit of
a long-winded answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's cover crops, and there's cover
crops, and you want to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_04]: select the right one for the problem that
you're trying to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Tom Bjorkman also has a
web-based tool that does a pretty good job
[SPEAKER_00]: of describing the attributes of different
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy, in the meantime, had a comment or
question related to subsoiling and its use
[SPEAKER_00]: for crops like strawberries or raspberries
that have maybe a shorter time frame than
[SPEAKER_00]: something like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you comment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps I somewhat misrepresented this in
that there's various components to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think about subsoiling to
overcome a frangipan, then you do allow
[SPEAKER_04]: those roots to move into that frangipan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though the frangipan may somewhat
reestablish, once the roots are in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: they are there, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the subsoiling is always beneficial,
even though with blueberries maybe you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at a much longer time horizon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's those first years that are most
critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that you can get those roots down
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think it's in almost all cases,
it's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the subsoiling if you have a frangipan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an additional question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a couple of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage was one of them where you're
favoring bacteria over fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also mentioned that the use of
fertilizer does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does developing a cover crop actually work
in the opposite direction of boosting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi population?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it tends to, especially if you don't
do a lot of disturbance.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about cover crops,
you try to prevent doing a lot of tillage
[SPEAKER_04]: to establish a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd like to do it with equipment like
a no-till drill or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with berry production,
of course, you don't do much tillage,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe only early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what's critical is to think
about the history of that site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's been a lot of past tillage,
then it has impacted bacteria versus
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacteria being more common with
intensively tilled and fertilized fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have, say, berry production,
you would like to see more fungi because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the benefits that it provides.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will, of course, change over time
because once you establish your field and
[SPEAKER_04]: your berries, you won't do much intensive
tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you manage it well and you supply
your organic materials, you will see a
[SPEAKER_04]: gradual change in the biology of that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting to see if Ann has a question
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ann has a long question, I can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's more of a comment for
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is putting you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know that there are a number of
companies that sell products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would call them soil
amendments or plant enhancing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfair to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've talked about the biology of the
soil and how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any research that shows
benefits of some of these products?
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of products that are more
commercial products that are sold at maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: the regional or national level,
not very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the soil is low in organic matter
content, there are a number of ways to
[SPEAKER_04]: address that, say compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes if you have manure that's
available, say, from a nearby dairy farm
[SPEAKER_04]: or some other livestock farm, that can be
very beneficial as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Products that are more commercially sold,
some humic acids are sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen any research really that
supports that in a very significant way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say I would want to compare
that with, say, a compost application.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sometimes hear about remineralizing
soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remineralizing, it's kind of a difficult
word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where basically that's more geologic
material is being added.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will only be, you can only justify
that if you really do have deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times it's much easier to address
that with fertilizer if you're an organic
[SPEAKER_04]: producer and that's not an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really want to do some soil testing
first and see whether those elements are
[SPEAKER_04]: really limiting before you buy something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, Vern has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there practical ways to optimize
mycorrhizae and berry plantings other than
[SPEAKER_00]: avoiding high P and tillage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Vern, I'm getting on thin ice here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit beyond my expertise when
it comes to berry plantings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically having a healthy soil with
biology will basically favor the
[SPEAKER_04]: development of mycorrhizae in a system
that's not disturbed once you have that
[SPEAKER_04]: established.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there are inoculants being sold,
but I'd really have to find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps some other people that are in
here, maybe Marvin Ritz maybe knows that.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who have a little bit more
management experience with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vern, perhaps you know yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Marvin is typing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're waiting for them to respond,
I think we'll switch to the last screen
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have for you to view today and
encourage you all to attend future
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings that we're having coming up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already filled out the
demographics or the pre-test, please do
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that Marvin's response is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any strong data
indicating that these inoculants work,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in healthy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank our presenter,
Harold Van Ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Harold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you that the next portion
of this series is next week on October
[SPEAKER_00]: 14th from 2 to 3.15 in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be Janet Fallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be talking to us about soil
sampling procedures and soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, we're going to be signing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mention this one last comment here
from Glenn Kohler.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about perennial crops such as
fruit trees, a general guideline about
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing between use of inorganic versus
compost as a source for soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Glenn.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'm going to end the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say to you, I'm going to
leave this open so that you can download
[SPEAKER_00]: both the demographics and the pre-test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out the web links,
link up to them, save them for future
[SPEAKER_00]: reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, Kathy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I had already logged off and I had
somebody else.
That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it go well?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I was a little concerned that I was
a little rushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it not that case?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I thought it was great and I took tons
of notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was plenty of time to think about
things and whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's set to the stage for all those
other webinars that are going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: following.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, if you're talking to us,
we can't hear you for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to log off then.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Harold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad it went well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, I still can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was answering your question from
Room D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yes, it went pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold did a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it went fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bases were covered then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For next week, I didn't forget anything,
I guess is my question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, I don't believe so.
No, I don't believe so.
No, I don't believe so.
No, I don't believe so.
