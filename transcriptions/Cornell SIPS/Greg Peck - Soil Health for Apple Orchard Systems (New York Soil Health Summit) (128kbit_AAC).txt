[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Greg Peck and I'm an ophthalmologist,
meaning I work with food crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly with orchard systems and very
specifically with apple orchard systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been thinking a lot about
soil health for orchard systems for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, many decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a big part of my graduate
research and then my professional research
[SPEAKER_01]: since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the things that are quite
different about apple orchards and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable systems or about row crop
systems and agronomic crops is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: only get into the soil about once every 20
to 30 years to do tillage practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our opportunity to cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do pre-plant cover cropping,
we might add some compost, we adjust pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we plant the trees and then the
perennial system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those trees are there for a very long
time, for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the question becomes, well,
from a soil health perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can we do to increase the soil health
of the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Orchards have very different root
structures than annual systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also we've seen a change in our
orchard systems over the past 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that top picture shows what a
traditional orchard looked like 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Widely spaced trees on a 25 by 25 foot
grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we plant trees three feet apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers are now even planting trees a
foot and a half apart and 12 feet between
[SPEAKER_01]: rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very intensive systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require a lot more precision in terms
of our nutrient use, in terms of our water
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potentially we have an opportunity
here to do things to the soil to make
[SPEAKER_01]: those trees more productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom picture there is showing
myself and a former graduate student who's
[SPEAKER_01]: now a professor out at Oregon State with
some dwarfing rootstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using these new genotypes that
produce very small trees and with that
[SPEAKER_01]: very small root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the ways that we've been looking
at to increase soil health in orchard
[SPEAKER_01]: systems is through the use of mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, whereas we can't use cover crops,
it's harder for us to get compost on an
[SPEAKER_01]: annual basis, we can put mulch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding is that while
sometimes tree growth and yield is not
[SPEAKER_01]: always improved, although I'd have to say
look back at three of the last studies
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did and we always found an
increase in tree growth, particularly for
[SPEAKER_01]: our young plantings by using mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're seeing that more,
particularly in years like two years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and again this year when we had a very dry
June after planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing all these other benefits
for soil health that have been talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about already this morning and many of you
are familiar with increasing soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, increasing the water holding
capacity, increasing biological activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: making nutrients and minerals available
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see some suppressive effects for
diseases, erosion control on hillsides,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really important for Hudson River
Valley growers that grow on more slopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the picture here, this is actually
a organically managed orchard and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding that we are able to control weeds
effectively with mulch with an overlay of
[SPEAKER_01]: a second practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we do mulch with an herbicide,
with an organic herbicide, we can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: weed free strip that is very similar to
what the conventional growers are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: with straight herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has always been the barrier for
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always weed control, true in any
cropping system and it's true in orchard
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding tons of benefits,
reduced leaching of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mulch is really where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other positive effects, what this chart is
showing you is that under mulch,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the bars, the four bars on the
left side are the mulch treatments and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bars on the right hand side are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: No mulch treatments with and without
compost, with and without calcium nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: that mulching is increasing mycorrhizae in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are microorganisms that are
helping getting water and phosphorus into
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're finding great benefits from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that growers may not realize are
happening or happening below the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the soil health project,
we really want our metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want ways of trying to understand how
do we measure soil health for orchard
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may not always be able to show it in
short-term dollars and cents, but we can
[SPEAKER_01]: show it in long-term benefits of soil,
long-term benefits to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important for us
as we think about soil health is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: expand the crops that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at vegetable systems and
that we're also looking at perennial fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another picture of just a trial
looking at integrating practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and nutrients and other ways of
thinking about this creatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our growers are very interested in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just invited on Thursday to talk to
soil health to about 150 commercial apple
[SPEAKER_01]: growers along Lake Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are asking these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are not organic, just organic
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our largest conventional
mainstream growers in the state who are
[SPEAKER_01]: very interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks.

Thank you.
Thank you.
