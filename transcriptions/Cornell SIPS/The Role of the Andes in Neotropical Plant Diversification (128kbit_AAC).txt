[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks, Kevin, for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had a number of great talks this
morning with people already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the title of my talk is about the role
of the Andes in neotropical plant
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I sent that title, I realized
that I've only spent about six months
[SPEAKER_02]: working on this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you'll see is a lot about
lowland rainforest diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the latter part focused more
exclusively on the Andes, which is a sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of more recent development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Kevin mentioned, I'm very
interested in tropical forest biomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This graphic will probably explain why.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows the global distribution of tree
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have three main biomes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have arboreal forests represented in
blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our temperate zone forests in red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our tropical forests in green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of these boxes represents the
number of species of trees in each of
[SPEAKER_02]: these regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these numbers on the side indicate the
total tally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see 161 species, about 1,600
species here, and then 43,000 species in
[SPEAKER_02]: the tropical realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a huge diversity in global terms
in tropical forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you think not at the
regional or continental scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at a very local scale, there are many
species that are packed into very small
[SPEAKER_02]: areas in tropical forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this forest in Ecuador, Al Gentry
noted that there were 300 tree species,
[SPEAKER_02]: all above 10 centimeters in diameter,
in a single hectare of forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has been a topic that's been
interesting to biologists for over a
[SPEAKER_02]: century.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two main ways to approach this
question of why is it that there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: tropical diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is through an ecological approach,
which would focus on why there are so many
[SPEAKER_02]: species coexisting in small areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be focused on competition or
bivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other approach would be to look at the
evolutionary history of those forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of the main area that my
lab is interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overall talk outline, I'm going to
talk a bit about the history of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tropical forest biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk more exclusively about
rainforest, and particularly work that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done on the phylogeography of
widespread rainforest trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, I'm going to talk about
Andean plant diversification and its role
[SPEAKER_02]: in sort of creating all of this diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we think about tropical forest
history, we have to go back to Alfred
[SPEAKER_02]: Russell Wallace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he noticed way back in the 19th
century that one reason why tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: forests probably had so much diversity is
because they've been so stable as a biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do they not have these very
bitter winters and dormancy that's
[SPEAKER_02]: required of plants and animals,
but also over geological time periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been much more stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they haven't been recently wiped out by
glacial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we think about the geological
history of tropical forests, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: just present a little overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will take us back sort of starting at
the K-T boundary.
[SPEAKER_02]: K-T boundary is where we at least have
fossil records that we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had forests that are similar to modern
forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the K-T boundary and beyond in the
paleogene, we have, here is our
[SPEAKER_02]: representative of tropical forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're already outside of the
tropical region, we have to give another
[SPEAKER_02]: name for these forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we call megathermal forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are forests that cannot endure
any kind of freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're warmth-loving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the megathermal forests extended all
the way up into New York, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_02]: during the paleogene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a much greater expansion of
forests from 65 to 24 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is because the earth was much
warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was less of a latitudinal
gradient in changes in temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that from fossil records in
Columbia, the tropical forests were highly
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse, even in this very early stage of
rainforest development, as diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: probably as today, at least at the generic
level of genera.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at the neogene, sort of the
past 24 million years until the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: of the ice ages, we had many important
developments.
[SPEAKER_02]: The megathermal forests sort of shrank and
contracted into the equatorial regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're mostly within this tropical
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we see a lot of developments
geologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the emergence of the isthmus of
Panama, which is a land bridge that
[SPEAKER_02]: connects South America and North America,
allowing for the great American biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: interchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the development of the Andes
Mountains during this period in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is important in terms of the
development of sort of South American
[SPEAKER_02]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, the Quaternary,
the past 2.6 million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a period marked by major climatic
fluctuations, glacial, interglacial
[SPEAKER_02]: periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there were glacial periods,
that's when the forests shrank the most in
[SPEAKER_02]: their 65 million year history,
to much smaller extents than they were in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past 65 million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this led to the development of the
Pleistene Refuge Hypothesis, which posited
[SPEAKER_02]: that the contraction of these rainforests
would have led to an excessive accelerated
[SPEAKER_02]: rate of speciation during the past 2.6
million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the overall view.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look back 65 million years to
present, these are proxies for global mean
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this represents a higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the peak temperature was a sort of
Paleocene-Eocene boundary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our global temperatures have got
increasingly cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the Cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're moving back up into these
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the temperatures that are predicted
for the year 2100 are similar to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperatures that we see here in this
Neogene time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're even warmer earlier in the
Earth's history.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we discovered in just
looking at the phylogenies in the
[SPEAKER_02]: biogeographic history of the major
families that comprise rainforests,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that there has been a lot of movement
across continents of rainforest lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though we think of South America
as being isolated for tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, there's actually been dispersal
events that have been significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that have resulted in the
invasions of continental biotas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very quick depiction of continental drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about 65 million years worth of
movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at three million years ago,
we have Panama connecting North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have this great American biotic
interchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at many points throughout the past 65
million years, there have been migration
[SPEAKER_02]: events while South America was an island
continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including from these megathermal forests
that were in North America and Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we call the Boreotropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Asian forests, from Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Toby Pennington and I tried to
quantify the impact of this migration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at the Yassoni Forest
Inventory Plot, which is 25 hectares,
[SPEAKER_02]: has 1,100 species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we estimated that 30% of the tree
species and about 30% of the biomass,
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual stem counts, came from
immigrant lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very important impact of long distance
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this led to, there are two major ideas
when I was a graduate student that they
[SPEAKER_02]: had thought about.
[SPEAKER_02]: About tropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one that is associated with Alfred
Russell Wallace is that the tropics are a
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of museum of biological diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the stability of this biome and
their long history and being even more
[SPEAKER_02]: expansive than they are today,
species will be able to accumulate over
[SPEAKER_02]: time without much of an extinction rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so under this model, you'd expect to
have fairly old lineages that go all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way back through the Cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But under a cradle model, this is where
these other ideas about the impact of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential Pleistocene refugia coming into
play or maybe more recent geological
[SPEAKER_02]: developments driving speciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under those models, the tropics may be an
area of active speciation with high
[SPEAKER_02]: extinction rates, where you would expect
most of the diversity to be more recent in
[SPEAKER_02]: origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of broadly called a cradle
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can represent that
phylogenetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under a museum model, if we think back
through the Cenozoic from the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the K-T boundary or the K-P-G
boundary, under a museum model,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd expect common ancestors of our
species in general to sort of coalesce
[SPEAKER_02]: going way back through the past 65 million
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas under a cradle model, we expect
very small branch lengths and more recent
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example of the cradle model was found
in the genus Inga.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Inga is a tree genus, about 300 tree
species, only found in neotropical
[SPEAKER_02]: forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the species are widely distributed
and morphologically very distinctive from
[SPEAKER_02]: one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toby Pennington, James Richardson,
and colleagues tried to work out a
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogeny and found that they couldn't
work out the phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was not enough phylogenetic
resolution, not enough genetic divergence
[SPEAKER_02]: among the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they placed the genus phylogeny into
the broader legume phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And estimated that the genus arose 6 to 10
million years ago, with two-thirds of the
[SPEAKER_02]: species originating during Quaternary,
which was consistent with sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleistocene refuge hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they suggested that, you know,
this may be the case with most Amazon tree
[SPEAKER_02]: species, that most Amazon trees may
actually be very recent in origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my supervisor, post-doc, collaborated
at the time, and I were invited to write a
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective piece in science for this
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just didn't strike us as being very
realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason being is that, when we
think about the forests that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with in Barro Colorado Island and
Yasuni, there's a very deep taxonomic
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are there lots of species,
but at higher levels, the level of genus
[SPEAKER_02]: and families, there's also a lot of higher
level taxonomic diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, for example, in this Yasuni
forest, with our 1,100 tree species in a
[SPEAKER_02]: 25-hectare plot, there are 333 genera and
81 families of plants represented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can look at the distributions of
how many species there are per genus on
[SPEAKER_02]: the average.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 160 of those genera are
represented by a single species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of those genera are, in fact,
monotypic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many genera that only have a
single or one or two or three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're species poor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Inga is actually the extreme
outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a genus that has 43 species in this
forest plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this regard, Inga was something of
an outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the time I was doing
phylogeographic work, and I became
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in particular in widespread,
widely distributed species that were found
[SPEAKER_02]: both in Central America and in South
America, and also thinking about the age
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of some of these species' poor
genera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my first work was focused on
Symphonia globulifera.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a species in the Clusieaceae.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very distinctive in rainforests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I, as a graduate
student, I saw it frequently in Manaus,
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a postdoc, I saw it in Panama.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I visited French Guiana, I saw it in
forest plots there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it in Yasuni.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere I traveled, I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly enough, it's also very
common and widespread in Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very distinctive morphology,
which is very important, because when
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a thousand trees in a forest,
you want to be able to identify your
[SPEAKER_02]: species no matter which forest you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could always identify it through a
combination of characters, these aerial
[SPEAKER_02]: buttress, these aerial roots, and a sort
of bright orange latex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very distinctive globular flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another really useful point about
Symphonia, there's only one species of
[SPEAKER_02]: Symphonia found in the neotropics,
and it has a very distinctive pollen type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pollen has been used extensively
by the oil industry for stratigraphy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they want to find a character that
indicates that there's rainforest in a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular region or find the age of a
particular site, they often look for
[SPEAKER_02]: Symphonia pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually have a pretty good record
of the fossil distribution of Symphonia
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to other rainforest trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time that I was doing this
study, there were no phylogeographic
[SPEAKER_02]: studies of tropical plants, tropical
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that drew me to
phylogeography was traveling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to visit a lot of these
sites, visit forests that I hadn't seen
[SPEAKER_02]: before, collect Symphonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I relied on herbarium material to
fill in the gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got herbarium material from Africa and
from other locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used standard plant systematic
markers, ITS, chloroplast DNA,
[SPEAKER_02]: not knowing that these would even be
variable within this species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these show the sites that I visited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually based on ITS,
internal transcribed spacer sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of these colors represents a
distinct haplotype or sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these circles sort of show the
clustering of what were the related
[SPEAKER_02]: haplotypes occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an Amazonian group,
an area west of the Andes up through
[SPEAKER_02]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's highly diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It constitutes a clade, a West Indian
clade, and then this African group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shows the fossil history.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Symphonia fossil pollen first occurs
about 45 million years ago off the coast
[SPEAKER_02]: of Nigeria, so very old as a genus at
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first neotropical records are off the
coast of Brazil and in the Maracaibo basin
[SPEAKER_02]: in Venezuela at about 15 million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in Central America, we have the
first fossils appearing about eight
[SPEAKER_02]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just based on that fossil information
alone, we can infer that there had been
[SPEAKER_02]: some oceanic dispersal event that led to
the establishment of Symphonia in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon basin, sometime in the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the West Indies have always been
islands, and this is a very distinctive
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic group, this would have had to have
derived either from South America or from
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there had to have been,
assuming that there was no isthmus of
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama eight million years ago,
there had to have been dispersal from
[SPEAKER_02]: South America into Central America by
oceanic currents.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a phylogenetic reconstruction of
Symphonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the other species of Symphonia,
besides Symphonia globulifera,
[SPEAKER_02]: are found in Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about 20 species of Symphonia in
Madagascar, and then one species
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the Madagascan species,
and these are the clades within West
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, and then sister to this
neotropical group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a clade that's just sort of in
the Amazon region and Guiana Shield,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then one that's in the Trans-Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used the 15 million year fossils to sort
of calibrate this clade, and that gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: approximately seven million years of the
age of the Central American group,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is consistent with the fossil
record.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing to note about this is we have
this very high level of phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution and phylogenetic depth within a
single widespread species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this species is actually older than
the entire genus of Inga, which has 300
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a genus that it co-occurred with in
just about every forest, but it's a very
[SPEAKER_02]: old species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I published this work,
the editor of the journal said,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, this is really a living fossil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should sort of sell it as a living
fossil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just unchanged morphologically for such
a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other interesting thing was what it
revealed about oceanic dispersal leading
[SPEAKER_02]: to sort of the assembly patterns of these
forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously I had this great result,
and I wanted to see what I could learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about other widespread species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next one that I looked at was
Sabapentandra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, saba you might be familiar with is
the Kapok tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most enormous trees that
you'll find in the Amazon basin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a selfie taken by Robin Foster
back in about 1966 on BCI in Panama or
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tree just fell down last year,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called Big Tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's got these huge buttress
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got these little seeds that are
wrapped in sort of a cottony silk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very fast growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows up to two meters per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of establishes along riverbanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the largest ones are along the
Solomois River in the Amazon basin with
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient rich areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of natural history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love natural history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bat pollination of Simfonia,
a photo taken by a colleague of mine in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I found with Simfonia is a very
different pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using those same sets of molecular
markers, this is another haplotype map.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom part shows the chloroplast DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chloroplast DNA, using the most
variable chloroplast region, was entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: monomorphic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, no variation throughout
Central America, Amazon basin,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely no DNA sequence variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one nucleotide variant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the west coast of Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some ITS haplotypes,
but showing no phylogeographic pattern
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that the other species of
saba are located in the Amazon basin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several other species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the species likely originated in South
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got through long distance
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the oceanic currents arrived in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it arrived in Africa before
pre-Columbian times because there are
[SPEAKER_02]: records of Arab traders moving the species
in the 10th century into Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it naturally got into Africa,
but over a very recent time scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very weak phylogeographic structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably not a very old species in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I became well, okay, we have these
extreme cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one widespread species that's very
charismatic and well-known.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a very recent in origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have another one that's very
ancient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everywhere you go, it shows deep
phylogeographic breaks and divergence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to understand more about
these patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided to focus particularly on
looking at the Andean barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at populations that were
located on either side of the Andes in
[SPEAKER_02]: northern South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was reading the catalog of the
vascular plants of Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came across a quote by Peter Raven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he indicated that right when they were
tallying the plant diversity, they said
[SPEAKER_02]: that 30% of the plants found in lowland
rainforests in Ecuador are found on both
[SPEAKER_02]: sides of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that accounts, that's about 1,400
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said that about 30% of the lowland
flora has been around prior to the uplift
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that a large portion of
these ecological communities have been
[SPEAKER_02]: really stable for several millions of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Andes are several million
years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really interested in this idea
and thinking, wow, there must be large
[SPEAKER_02]: components that are very old in these
rainforest communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a situation known as
vicarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a widespread population and
then it's sort of broken up when a
[SPEAKER_02]: geographic barrier rises in the middle of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called vicarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that vicarians history would indicate
that these populations would have a
[SPEAKER_02]: Neogene age going back prior to the
Pleistocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have our northernmost Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the most recent part of the
Andes to form in Merida.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have been the final barrier
that would have been presented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the uplift of Merida Andes is about
2.7 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of right between where the Neogene
and the Quaternary are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a way to test this, I estimated
the ages of the ancestors of these
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they fell well within this Neogene
period, that would support Andean
[SPEAKER_02]: vicarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were well in the Quaternary,
that would indicate some kind of dispersal
[SPEAKER_02]: to get around the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to note that not only are
the Andes important as an elevational
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier, but also right beside the Andes,
you have this really dry area,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Onos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so any plant that is able to get
around the Andes is going to have to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: in some way with drought, with drying,
dry habitats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had 14 study species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were dealt with in individual
case studies, were sampled much more
[SPEAKER_02]: broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for all the species, I at least
sampled in Panama, western Ecuador,
[SPEAKER_02]: and eastern Ecuador, using these same sets
of molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that included Sabapentandra,
Symphonia globulifera, as well as some
[SPEAKER_02]: other species that are fairly well known,
like Okroma, which is the balsa
[SPEAKER_02]: wood-producing tree, Jacaranda,
well known for its flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also looked at, actually a student
of mine, Jordan Bemels, looked at some
[SPEAKER_02]: functional traits associated with these
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he looked at drought tolerance through
ecological niche modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at where these species were
found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, like Symphonia globulifera,
were only found in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wettest forests, true rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas others were found in drier forest
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were found in seasonally dry forest,
indicating they had more drought-tolerant
[SPEAKER_02]: abilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at some other characters,
functional traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the results were that nine out of the
14 species had a Neogene-aged population
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had population histories that went
back before 3 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these species had much
morphological variation, despite these
[SPEAKER_02]: deep temporal divergences among these
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also noticed that there was this
association, the species that did manage
[SPEAKER_02]: to somehow get around the Andes during the
Quaternary, those tend to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought-tolerant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're currently looking at more
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 85 species altogether that are
shared between the BCI and the Yassini
[SPEAKER_02]: forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're using other molecular markers,
particularly RadSeq DNA, to analyze these
[SPEAKER_02]: divergences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this figure just gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes back through this 10 million
year history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see here's the age for our
cross-Andean divergence of Symphonia
[SPEAKER_02]: globulifera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even the oldest species.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several species that have higher
levels of genetic divergence between their
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-Andean populations than Symphonia
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this group particular down here
that's very old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a couple species that are
sort of the Pliocene-Pliocene boundary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a group that definitely
seemed to have their origin in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Quaternary or sort of younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see some of the things that
species like Symphonia have experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've experienced warmth, global warmth,
warmer temperatures than are expected for
[SPEAKER_02]: the year 2100 with global climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've experienced the uplift of the
Andes, the development of the Merida
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes, the closure of the Isthmus of
Panama.
[SPEAKER_02]: These have been species that have been
part of a rainforest for all this period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just shows this sort of how the
drought-tolerant and intolerant species
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of segregate out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the youngest species are
drought-tolerant, indicating that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: that had played a role in allowing them to
get around the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Andes is really a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of lets the drought-tolerant
species through, but it keeps the
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest specialists on either side and
separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't Alfred Russell Wallace's
quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just to say that alongside
species like Inga, which definitely do
[SPEAKER_02]: represent recent diversification in a kind
of a cradle mode, there are many living
[SPEAKER_02]: fossil lineages, many lineages that are
just hanging out in the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been around the Andes for millions
of years without much notable
[SPEAKER_02]: morphological or ecological divergence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so where do the Andes fit in?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen how they fit in as a barrier,
but they actually contribute a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more to neotropical plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have our original photo,
and here we have the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are estimated 45,000 plants
species in the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: 44% of those are endemic to the Andean
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge amount of the overall
contribution of neotropical plant
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity that's localized on the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are many, many important
linkages geologically between the Amazon
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've explored these a lot recently in
collaboration with geologists who will
[SPEAKER_02]: dispute every point that I bring up today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the time being, I find this a very
reasonable scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a review paper by Karina Horn from
back in 2010, and it shows the Cenozoic
[SPEAKER_02]: development of the Amazon basin,
even before there was an Amazon River.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the very beginning of the Cenozoic,
65 to 33 million years ago, the Amazon
[SPEAKER_02]: drainage sort of moved in this direction,
and it actually flowed probably out
[SPEAKER_02]: through where the Orinoco River is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that there's not the alpine
habitat that would be in red, so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not much montane habitat at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just slowly developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as the Andes are uplifting,
particularly these northern Andes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're causing these drainage patterns to
shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're causing, at one point,
shift northward, at one point develop a
[SPEAKER_02]: large wetland system, until finally they
force the drainage to move eastward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have the development of a modern
Amazon River at about 10 million years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the continued rising up of the
Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the Andes raise up, all of a
sudden, it changes the climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds new precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rain shadow effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of moisture now newly
available in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also changes global circulation
patterns of air as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also changing the Amazon basin in
a very important way by adding
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient-rich sediments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first time, these are very
ancient cratons that are sandy and not
[SPEAKER_02]: very nutrient-rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, you have these new parent
material rising up and depositing all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of sediments into this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's changing ecosystem properties like
carbon flux as well, as well as promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: different kind of ecological niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, over the Quaternary,
we have the development of the Llanos,
[SPEAKER_02]: this dry area, and then all of the climate
changes that are associated with the ice
[SPEAKER_02]: ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of biogeographic processes,
I've discussed a lot about how the Andes
[SPEAKER_02]: work as a barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a barrier to up to 30% of the
rainforest species in Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: It acts as a corridor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particularly for temperate zone species to
actually move into this region in northern
[SPEAKER_02]: South America and potentially most of them
are residing in this region and speciating
[SPEAKER_02]: when they get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them actually do move into the
lowlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's acting as a speciation
pump or a cradle of diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, the alpine habitats have seen
an incredible amount of diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that with these new sediments
that were formed in the slopes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes, I think that also promoted some
diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that may be where we have Inga
playing out because Inga has its center of
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution as a genus on sort of this
slope of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great review paper by Lubert and
Wigand that came out recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been a lot of phylogenetic
studies of clades in the Andean region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a synthesis of these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tried to place all the ones that
had any kind of age estimates associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with them into context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they associated them with different
regions of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they separate the Andes into a northern
region, sort of a north central and
[SPEAKER_02]: central Andean region, and the southern
Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are progressively younger as you
move north, southern Andes being
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially the oldest part of the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you kind of squint your eyes and
don't apply statistics, you can see that
[SPEAKER_02]: the southern Andes do have quite a lot of
older lineages with ancestors that go back
[SPEAKER_02]: into the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the northern Andean clades,
there actually are a lot that seem to have
[SPEAKER_02]: their origin in the Quaternary or the
Pliocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is potentially possible that we'd be
able to sort of find this association with
[SPEAKER_02]: the age of the mountain and the age of the
clades that are associated with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a project that I recently began
participating in in this past year with a
[SPEAKER_02]: group of geologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had funding from NSF, from
Frontiers and Earth System Dynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal of it, there were geologists
who were really interested in the Amazon
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiversity and how it was generated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also know a lot about Andean
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to get together a group of
people that were experts in Andean uplift
[SPEAKER_02]: geomorphology, paleoclimatology,
contemporary climates, ecosystem function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really wanted somebody that could
contribute in terms of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: phylogenetic history or phylogeographic
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been meeting together regularly
and talking about these patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some questions we have in the plant
side are, we want to know, what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification that we see in Andean
clades?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that because these plants migrated
into new habitat that was very open and
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't exist before and they just
immediately started occupying these novel
[SPEAKER_02]: habitats?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, as some people have suggested,
is it because these habitats are kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like islands?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these mountaintops are like islands so
that whenever you have climate change,
[SPEAKER_02]: these islands grow and sometimes coalesce
and then shrink back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this would be a kind of Pleistocene
refuge model applied to the tops of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to know, what is driving that
diversification?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what are the major drivers of
the diversification apart from allopatry
[SPEAKER_02]: with respect to ecological niche,
important ecological traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, Al Gentry suggested that the
ability to move into hummingbird
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination opened up a lot of ecological
space for high elevation plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as genomic evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what is the contribution of the
Andean-associated species with lowland
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest diversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about Inga, to what extent did
this cradle of diversification impact
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazonian flora?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually will be gathering our own
data pretty soon, starting this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over the past few months, what we've
done is we've gone into the literature and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done a meta-analysis of existing
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is done in collaboration with
Stephen Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get a Gmail from him,
this is how his face appears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who knows him knows that
that's exactly what he looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just like a beard in black
glasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is his undergraduate student,
Carolyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been actually getting to do all the
work of developing scripts to pull out DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: sequences from GenBank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Analyze them in large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done these diversification
analyses that are based on techniques that
[SPEAKER_02]: were developed by Dan Robosky,
who is actually a PhD student here very
[SPEAKER_02]: recently at the Laboratory of Ornithology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any questions about this, he'll be
giving a talk here in Cornell in a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please hold your questions for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of mathematical magic that
happens in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what this shows is a phylogenetic tree
with sort of a heat map.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows when you have changes or
significant shifts in the rate of
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diversification being sort of the
speciation rate minus the extinction rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the net impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here we have a fast rate of
diversification, slowing down and then
[SPEAKER_02]: showing a significant slowdown,
for example, in this clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have the Andean clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the common ancestor of the Andean
group, which is shown here with this green
[SPEAKER_02]: dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually no evidence for any
change in the diversification rate when
[SPEAKER_02]: this group reaches the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the kind of thing that we're
looking at with this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And blue being slow rate of
diversification, yellow, medium,
[SPEAKER_02]: red is a rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that example that I showed you there
was Berberus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be familiar with Japanese
Barberry, which is invasive in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this genus reached the Andes,
it did speciate, but not in any rate that
[SPEAKER_02]: was different from the background rate of
speciation in other geographic regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the classic papers and
really important paper in sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: explosive diversification patterns in the
Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in the genus Lupinus in the
Lupins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you can see the geographic
distribution of these Lupins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as they hit the Andes,
represented in orange, you see very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very short branch lengths and lots of
species, similar to that Inga tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very recent explosive phylogenetic
diversification, accompanied by incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification at the morphological
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are some of the plants that
evolved during that radiation,
[SPEAKER_02]: including everything from herbaceous to
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: This all evolved within a quaternary time
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the fastest diversification rates
that were measured for plants or animals
[SPEAKER_02]: were published in that paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at, we pull out all the
sequences from GenBank for the Lupins.
[SPEAKER_02]: From all over the world, we put them in a
phylogenetic tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see that across all Lupins,
there are some areas, and some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: might be affected by sample size as well,
that are slower evolving or more quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we have our Andean group right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that there's really no
evidence for any significant rate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lupins evolved very rapidly in the Andes,
but they were already evolving very
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly in the Rocky Mountains,
already evolving very rapidly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they were in the Andes,
they just continued to evolve very
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in all fairness, the authors do
recognize that in the subsequent paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a general pattern of Lupin
biology, not necessarily something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: specific to the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drabba is a group that does show a strong
signature of Andean diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compared to all the taxa that are
outside of the Andes, when it hits the
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes, it has a significantly increased
rate of diversification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Festuca is another one that shows a strong
signature of Andean diversification,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also see that it shows a
significant slowdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it diversified initially very quickly
compared to the rest of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the clade of Festuca,
but then diversification rate slowed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this would indicate to me that
potentially this is a group that
[SPEAKER_02]: diversified initially as these plants came
into the novel habitat, but they weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily affected by the climatic
fluctuations of the Pleistocene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Valeriana shows a similar pattern where it
showed a significant increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: diversification initially, followed by a
slowdown to the present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial results of this
meta-analysis, that there's quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some groups come in, they speciate to some
degree, not any different from the
[SPEAKER_02]: background level speciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some groups come in and show real rampant
radiations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them show radiations and then
stasis coming into more recent time
[SPEAKER_02]: scales, indicating that probably my
hypothesis is that they're diversifying
[SPEAKER_02]: initially as they reach these new
habitats, but they're not terribly
[SPEAKER_02]: impacted by Pleistocene climate changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the future works.
[SPEAKER_02]: My colleague Stephen Smith's really
interested in incorporating as much data,
[SPEAKER_02]: ecological data as is possible into these
analyses, including biogeographic data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to look at, excuse me,
the ecological correlates of these rate
[SPEAKER_02]: increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to also do more
transcriptomic work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to look at the genus Clusia,
which is in the Clusiasi.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the only tree lineages that
has cam photosynthesis, which allows it to
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesize in very dry periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a combination of C3 and cam
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a genus that shows high levels
of species turnover, as you move up slopes
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're interested in looking at the
evolution of that photosynthetic mechanism
[SPEAKER_02]: and how some of these may have impacted
evolutionary divergences within the Andes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also interested in working with
the geologists to better pull together
[SPEAKER_02]: geological history with the plant
phylogenetic history.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, biologists have been
working for a long time thinking that some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the high elevation habitats like the
Paramo are a certain age, a maximum of
[SPEAKER_02]: five million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these geologists say that the ages of
the eastern and western cordieres of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Andes are very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the western parts of the Andes,
which are sort of a volcanic origin as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to origin by faulting,
that these might have a much deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to see if we can find clades
that are much deeper in age than five
[SPEAKER_02]: million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to particularly thank Stephen
and Carolyn, my graduate student Jordan,
[SPEAKER_02]: and postdoc Ashley Thompson, and my
geological geogenomics colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be happy to take any questions.
So at one point, you mentioned genomic
correlates.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in answering this
question, I'd like to elaborate a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more on what you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing that Stephen is doing now
is developing high-logerase based on
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he'll take the transcribed genes that
might be 16,000 of them from a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then perform polygenetic analyses of
those various genetic groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look to see that there are
certain genes that are popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are evolving much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fewer branch lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that might be one way to sort of
get at what are the actual functions that
[SPEAKER_01]: are evolving more quickly than others in
some of these groups that might precede
[SPEAKER_01]: diversification or enable transmoving in
the geological space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be one aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about things like looking at the
living fossil lineages versus the more
[SPEAKER_05]: dispersed lineages for rates of change?
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anything been done with those,
like here in Symphonia, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing that I'm very interested
in is looking below the surface of species
[SPEAKER_01]: like Symphonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I find it hard to believe that in
such a biologically challenging
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, such as a tropical forest,
there are huge amounts of pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, pathogens, insect damage,
constantly, that there wouldn't be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of evolution happening that may have to do
with secondary defense or other traits
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're just not seeing in taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that would be very interesting
to look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last few examples you presented of a
rare risk, a stupid, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_06]: in relative rate changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speciation events.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if there is a higher level
pattern of the infectious and woody in
[SPEAKER_06]: that they fall out in these categories
initially, and then you're looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: patterns moving in each category.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll need to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just the initial results now,
but it's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're all on the same scale then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not sure if some of those
groups, and as certainly with the Lutens
[SPEAKER_01]: or some woody elements, they're,
and I'm not sure if that applies to the
[SPEAKER_01]: others, but there are risk of your
patients more of woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how that affected their speciation
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would expect there to be less
illiterate rate for the woody for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, but it gives them longer
generation times and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking for the checks to be on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a more general and maybe naive
question about a species diversification,
[SPEAKER_03]: but after something like a lot of long
distance dispersal event, you might expect
[SPEAKER_03]: that species to diversify when it reaches
its new ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you also see a drop in species
diversity of species that were already
[SPEAKER_03]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of like the species that has come
from far away is an invasive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does that impact the ecosystem it
moves to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think there aren't too many cases
where we have a long distance dispersal
[SPEAKER_01]: event where a species arrives into an
already species rich environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: diversifies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the case of the Andean region,
I think a lot of packs are arriving there
[SPEAKER_01]: and then entering in an occupied space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very able to diversify just like
through the islands, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: diversification without too much
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point, there may be a point
where there's no longer much space to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave because there's a certain carrying
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the dispersal events that I
mentioned, there was never, apart from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Andean colonization, there was never much
speciesation happening along this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least non-graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you calibrate those
meta-analyses that you just showed us?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those meta-analyses don't have any kind
of calibration on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just looking at the sphere
based on the numbers of nodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the relative weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't really try to put the ages
on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably wouldn't trust any kind
of age estimates that you would put on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not enough of a fossil record
for this taxon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just show whether there's an increase
in the rate or an increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, some of these methods are
dependent on taxonomic sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how extensively the sampling is
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many limitations of this kind
of analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to just sort of understand
what those limitations are and what
[SPEAKER_01]: questions we can address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the more recently diversifying
species, do they still cross-hybridize and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce hybrid progenies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm only very familiar with the
ginga.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those species, to my knowledge,
are very morphologically distinct and
[SPEAKER_01]: without too many intermediates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also tend to have widespread
overlapping distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as if they speciated in small
acylated valleys and then haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somehow they manage to speciate and
then develop reproductive barriers to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop wider overlapping distributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the other groups, other than the
Andes, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know in that case, it's because.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you have a population that's widely
distributed and then have it interrupted
[SPEAKER_06]: by the Andes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you rule out dispersal over the Andes
to account for the similarities between
[SPEAKER_06]: the two components?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the main question is,
like with that, Peter Raven sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested this as a sort of a like-haring
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the Andes just divided the
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the alternative hypothesis is some
kind of dispersal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would be nice to do would be to
get enough taxons to just determine
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's been the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some relatively low areas in
the Andes in the 2000 meters where
[SPEAKER_01]: conceivably in some form or periods of
time there could have been some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: dispersal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There also could have been dispersal in
that sort of what is now beyond those sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of along the slopes of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, like in the case of Centanovia
and Ceba, you have a chance to have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: around to a shamanic currents as well
before the isthmus came along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always the alternative dispersal
versus afterness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it'd be difficult for them to
get over the Andes for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real strong analogical barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens when you start nesting
species where genera into higher taxon in
[SPEAKER_04]: your analysis?
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, do you find, let's say at
the family level, that some families are
[SPEAKER_04]: prone to rapid diversification and slow
diversification?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's always this idea is there
something intrinsic to a clade's genomic
[SPEAKER_04]: potential to morphologically diversify?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm starting to think about legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in what people are going to
say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the lupines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the pina.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legumes are a dominant family of trees
in the rainforest around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there might be certain groups that
really can diversify for some reason or
[SPEAKER_01]: for some reason or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to do their reproductive biology
for, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, nodulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have to demonstrate coordination.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to figure out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm surprised the ugly word poly
community hasn't come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gene diversification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did come up earlier, you know,
when I had the... We didn't talk enough
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was a very interesting
looking at the morphology as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was especially looking for,
is genomic correlation.
That explanation did not escape me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
