[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, thank you very much to the
graduate students of plant breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to give a seminar to
colleagues here on the Ithaca campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's especially nice to be invited by
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faculty love that, so it is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I apologize that I missed lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought lunch was after the seminar,
because that's what we do in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you had a great lunch without
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit sad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess there's food in Michael
Mazurik's lab that I can snag afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to break a bunch of rules
that I give my graduate students when I
[SPEAKER_00]: help them develop their seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first rule being you should never talk
about more than one pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets too confusing, and everyone
gets confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the title, A Tale of Two
Phytophthora, you can get the idea that I
[SPEAKER_00]: am going to be talking about two
pathosystems today, and we'll see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the symptoms that you see on the title
slide here are symptoms of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the left-hand side is phytophthora
blight caused by phytophthora capsici.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the center and on the right-hand
side, you see phytophthora infestans,
[SPEAKER_00]: which causes late blight of potato and
tomato, which is infamous for being the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen involved in the Irish potato
famine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I really got into the projects,
I did want to mention a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other projects ongoing in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case any of you folks are interested,
I'd be happy to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a vegetable pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is to study all of those diseases
that occur above ground on vegetables in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there seems to be more and more every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of years, I worked on bacterial
and whole mycete pathogens, and we still
[SPEAKER_00]: have some bacterial projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work a lot on cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabbage is a major vegetable crop grown
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tomato also, bacterial speck and
bacterial canker.
[SPEAKER_00]: In bacterial canker, we have some
interesting projects looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of the pathogen within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, as Lauren said, a lot on pathogen
detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then population studies today,
I'll talk about phytophthora capsici and
[SPEAKER_00]: infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, as again Lauren said, we also work
on cucurbit downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in recent years, I've started
some projects on the true fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Alternaria Leaf Spot on brassica
crops, Brown Leaf Mold on tomato,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hits high tunnel tomatoes
particularly hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the newest project in my lab is
Malampsera Rust Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's willow rust on shrub willow,
which is now a vegetable in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also do a lot of work with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend about half of my time working with
growers and helping them manage and
[SPEAKER_00]: control their diseases in both
conventional and organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very large outreach program to
the general public, including home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners, community gardens, and K to 12
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our local K to 12 project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help the elementary school with their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this semester, I'm teaching a
course called Skills for Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto the phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, we have phytophthora blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, we have late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think that they're very similar
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look pretty similar in culture while
they grow on different media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms you see here, both on this
tomato leaf and on this pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the asexual spores of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both pathogens are oomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not true fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't call them true fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in an entirely different kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they look in culture like
a true fungus, they're really very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different type of organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring out some of those differences
as the talk goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The host range of the two pathogens is
really quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first area that really
separates the two out here in New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora capsicii has a much broader
host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it attacks all cucurbits, almost all of
the solanaceous crops, but not potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: snap beans, and a whole diverse array of
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of the symptoms showing
fruit rots here on the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be using this so people in Geneva
can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right-hand side is the host
range of phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a much more limited host
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big ones are potato and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes to petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nightshade weeds, all these
solanaceous guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotiana benthamiana is a popular lab rat
for P. infestans work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within the solanaceous,
it does not attack pepper or eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fact that infestans doesn't
attack pepper or eggplant and capsicii
[SPEAKER_00]: does not attack potato is really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the areas that I'd
really like to study over the next 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was talking to some breeders
about this, and someone actually told me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it broke my heart, but someone actually
told me, please, please, please don't show
[SPEAKER_00]: us those darn life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally care, but I get that you
guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show you the
highlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more, come see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some really important aspects
of the life cycles in New York of both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each pathogen is heterothalic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you need two mating types in
order to make the sexual overwintering
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cleverly call the mating types A1
and A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each mating type can make both the male
and female parts, but you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those mating types in order to get
the overwintering sexual spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: With phytophthora capsicii, every field we
tested has both mating types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a sexually reproducing
overwintering population throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: In phytophthora infestans, the late blight
pathogen, this is a very clonal population
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, while in Mexico and other parts
of the world, both mating types exist and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have sexually reproducing populations,
here in the US, our populations are
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any given year, we'll have one or two
or three clonal lineages that predominate
[SPEAKER_00]: the epidemics that we see, but we don't
only rarely see, only rarely do we see
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have O spores in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So capsicii, life cycle, it overwinters in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infestans, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So asexual reproduction is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora, the direct translation is
plant destroyer, and the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthoras are such excellent plant
destroyers is because of their explosive
[SPEAKER_00]: asexual reproduction capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are sporangia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what, that white fuzz on the
tomato leaf or that powdered sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the asexual sporangia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the right conditions, each
sporangium will produce zoospores that can
[SPEAKER_00]: swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capsicii, when these guys get wet,
will produce 20 to 40 swimming zoospores,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas infestans, that'll be six to
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoospores are incredibly interesting
structures, and I won't bore you with
[SPEAKER_00]: immense amount of details, but there are a
couple of cool things that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoospores, on their abaxial surface,
they have two flagella, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: biflagellate, which makes them unique
among many modal spores in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're biflagellate, and the anterior
flagellum is actually tinsulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the posterior is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anterior flagellum actually pulls the
zoospore forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most swimming spores, you have a
flagellum, and it acts like a tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it moves along, but that is totally
not how these guys work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the front crawl, and that
posterior flagellum actually acts as a
[SPEAKER_00]: rudder, and in some species, they're
chemotactic, so that rudder can direct
[SPEAKER_00]: them directly to the root zone,
where they want to attack and kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh my seeds are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do they spread?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I talk about capsicii, being that
it's in the soil, it spreads in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: with movement of soil, and with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my seeds, the common name would be a
water mold, and these guys really do love
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capsicii will move wherever water moves
it, and wherever someone moves the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, there is no aerial dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot move through the air,
and that is really one of the Achilles
[SPEAKER_00]: heel of this pathogen that enables us to
manage it at all in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capsicii, as I said, it can move in water,
whether it's splash dispersal of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: flood waters, and then on soil,
cultivation between fields, and on
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of infected fruit, which is a
very common way that it gets moved from
[SPEAKER_00]: farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infestans is all about that aerial
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of a tomato leaf,
and you see the sporangia on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these tiny, lemon-shaped guys,
and they actually stick up off the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, and when the humidity changes,
so for example, if I had a detached
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflet in a petri dish, high humidity,
took that lid off, you decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, the sporangia actually twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They twist, and they de-hiss, or they
break off from the sporangia floor on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, and that's how they become airborne,
and they can fly for miles in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methods of dispersal of these two
pathogens are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the infestans, because it's aerially
dispersed and it's not in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: then how does it survive here in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it tends to survive over winter in
potato tubers, so the pathogen can live
[SPEAKER_00]: inside that tuber that might be left in
the soil or sitting in a coal pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can get around by movement of
infected plants, tubers fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sadly by humans, sometimes in trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw in 2009, many of your tomatoes
may have died from laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was due to movement of infected
tomato transplants in trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I have to do
every year as part of my job is when there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a total crop failure, as is seen with
phytophthora capsicidae on this acorn
[SPEAKER_00]: squash here on the left, or with this
potato field and phytophthora infestans on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right, I tend to get called out by the
extension educators to the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to the grower, try to figure out what
went wrong, how we can fix it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm standing there trying to
educate, but I get paid whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: their crop dies, and this person is
dealing with a significant economic loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I have come to
realize is that it's after these
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences of interacting with growers
after significant crop loss, on that drive
[SPEAKER_00]: home, that's when I really tend to come up
with the questions that my lab is focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the questions, many of the questions in
my lab are really driven by crop failures
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field and trying to figure out what
can we do to study and find out more
[SPEAKER_00]: information to prevent this into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of the questions that I'm
going to cover today with phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: capsicidae, which has both sexual and
asexual reproduction in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions that growers always ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will be heartened to know that no
matter the disease, growers, almost the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing they ask is, are there
resistant varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your work is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please continue to breed resistant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in terms of phytophthora capsicidae,
phytophthora blight, what happens when the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen arrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it on my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me it's mine to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will the pathogen stay in the
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really commonly asked question,
is the pathogen resistant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides that I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And will the pathogen be able to overcome
that host resistance that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: With phytophthora infestans, because the
pathogen really doesn't survive on farm
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're keeping tubers that you
shouldn't be keeping, the common questions
[SPEAKER_00]: are, what strain of the pathogen do I
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have these asexual clonal
lineages, people want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what strain do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know based on the clonal
lineage, does it prefer potato or tomato?
[SPEAKER_00]: What fungicides is it resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That clonal lineage gives us some
information about that strain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there resistant varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what about fungicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the pathogen come from every
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a question that advisory panels
ask, growers ask, where does this come
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, again, will the pathogen be able
to overcome host resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with phytophthora infestans,
sadly, there is a very long history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen relatively quickly overcoming
host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with our sexually
reproducing phytophthora capsicidae that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes phytophthora blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a little series on
phytophthora blight now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working on phytophthora blight
in 2006 because there had been several
[SPEAKER_00]: large outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen had been in New York for
decades, but just a small problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: upstate New York with significant problems
down on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, starting in 2004, 2005,
there was some really big epidemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is because around
that time, we started to have a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: our climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than having a quarter inch of rain
a week throughout the summer, we got large
[SPEAKER_00]: rain events that Art Degatano calls
extreme weather events where we would get
[SPEAKER_00]: two or more inches of rain at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a water mold, you can imagine that
if you get two or more inches of rain at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time, flooding and puddling in fields,
those water molds go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get an outbreak on one or two
farms, then because the pathogen moves in
[SPEAKER_00]: water and in diseased fruit and on tractor
tires, it really starts to spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have learned since we started
working on it is that, as I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have sexually reproducing populations
in every field in New York that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen is very genetically diverse,
which is not surprising given that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sexually reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are regional differences in
fungicide sensitivity, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the eastern side of New York,
we have some fungicide resistance to a
[SPEAKER_00]: very commonly used fungicide, whereas in
the western part of New York, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a significant survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a student work on trying to figure
out what surface waters in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I talk to their capsicum, could be
found in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she could find it almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation ponds, streams, the Erie Canal,
which people use for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any irrigation source, we could find
the pathogen present in floodwaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A boy after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurricane remnants from Irene and Lee and
then Superstorm Standee.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were many, many farms in eastern New
York that had never had phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: capsicum before that now have the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned something about resistance
working with Michael Mazurek in his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some pepper varieties are
resistant to New York isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on getting more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is currently no commercially
available resistance in cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, along with Michael Mazurek and
Mike Gore, we're working on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to identify some resistance in the
cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes out some of our questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the questions still remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the pathogen arrives
into a new field that had never been
[SPEAKER_00]: infected before?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long will that pathogen stay in
the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the really interesting things
about this project is that the growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of New York, especially upstate,
were really wanting someone at Cornell to
[SPEAKER_00]: study phytophthora capsicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meg McGrath down on Long Island has done a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soils are different there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is different there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one on either the Ithaca or Geneva
campuses had been working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons is that none of
Cornell's land was infested with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out that those horticultural
scientists and plant breeders aren't that
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastic about the plant pathologist
inoculating our Cornell land with a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen that has an extremely broad host
range that never goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers actually worked together
with legislators in Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a blight farm built in Geneva,
New York, about a quarter of a mile from
[SPEAKER_00]: my office, which is totally awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were nine acres of very swampy land
that Cornell was happy to have me use for
[SPEAKER_00]: a blight farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an aerial photo of it there on
the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an outline of the blight farm
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of pepper trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a shout out to the Mazurik
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of Mazurik's peppers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the pathogen survives in the
soil, you don't want to use the equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant breeders and the
horticultural scientists might use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have equipment, a barn, anything
that we might need to do trials on our
[SPEAKER_00]: nine acre farm is part of the farm,
stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we have been doing
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that soil did not have any of the
pathogen in it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you inoculate a farm with a
pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not actually that much
scientific literature on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we searched.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2008, we came up with this idea
that thankfully worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew two different strains of the
pathogen, the A1 and the A2, the two
[SPEAKER_00]: mating types, in big five liter flasks
that were filled with vermiculite that had
[SPEAKER_00]: been saturated with V8 juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pathogen loves V8 juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, I think we had 50 flasks of
each isolate growing in sterile conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and inoculated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took those and we mixed them
up in these very scientific plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took that cocktail and spread it
around this beautiful, beautiful pumpkin
[SPEAKER_00]: patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an absolutely gorgeous pumpkin
patch on September 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And October 9th, we had victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to admit that while I truly hate
seeing this on a grower farm, on our
[SPEAKER_00]: research farm, this is absolute victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were really excited and happy that
we had killed this pumpkin patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plant breeders and
horticultural scientists were a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous when they saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were thankful that we were on our
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the start of a bi-parental
population that we have studied over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Maren Carlson's slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just absolutely fantastic to
demonstrate what we're looking at in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our victory field here on the
left that was inoculated with the A1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the A2 strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2008, it was inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring of 2009 is the
first time we started to collect isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect isolates by planting a
susceptible host in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring some of that diseased tissue in,
culture the pathogen, and that's how we
[SPEAKER_00]: get the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tricky thing is we really don't know
the generation of the pathogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those O-spores can survive in the
field for a very long time, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: an F1 O-spore from the first year
germinate and mate with an O-spore that
[SPEAKER_00]: was produced in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really don't know anything about
who's mating with whom after that first
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we doing in our bi-parental
field population?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, one of the things we really wanted
to ask was how long will a founding
[SPEAKER_00]: O-spore population survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we observe generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we observe generations over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there selfing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we did this was we collected
somewhere between 30 and 50 isolates each
[SPEAKER_00]: year from 2009 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning, my graduate student,
Amara Dunn, used microsatellite analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a paper from South Africa that
had five microsatellite loci, which
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkably was more than enough for us to
identify variation in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: She saw variation in genotypes,
irregular patterns of inheritance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not unusual for the genus
Phytophthora, and appearance of novel
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles within three years, novel
microsatellite alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did an F1 cross in the lab to use
as a control to know what an F1 population
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we knew that we needed more than five
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you need more markers,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, since that time, Maren Carlson took
over the project, and we have 157
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals from the field, 43 individuals
from our F1 lab cross, and we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome of Phytophthora capsici is
about 64 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used APEK1, which seemed to work fine
for our purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people that are working with
Phytophthora find that APEK1 doesn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: them enough cut sites, but it was fine for
our purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maren was able to identify about 400,000
SNPs before filtering, and after her
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering, we're now using about 6,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Maren's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the A1 parent in blue up on the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the A2 parent on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a principal components analysis
with those 6,500 SNPs, and what you see is
[SPEAKER_00]: different colored dots ranging from 2009
to 2013, which is how far we've gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: date, and then in magenta are the products
of the lab cross that we know are F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happily, we saw sort of what we
expected to see, more or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a bi-parental population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progeny are somewhere in between the
two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of interesting
individuals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually three individuals from
the lab cross that Mara, my previous
[SPEAKER_00]: student, had identified with the five loci
to be selfed, and Maren found the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these were two that had not been
previously identified, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually individuals from the field that
are also identified as selves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one parent mating with itself
because in the heterothalicomycete,
[SPEAKER_00]: each individual can produce both the
oogonium, the female part, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: antheridium, the male part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can self, and so that's how we got
those individuals out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maren has done some really interesting
work on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purposes of this seminar,
what we were really looking for was how
[SPEAKER_00]: long do those original founding oospores
stay in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have in this violin plot is our
F1s on the right hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they're F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we were able to collect
isolates was 2009, and so in 2009 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, the heterozygosity, which is what
you're looking at here, was very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we saw with F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in 2011, this is really great,
what we see is that there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that have a level of
heterozygosity similar to that of the F1s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we're starting to see some
individuals that have less heterozygosity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be an indicator of inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we also see is as we move into 2012
and 2013, is again a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygosity, so we're looking at
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this isn't really surprising,
this is actually the first time that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to show this for a field
population of phytophthora capsicidae,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's really kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really fun to see what happens in
the next several years if we continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a reduction in heterozygosity or if it
levels off, because we are selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: those individuals that can kill a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only can collect isolates on a plant
that is dying from symptoms, so because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're selecting, we're probably losing
individuals that are no longer pathogenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it'll be interesting to see what
happens in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we learned from our GBS with the
biparental population?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found that the founding oospores
stay for about three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on Marin's work, there are
individuals that appear to be F1s for
[SPEAKER_00]: about three years, and the inbred oospores
are there for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens when it arrives,
and that's also how long we think the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen will stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because of selection, we don't know
that this is exactly what would happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower's field, but we do hope to
compare these data to what we see in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower's field as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next with the phytophthora
capsicidae, which has the sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need additional studies on the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Marin is doing a lot of really
fascinating additional studies on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics of this by biparental population.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, phytophthora capsicidae
is known to have interesting genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's actually able to use this population
to learn more about loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygosity, gene conversion,
and it's really been fun to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the pathogen in this field setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we also want to compare our
research field to grower fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, there are more than enough grower
fields for us to compare to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marin is actually doing an association
study to look for a region associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: mating type, but there are other
phenotypes that we will certainly want to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for in the future, such as fungicide
resistance or effectors that enable the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen to more effectively attack the
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now going to switch gears and talk
about asexual reproduction for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whole new system, similar yet
completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're switching to P. infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aerially dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been studying phytophthora
infestans for 165 years, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most feared pathogens of tomato
and potato growers across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a frustrating system to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers are frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest questions that the
first question a grower asks is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what strain do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, because these are
asexually propagated, you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to know what strain do I have,
because that will help them know what
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides to use, what host to plant,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there resistant varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the pathogen resistant to commonly used
fungicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the pathogen come from every
year, if it's not coming from our soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, will the pathogen be able to
overcome the host resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are data from Bill Fry's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, as many of you know, is probably the
world expert in research on phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that Bill's lab has
studied for a very long time are these
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal lineages, these asexually
reproducing populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this slide shows is his ability to
identify quickly clonal lineages and the
[SPEAKER_00]: change in clonal lineages over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the potato graph we have
from 2009 to 2014, as we do in the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, each color is a different asexually
reproducing population or clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line from this slide is that
yes, clonal lineages change over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yes, we can fairly rapidly identify
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in 2011, we really had a boost in
our ability to understand what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with phytophthora infestans because a
large group of us, about 28 labs across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country, were involved in a USDA CAP
grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Fry's portion of that, one of his
projects as part of that, was that people
[SPEAKER_00]: from around the country sent phytophthora
infestans isolates to his lab and he
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyped them, using microsatellites,
he genotyped them within 24 hours and got
[SPEAKER_00]: that information back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was great for people because they
would know what clonal lineage they were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, but it was also great for us
because suddenly we had this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of isolates with which we could
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of the project, several labs
around the country also took that isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: collection and tested them for sensitivity
to commonly used fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the resistant varieties, there are
resistant varieties which the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently can overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, breeders are working,
especially in tomato, on increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really nice R genes in tomato
that are being bred into lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available varieties now,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question that remained that we
wanted to look at was where does the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen arrive from every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach Hanson, one of my graduate
students, has been working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we wanted to use some method to
understand if we could identify
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals within that asexual clonal
lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be mutations that occurred
over time through mitosis, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: asexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to know if we could identify
variation, and if so, could we identify
[SPEAKER_00]: sublineages or variants that we could
track across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we wanted to do this is
that we hoped that it will better enable
[SPEAKER_00]: us to understand how epidemics start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do they start from some source of
inoculum that's a potato tuber in a home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener's backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they starting from transplants that
get moved by truck or potato tuber seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets moved around the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this was part of our cap grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge community effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach looked at 257 isolates from four
different clonal lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clonal lineages are named, they started
with US1.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're named by the country that you
first identify them in, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: chronologically as new lineages come
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So US8 is the oldest lineage that we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It first appeared in the 1990s,
and we looked at also US11, US23,
[SPEAKER_00]: and US24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the isolates were from between
2011 and 2014, because that was the time
[SPEAKER_00]: period of the grant that we were working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were submitted to Bill's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He genotyped them, saved them away,
and those are the isolates that we used
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach was able to use APKs, APK1 again,
identify SNPs within lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we wanted to do was
look at the genetic differences within a
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypothesis would be that the oldest
lineage, US8, would have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of isolates within that lineage,
because it's been around the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Zach went through the culture
collection, we were able to get by far the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest number of isolates from the clonal
lineage US23.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is for the last three
years, that's almost the only lineage that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who sent in an isolate,
it's going to be US23.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had between 20 and 30 of the other
three lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here, after filtering,
the number of SNPs that were identified
[SPEAKER_00]: and used in these analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oldest lineage did have the
highest level of diversity but even that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really not, there's not a huge amount
of diversity as one might expect within a
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal lineage, but we did identify some
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did do an experiment where he used the
exact same isolate and performed GBS seven
[SPEAKER_00]: different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was sort of our background
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this .043 was the level of diversity
sort of within our control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of our background,
if it's not higher than that, we know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach also did a principal components
analysis on the entire group of 257
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully and happily, he was able to
differentiate the four clonal lineages
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was known prior to this study that the
two lineages US8 and US24 were fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that the system was working at
least at some level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to show today is actually
only the data from the US23 clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages because we had 166 isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really gave us the most
interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: With only 20 to 30 isolates, we really did
not have enough data to try to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: regional differences compared to annual
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the US23 isolates, in this
particular neighbor joining tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're categorized by collection year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really see very many yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009 was the first year that the clonal
lineage US23 was identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had two isolates from that
inaugural year, three isolates from 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that two of the three
isolates from 2010 clustered together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, because of this grant and
people sending isolates in, in 2011,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, 2013, and 2014, we had many more
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly, in 2011 and 2012,
the isolates are fairly evenly dispersed
[SPEAKER_00]: across the neighbor joining tree or up and
down the neighbor joining tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2013 and 2014, we could actually
see some grouping by year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these green isolates here in group A
are 11 isolates all collected in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were collected from these states,
Florida, Massachusetts, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: North Carolina, and Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while phytophthora and festans can fly
a long way, it's pretty unlikely that it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have the ability to fly from Florida
to Idaho in the average season of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potato or tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In group B, we had 14 isolates collected
from 2013, again, with a fairly wide
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging group of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we tried to categorize these by state
or region, we didn't come up with any
[SPEAKER_00]: groupings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we did these categories by year,
we came up with several groupings,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in just 166 isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems with this study is
that we don't have the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates from every year, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was really excited about these
initial data that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, we did not see any evidence
for geographic sublineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all of our inoculum was coming from
infected tubers or there's been a report
[SPEAKER_00]: that the seed in tomato fruit can house
phytophthora and festans over winter in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, so if all of our inoculum were
coming from local sources, we would expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to see regional geographic sublineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If inoculum were not coming from local
sources but was rather being moved around
[SPEAKER_00]: on seedlings or tubers or people,
then you might expect to see clustering by
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on these data, my current
hypothesis is that at least in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those cases, the pathogen is moving long
distances in a short period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what everyone has assumed,
that the pathogen can move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really interesting to have some
data to start to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, some of these individual
lines here, when we get more data,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might see both regional sublineages as
well as annual sublineages because the
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely scenario is that both regional
sources and trucked sources are moving
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last question, this is perfect,
in the last two minutes, the area that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be looking at next is will
the pathogen be able to overcome host
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when anyone asks this, a plant
pathologist is always going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course the pathogen will be able to
overcome host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: History, 165 years of history,
tells us that certainly the pathogen will
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we get some data to back that up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the areas of plant pathology
that I have been watching from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sideline is a really fascinating area of
studies on effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has its own little term called
effectoromex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effectors are proteins that are secreted
by plant pathogens to help them infect the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting things about
effectors is that our proteins from plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will recognize the effector and that's how
the our protein works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can get a better idea of what
effectors are present in a pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: population and you guys have enough
diversity in our genes, then we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to say, hey, this field has this set
of effectors, mesuric, what plant do we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like precision agriculture at the
pathology breeding level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absolutely believe that this will be
possible within the next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I believe that is because of my
friends Paul Burch and Ingo Hein at the
[SPEAKER_00]: James Hutton Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up with this technology that
they called effector enrichment and
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally did not come up with
their name, but it's called Effenseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paul said, you always know if the
audience is listening when you say
[SPEAKER_00]: Effenseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Effenseq, what they have done is they
have made biotinylated RNA baits for a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge number of effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: From both phytophthora infestans and
phytophthora capsicii.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have from phytophthora capsicii,
all myseids, the most famous type of
[SPEAKER_00]: effector is an effector that has a protein
motif, an amino acid motif called RXLR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have 509 RXLR effectors in
capsicii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in capsicii, there's also an
interesting group of effectors called
[SPEAKER_00]: crinklers because when they infiltrated
them into the co-chanam and thamiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: it crinkled the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so they have 65 crinkler
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in infestans, you can see they
have a lot of effector baits for infestans
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have these RNA baits that are
ready to go that have been biotinylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it works is you take your
genomic DNA from each of the isolates of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, you cut it at an adapter so that
you'd be able to amplify it in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: take your RNA bait, hybridize them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the RNA bait is coated in
biotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take your streptavidin,
coated magnetic beads, put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The streptavidin binds to the biotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add a magnet because the magnetic
beads will then come to the magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your little pool of effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then degrade the RNA away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have, after amplified,
the entire effector set of every isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can then sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've done this on a small number of
isolates, and it's been effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it on isolates that have
genome sequences so they know the effector
[SPEAKER_00]: complement that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these guys don't have is a huge
collection of isolates that you could then
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the effectors and go back and
test them on host plants to see if that
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen was then susceptible or resistant
on that host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: For both the phytophthora capsicii and the
phytophthora infestans, we plan to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: FNSeq with the folks at James Hutton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I said, this will give us some
functional testing of the alleles and
[SPEAKER_00]: allelic variants that they have identified
to see if an allelic variant will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: enable the pathogen to get around the
resistance of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal would then have this lead to a
diagnostic where, in fact, you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a field fairly rapidly, get 50
isolates, determine what effectors they
[SPEAKER_00]: have, and then figure out what would be
the best plant to put in that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: For capsicii, that would work because you
have relatively few new individuals coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: For infestans, what would be really
interesting is to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability of effectors within those
asexual clonal lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill Fry's lab has some evidence that
there is some variability, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the older lineages, but it would be really
fascinating to know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability there is that would help us
manage the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it would be interesting to see
if the effector variability corresponded
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way to the variability within
lineages that we saw with the GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though, I hope you agree,
that even though two phytophthora species
[SPEAKER_00]: are very different, my lab has been able
to use similar strategies to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by understanding these populations,
we firmly believe that we will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve disease management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acknowledgements, this is my lab here on
the right, the phytophthora capsicii work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by a previous student,
Amara Dunn, along with Maren Carlson,
[SPEAKER_00]: the infestans work, done by Zach Hanson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maren did a lot of the bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole list of collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been funded for the capsicii through
the state of New York, Department of Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: and Markets, along with several different
grant panels from NIFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long list of collaborators that are also
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is, is there a
possibility of hybridization between
[SPEAKER_00]: capsicii and infestans?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some phytophthora species,
you can hybridize, but not these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do we know which R
genes match with which effectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the defeated R genes, we tend to know
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, for the R gene that's most
common in pepper, we do not know the
[SPEAKER_00]: effector yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of folks working on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like by the time we were to a
point where we could actually do some
[SPEAKER_00]: field-based diagnostic, that information
would be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should ask for questions from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Larry's question is, what's driving
that change in population structure in
[SPEAKER_00]: infestans?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really one dominant clonal
lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is that no one knows for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my hypothesis is that that particular
clonal lineage is being dispersed widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was widely found in several regions
that are both tomato transplant production
[SPEAKER_00]: and potato seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's just at the moment the
lineage that's being most widely
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen, history would tell us
that in the next two or three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have a new clonal lineage that
arrives probably from Mexico that is
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and beefier and has less genetic
bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will start to take over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be fantastic if that one same
clonal lineage stayed around a bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we actually know how to control
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you say you think it would come up
from Mexico?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would it come up from Mexico?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mexico is the center of origin of
phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a sexually reproducing
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a fairly significant trade
with the country of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most likely source of entry would
be Mexico, just because that's where the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest amount of diversity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other parts of the world, the pathogen
is predominantly clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get a new lineage from somewhere
else in the world, we would immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: know that, because those lineages are
already known.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matthew's question is, the founding
oospores last about three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the data that we've seen,
that inbred oospores last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't actually know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know right now is that there
there, because what I've seen in growers'
[SPEAKER_00]: fields, the pathogen remains for a fairly
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably why I said,
chances are they last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, you'll get new inbreds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my thinking would be that any
oospore will live for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after you lose the founders,
like in Marin's little diagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys over here are always going to be
inbreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we don't know is if we're going to
see a reduction in pathogenicity due to
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to tell that in a grower
field, because you never know if new
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum has come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should be able to see that in our
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much genetic variation is there
within a clonal lineage or between the
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal lineages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within lineage variation is more rare
than between lineage variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the numbers for between lineage
variation with our GBS data are known,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have them off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's much more variation between
the lineages than within the lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is true that this is the first time
that we've really been able to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: variation within a clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: With microsatellites, a lineage,
you know, all of the 166 isolates were not
[SPEAKER_00]: identical, but about 150 of them had the
exact same SSR genotype with 12
[SPEAKER_00]: microsatellite loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a variant individual, I think there
were maybe 10 to 15 variants, would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: new allele at one of the 12 loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, when we looked at those
variants in the location in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood joining tree, the GBS data
was unrelated to whether or not there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a SSR variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
