[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: To start, we'll just sort of walk through
some of the basics behind Vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety Trial Garden Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of the background and where
you can find more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the page for the Vegetable Variety
Trial Garden Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll go to Citizen Science and scroll
down a little bit and then here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click here, this will bring you to
the page that have all of the information
[SPEAKER_01]: for VVTG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this project is sort of a demonstration
garden and we've done it in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for maybe four years, I think 2011
to 2014 or so, but it's sort of been on
[SPEAKER_01]: hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really happy to relaunch the
project for 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year has a different theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the past there's been some
companion garden theme or ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: garden themes or pollinator friendly
themes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year's theme we're just doing big
yields in small places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can find the design draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year there are several plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a spring planting that will go in
March to April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are the nine beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each bed is three feet by three feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have a summer planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes in and around May.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the beds stay the same throughout
the season and some of them change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll also have a fall planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not all of the beds will be planted in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you'd like to plant all of them,
that is totally cool and you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here are just some suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some garlic and some cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also on the website you'll find a
timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will sort of guide you through
month by month everything that should be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is opening day for registration and
registration closes on February 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: In March we'll be mailing out seeds for
that spring planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will receive the seeds by mail and
then you can directly sow them early in
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have another webinar in
mid-March to sort of get everyone on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same page, touch base, answer any
questions, and go forward to the planting
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then May.
[SPEAKER_01]: May's a big month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have a plant pickup day at
Cornell on May 4th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the transplants that will be
started by an organic gardening class here
[SPEAKER_01]: on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can pick up the transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be the tomatoes, you know,
more of the tender crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 4th and we'll also have some
educational opportunities on campus as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to connect with the Cornell
Botanical Gardens and tour one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable gardens there and also tour the
Dillman Hill Student Farm here on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be a day to pick up your plants
but also to connect with other educators
[SPEAKER_01]: and tour some relevant gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in July we'll have another webinar,
just another opportunity to touch base.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you are planting and maintaining and
also harvesting, part of this project
[SPEAKER_01]: really focuses on the vegetable varieties
for gardeners database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will be, the webinar in July will
be a time to sort of go over the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions will be answered at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'll just use that as a
springboard to show you the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the vegetable variety for
gardeners database and it's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's used nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it used internationally at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you are in Ithaca, New York where
we are today and you're really curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about what tomatoes do well in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can go onto this database and
see what varieties have done well for
[SPEAKER_01]: others in a similar climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just create an account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get any spam emails or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be able to read a little bit
about the variety, about the plant type
[SPEAKER_01]: and how fruitful it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can maybe discover if it would be
a good fit for what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this gives you an idea of what this
database is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see, I mean, people are coming
from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'd like to talk a little bit about
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do want to participate in this
project, I'll tell you first everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that we do on our end and then tell you
everything that you would do on your end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we provide seeds and plants for the
spring and summer plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide you the design plan,
which is right up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide you with signage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of these beds would get their own
sign for visitors to read and learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about what's growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide you that timeline and
checklist, which I showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also provide you a template
for your local plan of work, including
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation templates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Laurie's going to talk a little bit
about that towards the end of the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we provide support and guidance
throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions or concerns,
we're happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have two other webinars scheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will be great times to touch base
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sort of your end of the
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you plant, maintain, and harvest the
vegetable variety trial gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll enter data into that database that
I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will share progress and feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photos throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to see how things are doing and
just hear about the different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some are doing better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some counties are having different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd just love to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll also complete an
evaluation at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this helps us know maybe what went well
and what we could do differently for next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you'll see there's the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the timeline and the registration
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of data do you need to
collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Fiona said it would be great for us
to get just general updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be just anecdotal data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what data we really want?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's one of the varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: That we have planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black seeded Simpson lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so put in the finder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson, I think that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is black seeded Simpson
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choose to grow black seeded
Simpson lettuce, what we want or encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: you to do is to register your garden on
this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might choose a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not registered as an individual,
I would register you as a county
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would go under log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I should have done log in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not be registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might go under log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, not registered with our site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would add a garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some name that recognizes your Cornell
Cooperative Extension site as the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: An individual might do it differently if
they're doing it at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you fill this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do need to register if you're not
registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're registered,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can add a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm logged in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you're registered,
get this log in successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're expecting you each demo
site to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a general review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just be verbally what you
thought of what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you provide overall rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you can run the mouse over that
dropdown menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically give it 1 to 5 stars on
overall rating, taste, yield, ease,
[SPEAKER_00]: reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just how easy was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yield and taste is obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have to take a consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to upload a picture,
you can upload a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like an interface that we
developed a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it functions usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think upload picture still works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let us know if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will save mine because I didn't
write anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're expecting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, can you participate only part of
the programming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you feel that the spring planting is
something that you're super interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe you don't have the capacity or
the volunteers to do it throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and the fall, that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also substitute plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, oh, man, I really don't like
microgreens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our volunteers don't like microgreens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how we would use these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could do a different planting in
that bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to just adjust the signage
template.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do the partial season planting,
you would have to provide your own seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do the full one, you get the
seeds and the transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just do partial planting,
you have to provide them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is incentivizing
people who do the whole thing get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have extras, we will share those
with people who are doing partials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're doing partials,
please register because we might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to accommodate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're giving priority to people who
are doing the full thing with our budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't have the budget all spent,
on those people who are doing the full
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, we might be able to accommodate
partial beds in place, but they're not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just give this design based on this
three by three bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have bigger beds, you would have to
think through your own adjustment of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can still do it, but you'll have to
think through those adjustments or consult
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can certainly help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, can I interject just really quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are starting from scratch and
you don't already have the garden beds
[SPEAKER_01]: established, we have a document that will
help you sort of walk through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is on the website, recommended
site prep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it walks you through the soil,
the layout, building the beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: what materials are best, fencing,
signage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even a video on our website
that you can watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just three minutes, and it shows how
one of these gardens and sites was
[SPEAKER_01]: established before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another question was,
will this only be for 2017?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been trying to do this,
I think, since 20, what was that year,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to do this vegetable
varieties trial project for the last five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very thankful that Fiona is
taking the lead and has developed all this
[SPEAKER_00]: support network for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're launching it full on
this year, and our plan is to do it every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come up with a different design in
future years, or maybe because they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals, we can modify the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on how it goes for you and the
feedback you provide, maybe you would even
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out suggestions on what you'd like
to see as part of the planting in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hope is that this is ongoing into
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just show you one more thing,
because now I'm asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under garden guidance, we do have that
pollinator friendly thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under garden guidance, we have food
gardening and growing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this selected list of vegetable
varieties for gardeners in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is for 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create this every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiona got some of those varieties off this
list, but some of them aren't on this
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that you'll be helping
us do is, if you put the data into the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable varieties for gardeners website,
that helps inform this document,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the stuff's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only put the recommended stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see one of, sorry,
this is, I've got a mouse out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the varieties on this list that
have this asterisk on them, they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations from New Yorkers from the
vegetable variety list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's ultimately where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to repeat this many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want New York State gardeners and
our associations who are doing vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: trial gardens to be informing this
document.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the overarching long-term goal is
that gardeners are the ones who help us
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question comes in, do you have suggestions
on how to break up the maintenance work
[SPEAKER_00]: among volunteers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, I got an answer from Laurie in
Wayne County.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Wayne County, we assigned each
interested volunteer a bed and added
[SPEAKER_00]: signage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bed is maintained by Mars Master
Gardener Volunteer and their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's a couple names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bed is only three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this beautiful bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody else have any suggestions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every county is so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their volunteer force and the time
that their educators have to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be a little bit different for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have done this project in the
past and you've found that your way of
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance worked really well,
please share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strategy that I've heard is,
so there's always a time in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: each week when there's an educational
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while you're doing the education,
you might do a little maintenance at that
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other resources on this page?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't dive into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we also wanted to share with you is
some tools to help you report your annual
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting, as we always do, and to also
measure your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an evaluation, some sample
evaluation forms, and they open up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to download if I
click on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so these are just some sample
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will open up in Word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I have to scoot over to Word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sharing the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Desktop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you all can start to see the
Word document opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see she has a simple evaluation
form that you might have whenever you have
[SPEAKER_00]: an event or some other, that maintenance
learning time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also, we have another form,
the other evaluation form is more
[SPEAKER_00]: open-ended questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to share is some
about your plan of, your local plan of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of you educators might think that
this looks familiar because you've had to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill out a local plan of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might choose your food gardening
and the Special Friday Trial Garden to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet one of these outcomes, which is part
of our whole plan of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she really just put this document
here with the thought that you would pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you would delete the things that
weren't relevant to what your focus was,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you would keep the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a little background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's kind of filled this in for
you so it would be easy for you to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: program planning paperwork that we all
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sort of choose, she made them
different colors so you can sort of choose
[SPEAKER_00]: your theme and then work through the whole
thing that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the hope that this really leads into
writing a very easy success story once
[SPEAKER_00]: you've collected some information too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she added that tool right to that
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to the staff webpage under
units, organizational development,
[SPEAKER_00]: program planning and development,
I just want to point out some changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the statewide plan of work that impacts
our Master Gardener volunteer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that local plan of work template,
here it is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one she filled in, but you can
get it on that staff website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the statewide plan of work from
which Fiona drew those outcomes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to point out how it has
changed in the realm of the Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardener volunteer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are six parts to the plan of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, I'm going to scroll rather fast
all the way to the last number six one,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is community economic
vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of statewide regional initiatives
that fall within this plan of work include
[SPEAKER_00]: the Master Gardener volunteer program,
land use and public spaces, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be doing some work related to
land use and public spaces with our Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardener volunteer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a brand new point in the plan
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worded differently previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not called land use and residential
spaces before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here the number of
residents practicing management tactics
[SPEAKER_00]: and homes, lawns and gardens and
landscapes that support environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stewardship and a sustainable community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the bulk of our support of our
community falls in this area for Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardener volunteer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some footnotes here because
you might be doing something a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific and that you might want to
affiliate with a different outcome in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plan of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wrote those out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing something focused on
climate change, adaption and mitigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: water resources, biodiversity,
natural resource protection, you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: up this whole document, scroll back up to
the second portion of the plan of work
[SPEAKER_00]: under climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out 2.1, 2.4 and 2.7 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one includes biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 3.7 in the natural resource,
the environment and natural resource one
[SPEAKER_00]: also covers those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's a thrust of your program in the
year ahead or in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If by chance you're focusing on compost
waste management, if you look at the third
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the plan, environment and natural
resource and sustainable energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.6 and 3.7 deal with composting and waste
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're focusing on school,
community, home and food gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would refer to the plan of work on
nutrition, food safety and security and
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity and prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.4 talks about food security one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some background and Fiona pulled
some of that background into that plan of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already spelled it out for you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really, it also includes
activities, include the Master Gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer program, seed supper program,
youth grow is also affiliated with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be one of the things that
the thrust of your program is to see
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in the number of people growing
their own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feel free to reach out with questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to continue this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
