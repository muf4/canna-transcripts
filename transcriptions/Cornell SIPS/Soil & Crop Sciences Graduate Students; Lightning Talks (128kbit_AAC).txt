[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Philip Lanza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a PhD candidate with Louie in the
Farmers Data Lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with farmers to kind of help them
experiment a little better, get more value
[SPEAKER_03]: from their experiments, more or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk about, first,
some of the projects I'm working on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and at the end, go over some more of the
stuff our lab does.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm working on is applying
observational research techniques to
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomic systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work well in medical trials where
things are complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data is kind of messy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are data-driven approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the big thing that we need to do this
is context.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in medical, it would be like,
does this person smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's their age range?
[SPEAKER_03]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In farming, we use relevant biophysical
and environmental data that let us kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: objectively say, OK, well, this happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: What context did it happen in?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the challenge to that in the project is
one is a way to help get this data to
[SPEAKER_03]: where we can use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next is showing something we can do
with these data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last is doing some analysis to
show that it can kind of help,
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully, improve experimental
interpretation and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I did was design a
system to help us get all these contextual
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any kind of agronomically relevant
environmental data, like weather,
[SPEAKER_03]: terrain data, soil data, all these things,
this lets you do it in an easy-to-use
[SPEAKER_03]: interface.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's web-based.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pull it down, and it generates
everything in a consistent format.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing, building an in-season anomaly
detection system to identify areas at
[SPEAKER_03]: subfield scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, 3-meter resolution of anomalous
crop response.
[SPEAKER_03]: So given all these covariates,
it should be responding this way based
[SPEAKER_03]: upon NDVI.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then identify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then one, we can identify these areas
and send scouts out there to find them or
[SPEAKER_03]: find out this experiment had a bunch of
bad areas, so maybe it may not be the
[SPEAKER_03]: best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last thing, I'm doing a comparison using
the anomaly data on a commonly accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: correlation of the great soil health
versus yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using production environment soil
health data from Joseph and Harold's
[SPEAKER_03]: group, which thanks for letting me use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to analyze it where
areas have no anomalies versus varying
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees in C.
[SPEAKER_03]: My assumption is that no anomalous areas
will be stronger correlation than that can
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we account for these things,
we can get better experimental design and
[SPEAKER_03]: plan things better and just account for
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lastly, we're a farmers data lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like QR codes, here's the QR code.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're transdisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We co-create solutions with farmers using
agronomy, data science, GIS, social
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some cool lab numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new postdoc, Abdel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting some new members in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any questions about what
I'm doing or what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take them now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philip, how many farmers are you working
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say like 12 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 24 sites for farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any farmers who might want to
work with us, let us know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you anticipate increasing that in the
future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that's expanding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is 12 a good number?
[SPEAKER_03]: From my point of view, the more,
the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the techniques I use are data
driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more, the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, our forums cover a lot of the
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the more representation you have,
the better data you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the more people we work with,
the more people we can help, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of cropping systems are you
working with?
[SPEAKER_10]: What farm is growing?
[SPEAKER_10]: And roughly, how large are the farms that
you're working?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of dairy farms are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grain corn, stover corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anomaly detection stuff, I'm going to
be working with soybeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: But pretty much any grain crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to work with until
we can work with other higher value crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe in a couple years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, field crops, agronomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you're using this
information so you can design better
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, to me, doesn't seem like the kicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of want to get that out to the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are you actually making that
linkage and taking this information to
[SPEAKER_02]: inform the farming community itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one example, what we work with is a
little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't impose experimental design.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with endogenous experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the farmer, some do side by side
strips, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other ones we've worked with in the past
have designed their, say, control around
[SPEAKER_03]: the border of a field, which, as we know,
isn't like standard growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm saying with the context,
we can pull down this to give us objective
[SPEAKER_03]: data that we can then use to kind of
explain a little more about what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the anomaly, we can go in the
past, and say, OK, well, this experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't turn out exactly how we thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at these anomalous areas,
maybe their treatment area had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: them within it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't be kind of standard crop
response, which we can use to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, we'd better interpret this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, if we consistently identify
anomalous areas, and maybe it's probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: biophysical cause, if we do help them
design their experiments, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, don't put your thing here,
put it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did that kind of answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're working right with them in the
first instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Becky Stupp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a first year master's student
studying in Tony DiTomasso's lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm here to talk about my thesis
project, which is optimizing field margin
[SPEAKER_06]: management for weed control and ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why would a farmer want to plant
something in the margin of their field?
[SPEAKER_06]: So biodiversity plantings are very well
studied at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: They improve biodiversity across multiple
trophic levels, as well as provide various
[SPEAKER_06]: ecosystem services, such as nutrient
cycling, water filtration, and more
[SPEAKER_06]: famously, pollination and biocontrol of
crop pests by providing habitat for
[SPEAKER_06]: beneficial arthropods.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while the seeds can be prohibitively
expensive at times, historically,
[SPEAKER_06]: funding for these plantings has been
available to growers through programs like
[SPEAKER_06]: the NRCS Conservation Stewardship Program.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sure about the current status of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we know from talking to the NRCS that
New York farmers tend to put these
[SPEAKER_06]: plantings way out in a corner of their
field rather than close to their crop
[SPEAKER_06]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are some barriers to farmer
adoption that we're facing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right off the bat, there's a lack of
research about how field margin plantings
[SPEAKER_06]: affect weed communities within the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in New York state, a lot of
this research happens over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not really sure what might happen
with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And additionally, farmers have raised
concerns to members of our research group,
[SPEAKER_06]: such as, are these plantings going to act
as reservoirs for weeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: And is there a chance that these
beneficial plants might move into the crop
[SPEAKER_06]: and then act as weeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: So in order to address these concerns,
I am comparing weed and arthropod
[SPEAKER_06]: communities in both planted and
conventional margins.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have two corn fields, one up in
Musgrave, one down the road in Varna.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've established wildflower plantings
and grass plantings, which are either
[SPEAKER_06]: mowed according to NRCS guidelines for
weed suppression when they reach a certain
[SPEAKER_06]: height, or they're left unmanaged for the
rest of the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have unplanted conventional
margins, which are mowed when they reach a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain height.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are mowed every three weeks,
regardless of height.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some are sprayed at the same time as
the corn, so at about V3.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is done to just mimic what
farmers are actually doing at this point
[SPEAKER_06]: in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that I want to get into
before I start talking about my actual
[SPEAKER_06]: results from the first year is that these
are often perennial plantings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't do much during the first
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So over here on the left, we have an
example of great establishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of those plants are wildflowers,
but you'll notice a lack of actual
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know from previous research in this
lab that arthropods tend to show up more
[SPEAKER_06]: when there are actual flowers rather than
the species itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that to say, arthropod minors did not
differ across treatments in this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you're going to have a weed
eaters problem, it's typically going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: in the first year because the native
perennials do tend to be all competed by
[SPEAKER_06]: aggressive annual weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the density during the first
year of establishment, so the number of
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds in half meter squared quadrats.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see in July, the main
difference that we're seeing is that the
[SPEAKER_06]: glyphosate has significantly less weeds
than any of these planted treatments on
[SPEAKER_06]: the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But by the time you get to September,
there's basically no difference across
[SPEAKER_06]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from an agronomic perspective,
I would argue that September is the more
[SPEAKER_06]: important month to be looking at because
that's when a lot of our problematic weeds
[SPEAKER_06]: will be going to seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also collected biomass data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the red is the broadleaf weeds,
green is grass weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: On this side are the conventional
unplanted margins, and this side is the
[SPEAKER_06]: planted margins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll notice that each half has two
tall bars and two short bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is a complicated graph for
this presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main difference here is the
mowing, which is pretty intuitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's less biomass when you mow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also not really seeing a
difference in the unplanted versus planted
[SPEAKER_06]: strips.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a farmer and you're concerned
about weeds in your margin plantings,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least in the first year, it's looking
like those fears are thankfully fairly
[SPEAKER_06]: unfounded, as long as you're following
NRCS mowing guidelines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also continuing a project from a
previous graduate student in our lab,
[SPEAKER_06]: Sophie Westbrook.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was looking at how the seeding rates
impact establishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to show you what these
plantings look like about three years in
[SPEAKER_06]: once they're actually established.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also starting to see very
ecologically important species,
[SPEAKER_06]: like butterfly milkweed, start to show up,
which we haven't seen in previous years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're supporting fairly healthy
arthropod communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_09]: How does the implantation work?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it broadcasted?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you definition you there?
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we have been broadcast seeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some companies do drill seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But especially with the grass seeds,
there tends to be issues with them going
[SPEAKER_06]: through the hopper because they're kind of
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really great talk, Becky.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering, has there been any work
mixing annual and perennial wildflowers
[SPEAKER_11]: within a mixture so that you can see the
benefits of the first year?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in our region that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, like, not a lot of benefits from
the first year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking, like, that's covering the
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like land cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like we talk about, like,
protecting our soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really nice benefit to have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not doing what the NRCS is maybe the
main purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Pritaman Bajwa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a first year PhD student with Dr.
Vipin Kumar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'll be presenting you some of
the studies that we conducted last year as
[SPEAKER_00]: the integrated weed management approach in
corn and soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corn and soybean are one of the major
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weeds are one of the most significant
pests causing the yield reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what farmers are doing these days,
they are heavily reliant on the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, 96% of the corn fields and
98% of the soybean fields received the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide applications, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this amount of overreliance,
there is a problem of herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are currently 533 unique cases of
herbicide resistant weeds globally to 168
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, since last three decades,
we have no new mode of action for the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the top, we have new problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The palmarum wrenth and waterhemp,
which are the most problematic weeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Midwest, they have been recently
identified in the Northeastern states,
[SPEAKER_00]: including New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York populations have reported the
glyphosate resistance and also potential
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple resistance to HPPD and
photosystem II inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are heavily reliant on chemical
weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a time that we switch to a more
balanced approach for the long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental and economical
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that in mind, we designed some
of the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first study, we are looking at the
cover crop termination timings,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the herbicide strategies for
the wheat suppression in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had two termination timings,
early termination and planting queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early termination, we terminated the cover
crop two weeks prior to the corn
[SPEAKER_00]: plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the planting green, we planted corn
in the standing cover crop, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: terminated three days after the corn
plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is said that more the amount of
biomass is related to more wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time of termination,
we have approximately two and a half times
[SPEAKER_00]: higher cover crop biomass in the planting
green, which we also observed in the wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first is the early
termination with Roundup, no pre or post
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the planting green with the
effective pre and post herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in another objective, we are looking
at the three-way approach with the culture
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, with the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in-season targeting the weeds with
the pre and post herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in later season, we are targeting
weeds with the seed impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the cover crops and herbicides
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about the seed impact mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed impact mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed impact mill, it is the attachment
behind the combine that it has these
[SPEAKER_00]: mills, which rotate at a very high speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pulverize the wheat seeds coming
along with the chaff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So main objective is the wheat seed bank
management so that the weeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested, they don't go to the wheat seed
bank and become problematic for the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the third objective, we are
comparing different non-chemical and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical treatments for the wheat seed
bank management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using the interomore and electric
weeder with the mat and seed impact mill
[SPEAKER_00]: and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed impact mill, I have already
discussed a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: interomore.
[SPEAKER_00]: My videos are not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interomore, it has the blades here,
rotating blades, which rotate at
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 1,800 RPM, targeting the
weeds in between the crop rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the treatments look like
after the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this needs the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the electric weeder,
the weed zapper that we are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the generator behind the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets the energy from the PTO shaft
of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the copper rod in front of a tractor,
it gets electrified, which targets the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are above the soybean canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the damage done to the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the velvet leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the stem of the lamb squatter,
completely smoked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch of herbicide studies also we
are conducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are evaluating the crop safety
and the weed control with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: doses of the metribuzin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metribuzin is a pre-emergent herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plant the soybean, we spray the
herbicide before the crop emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 280 grams per hectare and 420 grams,
this is the normal field rate the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they complain that there are some weed
escapes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are evaluating the different doses,
where we can optimize the metribuzin rates
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also not harm the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we observe that when we go higher,
we have a good weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we go much higher than the label
rate, we have the lower stand count and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the pictures five weeks after
the spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the same treatments eight
weeks after the spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we have a good control here
as compared to the non-treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are also conducting some of the
herbicide studies with the different pre-
[SPEAKER_00]: and post-herbicides in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So waterhemp as I already discussed,
this is the picture near the Rochester.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the farmer field, this is the amount of
infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are conducting a bunch of pre- and
post-herbicide studies in the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly at the higher rates in the last
pictures that you showed us, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting good control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you discuss what that means both
economically and environmentally to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: those higher rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Economically, it will increase the cost,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this particular chemical?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because metribuzin is a very common
herbicide and it's not very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmentally, there are many studies
that people are conducting with different
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides that how the soil microbiota is
affecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are not conducting this soil
microbiota studies with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you mentioned at the beginning of your
presentation that there hasn't been much
[SPEAKER_07]: improvement on weed management for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the big picture reasons for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that there is no new model fraction
like herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is because it is very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to spend millions of millions of
dollars for the new mode of actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why the companies like Bayer
and Corteva, they are not releasing new
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just mixing different mode of
actions, like HPPD with the atrazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are releasing the new formulations
instead of new chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very costly and it's very
time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It take like seven, eight years to
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Chen Xifeng, and I'm currently
a first year PhD student in Dr. Ichiro's
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm going to talk about my research
project, which is about the apparent
[SPEAKER_01]: versus intrinsic temperature sensitivity
of soil respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why soil respiration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's almost the largest
terrestrial carbon emission, which emits
[SPEAKER_01]: about 60 to 80 pedigrees of carbon per
year from the landing to the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes up almost half of the total
terrestrial carbon efflux.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meanwhile, it also affects the
soil organic carbon storage capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, the carbon emitted
from soil respiration is growing rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: through year, which indicates its higher
and higher importance in global carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how soil respiration will respond to
changing climates?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the changing temperatures or
precipitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So intrinsically, if we consider the
chemical essence of soil respiration,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's basically a bunch of different
organic compounds are oxidized to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon dioxide and other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this process is highly influenced by
the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one explanation is the Arrhenius
theory, which is shown in the left figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this theory, the temperature will
not only influence the molecular energy
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution, but also it will influence
the activation energy, which is the Ea in
[SPEAKER_01]: the figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hence, it will influence the chemical
reaction rate and makes the reaction rate
[SPEAKER_01]: increase exponentially with temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we consider the enzyme catalysis in
these reactions, the processes may be more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated as shown in the upper right
figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, there may be optimal
temperatures for the reaction rate to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach the maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than these various intrinsic
temperature sensitivities of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration, there are also multiple
environmental constraints, such as the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil moisture and soil aggregation,
which can modify the intrinsic temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity of soil respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moreover, if we consider the
collective response from multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: processes in soil respiration,
the observed temperature response,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the apparent temperature
response, may be much different from the
[SPEAKER_01]: intrinsic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question here is, should there be
one or multiple functions for the
[SPEAKER_01]: intrinsic temperature sensitivity in
different ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_01]: So several arguments for this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the biochemical pathways governing the
soil respiration and soil organic carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: compositions are all the similar in
different ecosystems, then there should be
[SPEAKER_01]: similar intrinsic temperature function,
which is also assumed in most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biogeochemical models.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the real world, the case may be
different, because they may have different
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical pathways and organic carbon
compositions, which can lead to quite
[SPEAKER_01]: different intrinsic temperature functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to solve these questions, we've
collected the soil respiration
[SPEAKER_01]: observations from several incubation
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results do show a different
temperature response for the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases, the soil respiration
increases exponentially, as shown in the
[SPEAKER_01]: red figure, with temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other cases, the soil respiration
may respond sigmoidly or in the model to
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on these results, we would like
to calculate the intrinsic temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: response from the incubation data to see
if there's universal function type or
[SPEAKER_01]: there are different kinds of intrinsic
function types for different ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the follow-up question is that if
there's different intrinsic temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: functions, what's the reason cause this
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we get this information from the
incubation data sets, we can furthermore
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate this temperature function into
the biogeochemical models to further
[SPEAKER_01]: simulate the field measurements of soil
respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to do in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any suggestions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering what you're thinking about
the time scales at which the incubation
[SPEAKER_08]: occurs versus some of the time scales that
you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, is short-term warming over
the course of, say, hours or days,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that going to have different processes
than, say, responses to longer-term
[SPEAKER_08]: warming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think time scale is quite an
important factor to influence the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature sensitivity because they will
sometimes influence the substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: availability, the carbon quality,
such kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the incubation data set we have right
now, our cooperators collected right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing mainly on short-term incubation,
not like for incubation for several years
[SPEAKER_01]: or decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the incubation time scale is
from several months to the longest and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe one year or two years, and not so
long-term response, not so long-term time
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe there may be different
temperature sensitivities in a longer time
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the nature of carbon between
the different experimental units,
[SPEAKER_02]: or were they all similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, could you please?
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 evolution from your soil incubation
that's going to be based on the carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that you have in the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So were they equivalent across your
different treatments, or are you looking
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically at the behavior of different
complexities of carbon within your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, I'm working on the mixture
of all kinds of different carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, we cannot separate different
carbon substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see if they have different
temperature functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, in the incubation data set,
they have a soil sample, which is sampled
[SPEAKER_01]: from a particular set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of hard to separate
different kinds of carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the near future, we can work on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I start, on behalf of my peers,
I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an awesome turnout.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it really means a lot for everyone
showing up supporting the first-year
[SPEAKER_05]: cohort.
[SPEAKER_05]: Community is so important right now,
as Dr. Buckley alluded to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is awesome to see everyone showing
support.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my name is Nazir Adam Sharifi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to call me Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a first-year MS PhD student in the
Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab under Dr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew Ryan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to follow Chenxi's
presentation and give an introduction to
[SPEAKER_05]: my own research on no-till corn
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the Sustainable Cropping Systems
Lab, we do a lot of work in organic
[SPEAKER_05]: no-till rolled crimp systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, what that means is we plant a
cover crop in the fall, allowing it to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow in overwinter until it reaches a
suitable growth stage for termination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we go in with a roller crimper,
which is a steel drum with blunt blades
[SPEAKER_05]: mounted on front of a tractor to terminate
that cover crop while simultaneously
[SPEAKER_05]: planting our cash crop with a no-till
planter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after a few months, if all goes
well, the goal is to have a healthy cash
[SPEAKER_05]: crop with the mulch serving as a
protective layer to increase water
[SPEAKER_05]: infiltration and reduce runoff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mulch also acts as a physical barrier
to suppress weed growth without the use of
[SPEAKER_05]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on our research, we truly believe
that no-till farming through the
[SPEAKER_05]: integration of rolled crimp cover crops
has great potential to enhance field crop
[SPEAKER_05]: production, not only for organic farmers,
but for the broader agricultural
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, there's a wealth of studies
that exist on no-till soybean planted into
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crops, with our lab contributing
heavily to that literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, research on no-till corn planted
into cover crops remains limited with
[SPEAKER_05]: previous work-facing systems and meeting
the cropping system's demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the Sustainable Cropping Systems
Lab, we developed a 256-plot surface
[SPEAKER_05]: response experiment to explore organic
no-till performance under different
[SPEAKER_05]: cropping system designs.
[SPEAKER_05]: This approach is valuable for
understanding how multiple variables,
[SPEAKER_05]: such as nitrogen rates and seeding rates,
interact and influence response variables
[SPEAKER_05]: like weed biomass or corn yield under
different rolled crimp cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in our study, we examined field corn
planted into two rolled crimp cover crop
[SPEAKER_05]: mixtures, a hairy vetch oat and a hairy
vetch cereal rye mixture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also tested the impact of supplemental
weed management through the presence and
[SPEAKER_05]: absence of inner-row mowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the inner-row mower features five
individual mowing units that's designed to
[SPEAKER_05]: cut between the crop row and operating
above the mulch surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: And additionally, we evaluated a range of
corn seeding rates and side-dress nitrogen
[SPEAKER_05]: rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of things that one can do
with such an awesome data set.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one avenue I'm exploring is a
relatively new approach to analyze surface
[SPEAKER_05]: response experiments, and that's piecewise
structural equation modeling, or PSEM.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm particularly excited about PSEM
because it provides a holistic view of the
[SPEAKER_05]: agro-ecosystem, making it ideal to
understand ecosystem interactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tool widely used by pure
ecologists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you see here is a simplified model
of the interactions that we expect to
[SPEAKER_05]: occur in our organic no-till corn system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a quick look at how these
factors are connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: So increasing corn density boosts yield,
as does increasing side-dress nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, side-dress nitrogen can also
benefit weeds, which increases weed
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then more weeds negatively impacts
yields, while higher corn density
[SPEAKER_05]: suppresses those weeds through
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the general framework,
but what happens when we apply this to a
[SPEAKER_05]: hairy vetch oat system with in-row mowing?
[SPEAKER_05]: What about without in-row mowing?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do these interactions begin to shift?
[SPEAKER_05]: And take a quick look at some preliminary
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start by looking at the hairy
vetch oat system without in-row mowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this model, a solid line indicates a
significant effect, while a dotted line
[SPEAKER_05]: represents a non-significant effect based
on p-values.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the hairy vetch oat system without
in-row mowing, side-dress nitrogen doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: significantly affect weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I want to focus on more here is
this finding, the significant negative
[SPEAKER_05]: impact of weed biomass on corn yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: This reveals a key system constraint,
while hairy vetch, a legume cover crop
[SPEAKER_05]: providing high nitrogen to that corn,
it lacks sufficient above-ground biomass
[SPEAKER_05]: during the field season to effectively
suppress weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by adding the in-row mower for
supplemental weed management, we achieve
[SPEAKER_05]: an exciting outcome where weed biomass no
longer significantly affects yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: These preliminary findings validate the
in-row mower as an effective tillage-free
[SPEAKER_05]: weed control tactic for field corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for simplicity, I previously omitted
p-values and standardized coefficients,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they offer very valuable insights.
[SPEAKER_05]: These coefficients quantify the influence
between system components.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we can see that corn density and
side-dress nitrogen have relatively
[SPEAKER_05]: similar impact on yield, as shown by their
comparable values.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how, again, might this change in a
nitrogen-starved system where maybe hairy
[SPEAKER_05]: cereal rye is integrated into that cover
crop mix?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will yield become a more strong driver of
yield in this system?
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the questions that we can begin
to answer with PSEM.
[SPEAKER_05]: So moving forward, I'm excited to dive
deeper into this data and carry out a
[SPEAKER_05]: streamlined version of the study to
examine these interactions across
[SPEAKER_05]: different site locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are my acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than happy to take any questions if
we have time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're hitting me on all the spots that
hurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, timing is critical, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have a mixture, you're trying
to aim for critical timing of termination.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't terminate it at the right
time, it can come back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you terminate it too late,
it can reproduce seeds and infest your
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So timing is critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's kind of like in hairy bech
oat and a cereal rye mixture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to aim between 50% to 100% anthesis
of that cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then mid to late that flowering stage
of that hairy bech.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of finding the nice
in-between of where can we get the best
[SPEAKER_05]: kill of both of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But excellent question, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enrique?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are good questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Emergence is something that I'm actually
really interested in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was an undergrad actually at Cornell
University and research assistant in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan Lab freshman year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see a lot around our experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Emergence is always an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am really maybe technologically
optimist here, but hoping that some good
[SPEAKER_05]: planting technology can cut through these
thick cover crop mulches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they provide so much, as I said,
weed suppression and water infiltration
[SPEAKER_05]: and soil erosion, which is a huge,
huge problem, especially in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So technological optimist maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, emergence is something to
consider.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: In one of your figures, I was just
thinking where you see an improvement in
[SPEAKER_10]: corn yield or whatever crop yield at the
end and potential decrease in weed
[SPEAKER_10]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_10]: You include the interim mower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do those benefits outweigh what would be
the additional cost?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of actually renting or owning an interim
mower for a farmer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not profitable, why even use it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope to conduct a profitability
analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like all experience now is so
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's useful for the farmer,
it has to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something I'm hoping to look at
in terms of a profitability analysis
[SPEAKER_05]: comparing the different treatment
combinations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Off the top of your head, which
combination of cover crop, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_11]: interim mowing, not interim mowing,
led to the highest yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Harry Betts oat treatment combined
with interim mowing at a seeding rate of
[SPEAKER_05]: 45,000 seeds per acre and a nitrogen rate
of 56 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare.
I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that and you'll get hopefully perfect
yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but maybe I should preface.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in the very early stages,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No-till organic corn is not widely
practiced, so that's why this stuff is
[SPEAKER_05]: important to maybe push it forward and
fill the gaps of knowledge that we have in
[SPEAKER_05]: this system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
