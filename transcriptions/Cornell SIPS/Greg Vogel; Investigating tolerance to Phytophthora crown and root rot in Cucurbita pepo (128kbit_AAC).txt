[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue our discussion of
Cucurbitipo and talk about the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing looking at resistance to
the disease phytophthora crown and root
[SPEAKER_00]: rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the causal agent of this disease is
phytophthora capsicii, which infects a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide variety of plants, including many
economically important vegetable crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as most solanaceous species,
all cucurbits, and some legumes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora capsicii can infect all plant
organs and causes different symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important of which I'm showing on
this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see fruit rot on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white growth that you see is the
pathogen sporulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm focusing on crown and root rot,
symptoms of which we see on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crown and root rot causes dampening of
symptoms in young seedlings, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: affects more mature plants, causing
lesions on the roots and stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: which lead to wilting and plant death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pepper, there are sources of very
high disease resistance that are used in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of work looking at
the genetics of disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but much less is known in cucurbitaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although many accessions of many cucurbit
species have been screened for either
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit rot resistance or root and crown rot
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a wide amount of variation in
terms of degree of susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: although there are very few cases of clear
complete resistance to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my work is focused on cucurbitipipo,
which, as we learned from Warren,
[SPEAKER_00]: includes zucchini and pumpkin,
among other market classes of squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cucurbitipipo, there are no sources
of complete resistance to this disease
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most cultivars are highly susceptible
to phytophthora root and crown rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at Cornell in the Mazurik lab,
in recent years, there's been work to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop pumpkin and zucchini lines with an
increased amount of resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora, crown, and root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most promising lines, which I'm
working with for my research, were derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from a cross between zucchini cultivar
Romulus, and a gray zucchini land race
[SPEAKER_00]: from the National Plant Germ Plasm System.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture we can see on the left,
one of the advanced lines compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible zucchini variety Dunja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these advanced lines are partially
resistant in that the disease progresses
[SPEAKER_00]: more slowly, and symptoms are reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still observe plant mortality on
many plants of these genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they perform better than the top
accessions from a previous study that
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated several hundred cucurbitipo germ
plasmic sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also challenged these breeding lines
with seven diverse pathogen isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response to disease is consistent,
indicating the absence of any isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: specific interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the goals of my research is to
identify loci that control resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora, crown, and root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, I've developed an F2
mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the parents and the F1 on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The susceptible parent is zucchini variety
Dunja.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle, we have the breeding line
that I previously identified as being most
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The figure on the right shows area under
the disease progress curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the parents and F1, area under the
disease progress curve is a measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease progression over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, using measurement of disease
incidence every other day for two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks following inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that the F1 is not intermediate
between the parents, but is closer in
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype to the susceptible parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also see that the differences
between the parents are robust to
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in inoculum concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're even inoculating the partially
resistant parent with a suspension of
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 zoos per mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observe less disease than on the
susceptible parent inoculated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension of 1,000 zoos per mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expect the genetic architecture of
this trait to be complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that in mind, we are employing
bulk segregate analysis with whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: resequencing of the bulks to map QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind this is straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of evaluating a large number
of plants, identifying the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: extremes, in this case, the most
susceptible and the most resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequencing those DNA pools from those
bulks, estimating allele frequencies
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-wide, and identifying regions that
differ in allele frequency between the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be several advantages in some
cases over traditional QTL mapping where
[SPEAKER_00]: all individuals are phenotyped and
genetyped separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because you're genetyping fewer
individuals, genetyping costs are lesser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotyping is also simpler in the sense
that instead of assigning a precise
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic score to all individuals,
it just requires the researcher to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the phenotypic extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be a statistical challenge in
separating signal in allele frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between bulks from sampling
noise from sequencing, but several methods
[SPEAKER_00]: have been developed that increase the
accuracy of allele frequency estimates at
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs by borrowing information from
neighboring markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide shows how I implemented this
approach in the F2 population I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I evaluated over 13,000 F2 seedlings by
spraying them with a suspension of
[SPEAKER_00]: phototheracapsidose cell spores and
identified bulks, not just a susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: and resistant bulk, but also a random bulk
to estimate baseline allele frequencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I attempted to have the bulks
constitute 15% of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection was applied in each 72 cell tray
plants were sowed in, so that corresponds
[SPEAKER_00]: to 11 plants in each tray being selected
for the bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tissue from the 11 plants was
bulks, DNA was extracted, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: currently quantifying it and standardizing
across 96 trays to end up with six DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: pools, the three bulks from both stages of
phenotyping that will shortly be submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: for sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also interested in the mechanisms that
allow plants of these partially resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: gene types to have a higher probability of
survival compared to other gene types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And previous work has shown that
structural and physical features in roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems are involved in resistance to
photothera-crown-rit rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a previous experiment using peppers
showed that photothera-capsidose cell
[SPEAKER_00]: spores were able to attach to and
germinate equally on roots of both
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible and resistant peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on susceptible peppers, the pathogen
was able to penetrate into the interior of
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, whereas on resistant gene types,
growth was limited to the outer cell
[SPEAKER_00]: layers of the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this summer was to help of an
undergraduate intern who worked on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a green fluorescent protein-tagged
isolate and confocal laser scanning
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy to look at the infection
process in both one of our partially
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant breeding lines, 17G009,
and the susceptible zucchini variety
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunja.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at 96 taproot cross-sections and
gave them a binary score of hyphae present
[SPEAKER_00]: or absent in the root and stem interiors
and in the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both three days post-inoculation and
six days post-inoculation, we observed a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher probability of observing hyphae in
either the interior or the vascular tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: in our susceptible variety Dunja.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still observed hyphae in a
potential portion of the partially
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is interesting because
whereas in the greenhouse, we observed
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of the Dunja plants to be dead
by seven days post-inoculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: by a couple of weeks post-inoculation,
we only observed 20% of the partially
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant breeding line to be dead,
although we observed many more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to have the pathogen present in the
interior of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that both penetration of the
pathogen is limited in the partially
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant genotype and that the plant's
able to continue to grow and survive
[SPEAKER_00]: despite infection for a period of time
compared to the susceptible variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next steps are, I'm currently
developing additional matting populations
[SPEAKER_00]: that I will use to validate any QTL that I
am able to detect in the book's arrogant
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and to estimate their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also hope to continue to do some
additional microscopy experiments and
[SPEAKER_00]: differential gene expression analysis to
further understand what makes a resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plant more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank the S.M.A
.R.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Gore Labs, my other members in my
committee, Michael Mazurek and Philip
[SPEAKER_00]: Messer, Kyle LaPlante and Mazurek Lab,
who I collaborate with on these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signation in the S.M.A.R.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab, Holly Lang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ella Reeves was the undergraduate who
worked on the microscopy experiments and
[SPEAKER_00]: funding from the New York State Department
of Agriculture and Markets and the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: National Institute of Food and
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions for Greg?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since PCAP doesn't have an airborne form,
you know, it seems like you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: more diversification or like the isolates
in Illinois would just be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different from those in New Jersey versus
something where the spores can spread a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are there lots of issues of
basically very specific resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: like being an issue to PCAP?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence in pepper for very
specific resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much evidence in privates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I evaluated, I looked at the response of
these arsenic resistant lions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly it's an isolates from New York,
but also a couple of isolates from the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response was the same in all
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said if some of the resistant plants
died and some didn't, do you have any
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal what the difference is in those
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there more high fee or could you tell
just what the cause was?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, I think there's kind of maybe a
threshold in terms of infection and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's variation in terms of how many
plants of the same genotype reach that
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold and end up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that in pepper as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm interested in maybe using Quantave
PCR to try to estimate adjunct abundance
[SPEAKER_00]: and associate that with survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's thank Greg and all the other
speakers.
