[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me this in 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time that I give a formal
talk here in front of my colleagues and my
[SPEAKER_00]: peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for having me doing
this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what I will show you is the
work that I have been done for the last 15
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20 years, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started this work when I was an
undergrad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a master's studying fossils
from Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had a lapse when I came here as a
postdoc, and then when it was time for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to reestablish my own research program,
I went back to Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is really important for me
is collaboration, and this is part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my colleagues from Argentina,
colleagues from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liz was a student here at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she is my collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague, Peter Wilf, he works in Penn
State, and of course my crew of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that help me when we are in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project is basically a
collaboration with several institutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just from Cornell and United States,
but also from Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that is important to
understand is why are fossils important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the things that we need to
concentrate is actually in the global
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity through the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that most people don't know is
that the northern hemisphere is
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized for being continental.
[SPEAKER_00]: What means that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that 30% of land is in the
northern hemisphere, 70% is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern hemisphere is characterized to be
being oceanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because only 6% of land masses is
what is formed in the southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you consider the part of land that
is between the two tropics, the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: hemisphere is represented by one to one
land and water, and the southern
[SPEAKER_00]: hemisphere is one to 16, so only one part
of land records 16% of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is interesting about this
is the fact that of the six considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be six hotspots for diversity fall into
the southern hemisphere, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually indicating that definitely
there's an asymmetry in the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and biomes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This latitudinal diversity, it's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just in the modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that equatorial peaks in the
species richness are typical not only for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they are also for terrestrial and
marine animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that has increased dramatically
through the Cretaceous to the Zenozoic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is because we have the great
appearance of the vascular plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperms and gymnosperms there,
and that we have various late Zenozoic to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neogene bicarians events that effectively
partition the tropics in centers of high
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see these peaks since the
Ordovician, they are coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they peak actually with the appearance
of the flowering plants during some place
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Cretaceous around 140 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened with the Americas?
[SPEAKER_00]: This talk is about Patagonia, so I'm
trying to go towards there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened with the Americas?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, it has approximately
10 million square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 7% of the global diversity at the
angiosperm level, and 1.4 are considered
[SPEAKER_00]: to be endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look at Brazil,
that is smaller than the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually carries 20% of the global
diversity of those 66% are endemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know that it's a fact that around
40% of the Amazon basin has never been
[SPEAKER_00]: sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we expect to have much more
endemic plants there than we know up to
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened with Argentina,
where Patagonia is located?
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina is actually almost one third of
the size of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only has 3% of the global angiosperm
diversity and has 0.5% of endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you consider these half of the size
is approximately has the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: endemics that the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we observe these diversity asymmetry
also if we look at the Americas in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from South America, it's
important for me to explain what South
[SPEAKER_00]: America is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less, we have 90,000 vascular
planted species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of which in Antarctica only has two of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But South America and Antarctica are
really critical, are extremely critical to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and comprehend several factors
about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, explain the direction and flow of
the dispersion and migration routes of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and also animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain the radiation and dominance of the
angiosperms in the southern hemisphere in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also helps to interpret the distant
model of the modern astral distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because South America was part
of the big continent called Gondwana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to show you, Antarctica is during
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has only 2% free of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the coldest, windiest, and driest
desert on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has only two vascular plants,
columbatus, which is in the Cariophiliaeae
[SPEAKER_00]: and the champsha, which is a grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina is only 1,000 miles exactly for
the Antarctic Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only 1,600 kilometers from the
Antarctic Peninsula to the southernmost
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Argentina, which is Ushuaia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it has high diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has families that are represented 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have approximately 2,000 genera and
around 9,000 species of vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of these 1,800 are endemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are only found in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is Patagonia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Patagonia is basically the largest 1,000
miles of the southernmost tip of South
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be largely inhabited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the population is around four people
per kilometer square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go there, mostly you don't see
people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you divide Patagonia using the Andes,
you will have two different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The step or the Patagonian step,
which is actually flat, dry plain,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly are grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the border with Chile
and the Andes, what you will see are
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain sides that are covered by
rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have the numerous glaciers
that extend on both sides, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentinian side and the Chilean side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term Patagonia comes from actually
the first Spaniards that arrived there
[SPEAKER_00]: around 1500s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw these big Indians called
Tehuelches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Tehuelches were very tall men,
up to two meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look higher and taller due to the
fact that they wear a lot of pelts from
[SPEAKER_00]: guanacos to cover themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because they use those to cover
their feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they see, the footsteps that the
Spaniards saw were the ones used by these
[SPEAKER_00]: natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name Patagonia comes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Charles Darwin, during the big
old trip with Fitzroyd in commanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: landed in Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only 24 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first impression of Patagonia was
exactly this, is the surface in white
[SPEAKER_00]: level and is composed of well-rounded
single mix with the whitest earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here and there is covered top of brown
wire grass are supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still really some low thorny
bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually that's exactly what Patagonia
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a huge, this is prepared Kevin,
this is one of Kevin's slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it's just to show that that
was his vision is not how Patagonia is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patagonia is extremely rich in vascular
plants and extremely endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different types of biomes and
just I will show you only a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you materials from the step
and materials that you will see close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Valdivian forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were looking at the step,
extent flora, oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were looking at the side of the
Andes, what you will see are these
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular views.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mostly big lakes with volcanoes,
covered by beautiful forest of Nothopagus
[SPEAKER_00]: and Guemáñez and Calcúvias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you have the chance,
you can see the Perito Moreno Glacier,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the most active glaciers
in modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the endemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in Botrun in Protiasi,
we have Nothopagiasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luma is a mutation, which lack of bark as
many of them mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the typical Araucaria in the
Araucaria, Escalonia and Dreamies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to the step, you have the
opportunity to see, meanwhile you are
[SPEAKER_00]: walking, penguins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see also other kind of wildlife,
such as marines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it went out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also see different type of
bushes and brushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those are these.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Larea in the Stigopilaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beautiful legumes at our natural
film.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some of the most spectacular
cacti.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are endemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Chupiraga, which is one of the
composites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These next two slides are photos that I
took, meanwhile I was walking from the
[SPEAKER_00]: track to one of my sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a walk of less than one
kilometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really very rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking down, Patagonia has all
kind of bushes and brushes, but the trick
[SPEAKER_00]: is to look on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see things like a ephedra,
Ochsaly-daceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see tropaliaeaceae like Ar Face第二wade
arface in the Colihuahua.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the endemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other cacti, asorellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loaceaceae, another composite,
Apiaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: another ones like Enothera, a bunch of
legumes, and several monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is charged from the walk from the
track to one of my sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flora is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, also meanwhile, you are
collecting, you are really lucky on seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as condors, guanacos, penguins,
and rias, these are flightless birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did Patagonia reach the high
diversity, the present flora?
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer that question, definitely,
we need to look at the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils are extremely important,
not just to check for endemics or not just
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain modern distribution,
but they actually provide additional
[SPEAKER_00]: information to assess homology and
evolutionary change through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also provide character evidence that
affect our phylogenetic conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we do is include
all these fossils within the phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps us to understand modern
relationships, not child's past
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils also help to estimate the minimal
ages of certain clays that the are present
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those definitely are the best source
for calibration for molecular dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, they also help to understand the
evidence of past distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they can aid us to understand
bioregographic histories, not only from
[SPEAKER_00]: the past, but also from the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have several papers in which we've
been utilizing the fossil record to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: different questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we provide a list of monocots
that are suitable for molecular dating
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also study the senozoic biogeographical
evolution of woody plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are able to understand phylogenetic
bioconservatism if we look at the fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: record comparing them with extra material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we are able to do some
testing to impact of how we do calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments using fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fossils really are key for any kind of
study that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research questions, these are the
big research questions that we have in my
[SPEAKER_00]: group, are basically based on Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions we have is,
was Patagonia a refuge from the aim of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous Max extinction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, during the KPG boundary
was a mass extinction, many vertebrates
[SPEAKER_00]: group disappear, many plants disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the event is completely different
in the Northern Hemisphere than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we have that differences in
the top, the Northern Hemisphere being
[SPEAKER_00]: continental, the Southern Hemisphere being
oceanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the composition, diversity,
and biogeographic affinities of early
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleocenaeus in Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we have mass extinction at the
end of the Cretaceous, we need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something at the beginning of the
Paleogene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are interested in Denian flora,
which is the most basal part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleogene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we are very
lucky is because we have the only Denian
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Southern Hemisphere represented in
Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these flora contain lineages that
now survive South America, Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, as well as past relations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they document the early phases of South
American isolation by showing a loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: conguana taxa and increasing the new world
taxa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are evolutionary processes registered in
the fossil record?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we attempt to
answer, but not today will be impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to answer all those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are working towards answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the journey starts much before we get
to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we start collecting information
and checking geological maps here in my
[SPEAKER_00]: library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we are lucky enough that United
doesn't cancel my flight from Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to arrive to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I fly all the way to
Buenos Aires.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Buenos Aires, I fly again to a small
town called Trelleu, where my colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Museo Paleontológico de Guido
Peruglio, or MEF, are housed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I spend most of my time
when I go to Argentina before leaving to
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Trelleu, you have the chance
to stop in the touring club.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the touring club in around 1900,
this is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is where Batchica City and the
Sundance Kid stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stay in the room, it charge you a
little extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sit also at the table where George
Simpson writes some of his books.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a visitor there for several years
in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, you can also sit at the table
where Antoine Hexanec-Supéry wrote part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Little Prince book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do all those things when you go
to Trelleu, plus work in the collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We work at the collections first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get ready to go to the field,
so we carry everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry from the water, food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before leaving from the field,
we take pictures, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we drive and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we get into situations where
it's dubious if you can pass with the
[SPEAKER_00]: truck or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to after three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tracks breaks, there's not a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to come up to the occasion and
everybody works to try to fix the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucky enough, you can maybe arrive on time
to set your tent, which will be your house
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the wind doesn't blow,
that's the tent where you will have
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully some dinners and lunches,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we never go out of the field without
having a dinosaur detector, as was
[SPEAKER_00]: suggested by the people in Jurassic Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we keep an eye open if we
see bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very lucky to find not too long
ago bones of one of the largest dinosaurs
[SPEAKER_00]: in Patagonia and on the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concentration, we are working in many
different paleofluoras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just mention three of them today
because these are the most spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be talking about La Colonia
Formation, which is that one that is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the K-Pg boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the companion to Mastrichtian in age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Salamanca Formation, which is Danian,
that puts us in the early Paleocene around
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Tupolita Laguna de Lunko,
which is basically a tuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just tuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just ashes and ashes and ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tupolita Laguna de Lunko is compared
to what you have in Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be one of the largest
mega calderas for the Eocene worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, the age of that Tupolita is
Iprision, which is an early Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we are looking is from
La Colonia to the Salamanca to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupolita Laguna de Lunko.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is where you will have the K-Pg
boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, I don't want to overwhelm
you with geology, but this is just to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you how the Southern Hemisphere look in
polar view during a specific time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is around the Mastrichtian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, we have still the
Lugongwana start to break around the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jurassic, but major movements started from
the Triassic all the way to modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the reconstruction for the
Mastrichtian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brief reconstruction for the
Danian.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for the Eocene, which is the Iprision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, this is today's
reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I want to point it
out here is that at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: this point and these points, we didn't
have the circumpolar correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the temperature at that point was still
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we heat the Eocene, what we are
heating is the maximal thermal during the
[SPEAKER_00]: tertiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is important because it's when we
start to change different type of taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will see that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we are in the field, we continue
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drop the cars there, and then we walk
to the sediments where we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not vacation time like most people
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry heavy machinery to break the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you can see here we have a
rotary saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have what is called a quarry,
which is the place where we work at where
[SPEAKER_00]: fossils, we do a lot of on-hand activities
just using the pick and shovels and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning the quarry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obtain rocks, and we pick the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divide the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clean the fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select the fossils in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we leave a clean quarry for
the following day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a clean quarry helps you to do
paleoecological studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take every single fossil that every
single fossil that we excavate is recorded
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow us to do physiognomic analysis,
which basically allow us to calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, based on those characters,
we also are able to produce maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these studies are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the metals that we use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the fossils are collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it to the collections,
and there the fossils are prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the standard methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have little tools that help
us to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we are able to obtain pollen
grains in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are studied with TEM and SEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to include all our fossils
within a phylogenetic context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we do is a total
evidence approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, we use matrices that have
already provided, that have already
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not, we produce our own
morphological matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We combine those with molecular data that
we obtain from GeneBank and other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we find that we need some
key tags that needs to be explored for the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even do our own extraction of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of the things that we
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use maximum persimmon, and we use
maximum likelihood on all our projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, fossils can not be included,
and we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methodology that we use is
basically to go to our volume sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: compare what do we have there,
and try to figure it out where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: place these fossils in what families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of modern taxonomy or
systematics of these groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the colonial formation, our crops in
the Somunkura Massif, is considered to be
[SPEAKER_00]: upper Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that is important is
for all the formations that we present
[SPEAKER_00]: today, we have a very good determined age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the age in this case is 65 to 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on many chronostachographic
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the formation is 72
million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has three different facies,
which means three different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments where the fossils were
deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is important here is that all our
fossils come from the lower and middle
[SPEAKER_00]: facies, which are represented by coastal
freshwater lakes or freshwater lagoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will not show you all the fossils
today, but I want to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the fossils that we have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are represented by the family
Salviniaceae, which is aquatic fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixonaceae is also ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several conifers, but the most
prominent one are from the family
[SPEAKER_00]: Araucariaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the first and oldest record of
Nelumboleaceae, which is an aquatic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have palms, the family Araucariaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tifaceae, also is considered to be
an offshore kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several dicots and monocot leaf
morphotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we have an extremely rich
palinoflora, which is basically pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: grains and spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will show you just a couple of
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very proud of the Azolla because
this is the oldest record worldwide of a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we have the sporophytes and we
have the sporocarps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those inside the sporocarps,
this is the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the sporocarps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to pull out the megaspores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each megaspore has stick to it the
microspores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those microspores are represented by
these little things here and this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: type of extension of the wall called the
glochidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glochidia are fundamental for the
microspore to reach the floaters of the
[SPEAKER_00]: megaspore and then copulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marsiliaceae is also an aquatic fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small family with three
genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have here, this is represented very
close to the genus Marsiliaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has four leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the four leaflets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we also find the
sporocarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Regnelidium, which is endemic of a
small area in Brazil, Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Argentina, has a rich fossil record in
the northern hemisphere, not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we found it in, oops,
we found it in La Colonia with the two
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these sporocarps yield the megaspores,
which are called molaspora, when you find
[SPEAKER_00]: it that is not associated, and
chrysveleporitis, which are these ones
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the oldest records for the
family Marsiliaceae worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Salamanca formation belongs to a
completely different formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basin is the San Jorge basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that is Danian is really well
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The age is the only southern hemisphere
Danian sediment is represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: estuarine deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we know is that
has one of the most fantastic invertebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: flora, invertebrate fauna, and among them
is one of the richest for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a rich palino flora,
but the mega flora is almost unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because we have a lot of
angiosperm morphotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that we don't know
where to put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formation was discovered many,
many years ago, but it's still,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started sampling around the 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we got the oldest record
for the Arikaceae represented by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atelini sub-tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, I'm sorry, those are actually
the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, they have the three
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have only two pores and these are the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extended distribution of the Atelini is
this area, northern part of Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we did a phylogenetic analysis
and is placed within the clade of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atelini.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, this is work with Nathan,
my actual, my postdoc at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the oldest record of
Ramnaceae worldwide as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flower and it's characterized by
being pentamerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very distinctive type of
calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the clocuculate and marginate
petals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the family is today work well
distributed, but the fossil record is not
[SPEAKER_00]: very abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we included a phylogenetic context
and it fits within the sisyphoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are found today in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also found Cunoniesae,
which is a typical southern hemisphere
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Argentina, we have only four genera,
Clacruvia, Eucryphia, Lamannonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Weimania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this one, this flower,
that varies the number of parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sepals are three and have a very
distinctive type of venation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing are the
petals, which are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is characteristic of one of the
groups within the, within the family and
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Eskiseaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found the pollen grains within the
anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we included a phylogenetic context
and is placed as the sister of the crown
[SPEAKER_00]: group Eskisomerae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because later on I
will show you another fossil that belongs
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Cunoniesae, this is Cunoniasa
bicarpelata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we found the distinctive
Cunoniesae morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found the pollen grains in situ here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the pollen grains of
Weimania and Clacruvia, which are two of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genera that grows in Argentina today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was included in the
phylogenetic context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one feeds as the core in the base
of the core of the whole Cunoniesae.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the Tufolitas Laguna del Unco?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered to be one of the largest
volcanic pyroclastic complex worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fossil comes from Tufatius mats,
and these are representing caldera-like
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits, exactly the same as if today
Yellowstone would erupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly the age, 52 million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually one of the highest
paleobiotas worldwide and is the richest
[SPEAKER_00]: years in flora worldwide, even comparing
with the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found pteridophytes, gymnosperms,
and several angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the gymnosperms as
retrofilum in the Podocarpaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: Popoacetros, agathis in the
Araucariaeaeae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agathis is totally extinct in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only found in certain areas of
Australasia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Gingoides, and this is the
cuticle, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last record of Gingoides
worldwide, and this is the one that gave
[SPEAKER_00]: origin to the Gingos that we know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Austrosamia, which is in
the Cicadaeaeaeae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among those, we found the oldest record of
Eucalyptus, and one of the things that is
[SPEAKER_00]: important is we have a whole plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the leaves with the typical type
of venation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the fruits that are the capsules
that have the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the flowers, we were able to
obtain pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pollen grains are, if you find
them isolated, as Myrtiazidides,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eucalyptoides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the type that is considered to
be the precursor of the genus Eucalyptus,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we are included in a
phylogenetic context.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is isolated Myrtiazidides,
and as we can see, the Patagonian fossils
[SPEAKER_00]: are placed within the genus Eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other cunoniesis that we
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, remember, this is tertiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This belongs, again, to the tribe
Schizomere.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other cunoniesis that are being
studied at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, this is modern way
mania.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are characterized by having these
capsules that open with two bulbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have the remnants of the styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this one is one of those
with this typical opening with the styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have another one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are totally two different types of
fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the typical panicle, and this is a
typical raceme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cunoniesis was much more
diverse than what we have today in living.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also fossils of the juglandesi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are nutlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these allow us to actually,
we did a CT scan, to actually observe that
[SPEAKER_00]: the embryos and the cotyledons are
separated in four, and they are together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's key to determine if these belong to
juglandesi or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we included in a phylogenetic
context, and it fits within the
[SPEAKER_00]: Engelgardioidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Engelgardioidae are represented today
in the northern part of South America and
[SPEAKER_00]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we have Solanesi that was
really important because Solanesi are
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly herbaceous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a very important group for crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found this beautiful preserve very
similar to the modern, some of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: genera, and in this case, very similar to
the fruits that are produced by Isalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The family is today worldwide distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the origin of the family is
the South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is that we were able
to infer that probably they were
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed, they were dispersed by the
rivers because these have the syndrome of
[SPEAKER_00]: the floating calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we place it, I don't expect for you
to read this, but we place it here within
[SPEAKER_00]: the core of Isalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have actually northern connections
and southern connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the northern connection,
this is the, actually this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mastectium, that's how you will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Regnelidium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Marcella, the Azolla.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grains of, this is actually
aspargania cepolinitis, which is a type
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Araceae, this is the oldest
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the genus Pandanitis, which is an
Araceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is proving actually that we find also
the mega fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are aquatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we have Notopahididas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have southern connection is indicated
also by this fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the genus Thodia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Agathis in the Araucariaeaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Juglandaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Gymnostoma, which is
Casuarineaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today this is totally extinct in Argentina
and only grows in certain parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Eucalyptus and we have several
Cunoniaeaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this information, what we can
say actually is that we can observe
[SPEAKER_00]: certain evolutionary processes such as
extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have Agathis or Eucalyptus or
Casuarineaceae anymore in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are, all of those are
represented by the oldest record.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Eocene of Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also an expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Salvinelis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the aquatic ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Araceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Notopahididas, Cunoniaeaceae,
and Procheaceae, which have expanded based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fossil record to other areas of
South America and the Southern Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have definitely retraction of several
taxa such as Araceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember if we have here the palms and now
they are restricted to these areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are really retracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the paleontology, we can say the
same about the family Rubiaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there are several things that
are explaining disjunction models such as
[SPEAKER_00]: the family Winteraceae and Araucaraceae,
which have disjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some of those in the northern part
of Argentina and some in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, I want to make sure that
you know that actually fossils are really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical and they provide an unprecedented
wealth of information, not only on
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous and Tertiary flora,
but also if we compare them with extant
[SPEAKER_00]: flora to understand certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide knowledge on past Southern
distribution, which is critical for
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding modern global distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember the first slide,
I said there was an asymmetry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude and gradients of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is proving that that is actually
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: These paleofloras are certain relevant for
explaining modern high-diversity centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evolutionary processes are really
detected in the paleofluoristic record of
[SPEAKER_00]: Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of you, we need to celebrate
the past to awaken the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because genomic information is
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecular data is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we have the other components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, if we don't study the
taxonomy, past distribution, modern
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, we are missing a lot of
critical information that help us to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand actually the value of that
genomic and molecular data.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been funded by several agencies,
NSF, MEF, Fulbright, and Conicet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing of this can be done without the
staff of the museum and people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has a fantastic herbarium,
which I use quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot do this work if we didn't have
access to all of our sites and to my two
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures of the fossils are so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you briefly tell us how you go from
finding a rock to making those pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a task.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we really clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that in the field, we get the big rocks
and we treat them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't carry all that away to the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These collections are approximately,
Laguna de Lungo has more than 8,000
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do later is when we get into
the lab, we trim them again and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: special tools to treat them two
dimensionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if possible, we wash them with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, we just put it under
cameras and take the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things that are this thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you go back to the slide with
your summary that had the map and pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the different directions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to spend a little bit more time
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go all the way down and then I go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was thinking about the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the expansion, do you see any sort
of strong directionality as to the
[SPEAKER_01]: north-south direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I don't have the time to
explain all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happened is based on the
position of Patagonia during this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was still connected to Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are doing is actually we are
missing all the record for Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the peninsula and several of the
islands that are close to the Antarctic
[SPEAKER_00]: Peninsula during the summer, you can go
and collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few works that have been
done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in the 1900s with the trips of
Northern Hall with the boat called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: His father was a geologist, so early on in
his life, although he was a person that
[SPEAKER_00]: was interested in hunting whales,
and that's why they did the trip with
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica, he was interested in
collecting rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he collected, actually, a bunch of
fossils that are considered now today the
[SPEAKER_00]: prototype for the oldest records for
Northopagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were studied in Sweden by Dusen,
which is a very famous paleopodanist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are materials there, and we are
trying to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everything goes OK, maybe in a
couple of years, I will be going there and
[SPEAKER_00]: collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about this is that we
will have the whole sequence from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Maastrichtian all the way, actually,
to the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very interesting things
happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Miocene flora, two big floras,
in Tierra del Fuego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are critical because that's when
almost all the species of Northopagus are
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Northopagus goes this way,
but actually, the oldest record is pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: grains from the Maastrichtian of
Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask another question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when do you start to see the
current habitats coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it looks like it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last big thing that appeared were
the Andes, that they started to elevate
[SPEAKER_00]: during the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end is when we start to see
already the area, already the diagonal
[SPEAKER_00]: already established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still, the biggest changes are mostly
observed after the PTEM, the
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the geological aspects,
that's when the current, the Antarctic
[SPEAKER_00]: current, start to be more prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's when during the Oligocene,
you start to observe the curve already,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperatures start to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the beginning of the Oligocene is
when you start to see the glaciation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those things are affecting what you
are getting into Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based not only in the data I
presented today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are many, many examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, with the Northopagus,
we start to observe when Northopagus
[SPEAKER_00]: appears, also Mesodendrasia start to
appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that Mesodendron is actually
symbiotic with Northopagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows only on Northopagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to observe as well those kind
of events.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you saw almost all the major clades in
Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the diversification of that
order happened in Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually kind of new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is southern
hemisphere is considered to be extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: under-sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many biases of why this is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, again, is oceanic is not considered
to be continental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not too many land where you
can go and look for fossil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is, for example, you have
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa doesn't have almost any sedimentary
rocks, which is where you find the fossil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then until not too many years ago,
nobody was interested in what was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the southern hemisphere
because you could explain everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: studying things in the northern
hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the original paleobotanist,
we are from the northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that these flores were
collected until the 50s was based on all
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they send the geologists to prospect
for oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collect some fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring them to the United States,
and they study them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the 50s, that was the
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the 50s, 1950s, the thing started to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more people were more involved in
other aspects of paleobotany, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect that we will find actually more
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have the genus Paleoasola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paleoasola has actually three
megaspores that we consider that are
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any doubt, it belongs to
Salvinielles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an aquatic farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all those things that we
still need to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alejandro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
