University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell and I am
with Steve Reiners, a professor of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture and the statewide vegetable
specialist at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we will talk about a practice
that is usually done in cucurbit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't know if it is the right
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve, whenever we have a disease like
Downy Melio, people think of pruning their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a good practice and
how is it done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of chatter about this
and gardening websites recently about
[SPEAKER_01]: going out and pruning your squash or your
zucchini.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got some plants here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are actually in really good
shape, but the idea of pruning would be
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to just leave the sort of
newer growth that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that right in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to touch that,
but it would be basically going down and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting these older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting those out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now again, these are in pretty good shape,
but normally these would have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could throw them right into the
compost pile and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do even a little bit more
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could cut this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people are concerned that when
you cut a leaf like that, it leaves this
[SPEAKER_01]: big hole that you can see right in there
and the insects could get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is, I don't think there's
going to be any insects that would cause a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some insects might get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could open it up for disease maybe,
but for the most part, what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen is by taking these leaves off,
it's going to put an end to all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is just a kind of a way to
rejuvenate the plant so that you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: more zucchini if you really want more
zucchini later in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this big root system that's
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you cut these leaves off,
you've got a lot of energy coming up from
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots to push out these new leaves and
you can get a nice harvest then in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a practice that you would
recommend as a professor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really wanted to talk about it
because people seem to be recommending it
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never done commercially, so a farmer
would never want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also recommend wear gloves and
long sleeves because these leaves can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little irritating on your arms and your
hands too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we just learned about pruning and
how it's done and the way that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: more harvest if we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
