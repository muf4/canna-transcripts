[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell University
Glad to have you all here at the 13th
[SPEAKER_04]: annual Cornell Corteva plant breeding
symposium I know this symposium has been
[SPEAKER_04]: the highlight for a lot of plant breeding
graduate students here at Cornell over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years and we're so glad that We get to be
part of the the larger Corteva symposia
[SPEAKER_04]: series Every year our plant breeding
graduate Student organization synapsis
[SPEAKER_04]: gets to vote on what our theme is And this
year we chose something that was you know
[SPEAKER_04]: relevant to our students and that they
thought was important This year our topic
[SPEAKER_04]: is plant breeding for novel systems and
complex problems We hope that this
[SPEAKER_04]: symposium will highlight Some of the
examples of how plant breeders are using
[SPEAKER_04]: out-of-the-box approaches or cutting-edge
methods to adapt crops to unique systems
[SPEAKER_04]: The symposium will not be possible without
this synapsis symposium planning committee
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to take a moment to thank my
co-chair Sam And also our other committee
[SPEAKER_04]: members Tim Vaswati and Srikanth who
unfortunately couldn't be here today if
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the symposium you have any
questions You can try to find one of us
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll try to help you I'd also like to
thank Cornell for the continued support of
[SPEAKER_04]: this symposium and also BTI for hosting us
again and then of course Corteva for
[SPEAKER_04]: founding the series and continuing to fund
us and support us I wanted to thank the
[SPEAKER_01]: organizing committee for inviting me to
come speak I've been involved with the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Minnesota's symposium series
for three years and so it's really come
[SPEAKER_01]: full circle to be invited speaker here My
talk today will be a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: than some of the others and the fact that
this is volunteer work that myself and a
[SPEAKER_01]: large team of graduate students have done
and so this is just some of the names of
[SPEAKER_01]: the second and third cohort of our group
Really want to emphasize that this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: team-based activity A little bit of
background about where is the need,
[SPEAKER_01]: where is the objective of our group and so
in 2016 this article was published about
[SPEAKER_01]: Minneapolis farmers market I might let you
guys read the first quote there and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would summarize in saying that there is a
large need for these traditional African
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables that there are community
members driving up to eight hours away for
[SPEAKER_01]: these specific vegetables and even then
they're not getting everything they have
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running out on time and so I might
pose a question to you if you move to a
[SPEAKER_01]: new country what will you do if you cannot
find broccoli or carrots you could adapt
[SPEAKER_01]: to the local cultural vegetables or maybe
you could bring your own vegetables here
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I might pose a greater question to
the group here are we as plant breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: are you all as plant breeders meeting the
needs and demands in a more socially
[SPEAKER_01]: equitable way and so to give a little
background about where we are in Minnesota
[SPEAKER_01]: as a whole within Minnesota around nine
percent of the residents were not born in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States most of those live
within the Twin Cities and of those around
[SPEAKER_01]: 150,000 list Africa as a region of origin
and so our group really focusing on West
[SPEAKER_01]: and East Africa communities from these
regions and within the pie chart up here I
[SPEAKER_01]: might highlight we have large populations
within Twin Cities from Nigeria,
[SPEAKER_01]: Liberia, more in the West Africa more in
East Africa, Kenya, and Somalia and this
[SPEAKER_01]: figure on the bottom just shows that over
time within the last recent five,
[SPEAKER_01]: ten years the proportion of foreign-born
people within Minnesota from Africa is
[SPEAKER_01]: really increasing the most and so to
introduce our team our main mission is to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring together researchers, growers,
and students to develop culturally
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant food plants towards Minnesota
this is a picture of our group of the
[SPEAKER_01]: current iteration the current cohort a lot
of our group has really been modeled after
[SPEAKER_01]: scope out of UC Davis this more
participatory volunteer work of graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: students are one of our main goals is to
eventually release culturally relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables that are specifically adapted
to a Minnesota climate so a quarter a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter growing season cooler evenings
cooler springs and our group was started
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2021 and this is a picture of it and
just to yeah highlight this is all
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteer work so some of our main
collaborators that we work with that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have learned in a mutual learning
environment so Chidi Tribose is our main
[SPEAKER_01]: one he is with the Hennepin County Master
Gardeners that's one of the main counties
[SPEAKER_01]: within the Twin Cities and he is in charge
of the DEI within the Master Gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: group there other collaborators highlight
would be Ngozi, Natalie Hoidal is with UMN
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension and Zachary Page who runs a
non-profit seed production business so we
[SPEAKER_01]: are partnering with them to actually
produce seeds to get to the community to
[SPEAKER_01]: give a little broad highlight about what
participatory plant breeding is or even in
[SPEAKER_01]: our context what it is so some of the main
questions would be who defines the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding goals sometimes the scientists
would sometimes the community would and so
[SPEAKER_01]: in our in our vision of participatory
plant breeding we are not the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: designing the goals we do not know these
vegetables intrinsically and so we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with not for the community to
develop that and so Frank talked about G
[SPEAKER_01]: by E by M we really think about this as G
by E by C so the context the rule that
[SPEAKER_01]: people play within developing varieties
and so our target environment would be
[SPEAKER_01]: home gardeners or small-scale producers
within the greater Twin Cities area and
[SPEAKER_01]: just to highlight a little more about that
context that context can even be
[SPEAKER_01]: subdivided into regional specificity so we
have certain vegetables that depending if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an East and West African the EU
types are quite drastic quite opposing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then even when you dive down we what we
are really doing is more participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: variety selection and so participatory
plant breeding where the community is
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in every step of the breeding
program we're not there yet we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: walking before we are running and so we
are screening diverse germplasm we are
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting varieties with the eventual goal
to have that variety have these EU types
[SPEAKER_01]: of form more traditional breeding pipeline
and so some of the ways that participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding does really well is really
ideal for is in these highly heterogeneous
[SPEAKER_01]: environments okay home gardeners within
the Twin Cities every garden will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: different set of conditions when advanced
technologies are limited or might even
[SPEAKER_01]: change that not limited but not wanted so
a lot of our communities really do not
[SPEAKER_01]: want hybrid vegetables do not want
genetically modified in any capacity and
[SPEAKER_01]: lastly to a broad range of stakeholders so
when we first started we did a situational
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis okay where we are what are the
priorities and so in our priority setting
[SPEAKER_01]: we said we really want to focus on leafy
greens there are a large number of African
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables out there there are fruit that
have an okay ability to ship there are
[SPEAKER_01]: small grains that should have a very good
ability to ship but we really focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: these leafy greens these vegetables that
really need to be produced locally that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen that need for within the farmers
markets and one of the ways we did that is
[SPEAKER_01]: look like are there existing varieties for
some of our species the answer is no you
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot get these seeds anywhere online in
the US and so in sort of the context of
[SPEAKER_01]: how they're used they're always cooked and
that's one of the weaknesses that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to develop building our
relationships with home cooks and so
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the stakeholder preference we
have hosted several open houses farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: days we really ask the people these
communities what do you want most of this
[SPEAKER_01]: learning is done through verbal
communication and so these are some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: highlights of what they are interested in
they're not interested in hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables they want to be able to save
their own seed they are not interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically engineered which most
vegetables are not and this third one here
[SPEAKER_01]: was really is currently a large challenge
for us to try to overcome there's no IP
[SPEAKER_01]: rights that you really don't own a
cultural statement and so a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: work really aligns close with the open
source seed initiative and lastly quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is much more preferred over yield that
these food aspects the taste the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: the texture of these vegetables is so
intrinsically important and lastly there
[SPEAKER_01]: are greater cultural functions some of
these vegetables on the right up here is
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter leaf it's a bitter leaf is a tree
forming asteraceae one of those bitter
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves you can ever taste really used in a
medicinal way and so what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring to the table as student as
volunteers in this mutual learning aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we have access to resources at the
University of Minnesota we have
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses we have field equipment we
have the space we have the volunteer
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to really form this as a center
and within the last couple years we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: community garden and a demo garden on
campus these are in organically managed
[SPEAKER_01]: fields on campus and lastly we have access
to genetic material so we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: before there's really no in some instances
ability to order these seeds online as
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers we have access to grin but
grin is not available to general public
[SPEAKER_01]: and so in some ways we're just serving as
a repository to that seed as well as other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources are important such as the World
Vegetable Center in Taiwan and some cases
[SPEAKER_01]: we act as seed multiplication we had a
farmer give to us African eggplant seed he
[SPEAKER_01]: actually lost his entire collection and we
still had a backup of that and we're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide him some of that seed and we
talked about mutual learning a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventual our eventual goal is to
release a variety we have come really
[SPEAKER_01]: close with one of our crops called jute
mallow but i'll highlight that in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit so going a little bit about how do we
get there how do we as volunteers actually
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish this most of this is
relationship building relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: building is integral it's slow but it's
effective so we in the last four years we
[SPEAKER_01]: have voted most 90 percent of our time on
this relationship building less on the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual breeding of these vegetables most
of this is done by word of mouth it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: our place to spam out emails to a long
list sir we are interested in the public
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually the percentage of the
communities actually want to work with us
[SPEAKER_01]: so within that there's a strong emphasis
on participation of knowledge rich rich
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders and goes he is one of them as
well as cheating and recognizing that a
[SPEAKER_01]: small subject subset do not want our
involvement that in the past university of
[SPEAKER_01]: minnesota has misappropriated some species
and that that resentment is very real and
[SPEAKER_01]: so we are working with the communities
that are interested in working with us and
[SPEAKER_01]: so some of the ways that we do that we
provide seeds to community gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout between cities we are really
narrowing our focus to a smaller subset
[SPEAKER_01]: within the greater african leafy
vegetables and in some cases there are
[SPEAKER_01]: just a real lack of available accessions
and so we have a small project work on
[SPEAKER_01]: creating genetic diversity through
mutagenesis we send a small subset of seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the nuclear reactor at uc davis for
mutagenesis diversity generation and so
[SPEAKER_01]: how does our group actually accomplish
these building relationships relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: within the community we host a very large
open house every year we have a booth at
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic specialty field day and just a
lot of reflective looking back is our
[SPEAKER_01]: language is our goals aligned properly we
get feedback from dei we participate in
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences two years ago we wrote a guide
to actually growing these emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and a one award at the american
society of horticulture meetings and we
[SPEAKER_01]: also are out with the community in these
farmers market i believe we've attended
[SPEAKER_01]: six farmers markets last year just getting
our name out spreading that word of mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: and so i want to highlight one in
particular our field day so our field day
[SPEAKER_01]: was a great success we had around 125
participants come to our plot on campus
[SPEAKER_01]: and so one of the ways that we connect
with people is over food food is so
[SPEAKER_01]: essential so part of the of the cultural
identity so the top left we had a potluck
[SPEAKER_01]: style dinner before we actually went to
the field people the community were
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to were encouraged to bring food
we had taste testing on here of all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties or this variety selection at the
end of the day we had a giving garden
[SPEAKER_01]: people were able to take home large
quantities of these vegetables trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: cook for themselves and here's just some
pictures of the actual field day and so
[SPEAKER_01]: very briefly talking about some of our
focus species we're working on jute mallow
[SPEAKER_01]: so jute mallow same plant made for jute
fiber but in a vegetable crop crop so
[SPEAKER_01]: these are different germplasm pool as a
leafy green ethiopian mustard so brassica
[SPEAKER_01]: carinata also an oil seed but we are
really focusing on the vegetable aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: that uh cleomey also known as spider wisp
um and amaranth and just to highlight a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about some of the idiotypes
that we're working with some of these we
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to flower earlier so for jute
mallow really will not flower in time from
[SPEAKER_01]: minnesota they'll produce seed pods that
they won't mature and so these are real
[SPEAKER_01]: tangible goals that we can increase the
flowering time where conversely with
[SPEAKER_01]: ethiopian mustard we want to delay that
flowering time it bolts too soon it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: leafy vegetable it makes great seed
production but as soon as it bolts so the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers the leaves turn more bitter so
these are aspects that are tangible we
[SPEAKER_01]: feel within our focus species so to
highlight some of the current challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have one of the main challenges we
ran to is just the common names so common
[SPEAKER_01]: names are useful but they're clunky and
recognizing that some common names come
[SPEAKER_01]: from very challenging history so for
example cowpea is the name given by slave
[SPEAKER_01]: owners by colonizers that demotes a crop
for humans to nothing more than a fodder
[SPEAKER_01]: for livestock and within the greater
scientific community cowpea is still the
[SPEAKER_01]: main word used and so we use that while
recognizing that different language is
[SPEAKER_01]: really needed moving on to some of the
other challenges some of our focus species
[SPEAKER_01]: have 20 plus common names when we are
writing our grower guide how do we choose
[SPEAKER_01]: what name goes on this guide without
leaving out certain communities and
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizing that a real subset of our
audience does not trust university
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers and being aware of that and
respecting that respecting boundaries one
[SPEAKER_01]: of our challenges really is the lack of
feedback from home cooks so we are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get this vegetable out to the community
but we have really had a challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: actually talking with the people cooking
these the actual final end user so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things we hope to improve in
the future and lastly making selections on
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor this is a picture of me trying
bitter ball so bitter ball is this very
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter eggplant i really do not like
bitter flavors and that's authentic it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to be realistic to embrace these
but within a greater goal of participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding we are not the ones making
selections we are not applying a western
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of flavor so a lot of some general
themes these african vegetables is
[SPEAKER_01]: bitterness they like it to be bitter they
want it to be more bitter as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: texture the slimy mucilaginous aspect
wherein an american would cook okra we
[SPEAKER_01]: would hide that we had bred that a lot of
our communities would make a soup out of
[SPEAKER_01]: okra to enhance that slimy texture some of
the things that we've learned the language
[SPEAKER_01]: matters even just within what we call our
group so our working name for a while was
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable breeding for immigrant farmers
and we really changed that we recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a power dynamic when you say we
are working for so we really strongly
[SPEAKER_01]: change that we're working with communities
and now our new name is the community
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding team and i should say this
is an outreach arm of the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: center under the guidance of Rex Bernardo
even just some of our language around the
[SPEAKER_01]: word immigrants so we are working with
people that are second generation third
[SPEAKER_01]: generation from immigrants we are working
with people that might be on refugee
[SPEAKER_01]: status and so some of our language would
be moving more towards the african
[SPEAKER_01]: diaspora instead of using the word
immigrants respect boundaries very
[SPEAKER_01]: important and challenging at the same time
to learn about that and to maybe try and
[SPEAKER_01]: heal some of these perceptions about the
university of minnesota another thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: we learned don't take things at face value
so some of the scientific publications out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that you would read would say this
species is for vegetable consumption this
[SPEAKER_01]: is for biofuel for fiber well when
actually talking with the community it
[SPEAKER_01]: turns out some of the published articles
are wrong or flip-flopped so really
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighting the importance of that oral
knowledge listening to the community
[SPEAKER_01]: learning from and learning with so with
that mutual learning we are learning so
[SPEAKER_01]: much more so much about these vegetables
we are not painting to be experts we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to share some of our knowledge and
plant science while still learning at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time and i really want to highlight
how rewarding that has been so i work in
[SPEAKER_01]: the swimming breeding lab this research
just volunteer work has really changed my
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective and just how we interact with
stakeholders and the diverse stakeholders
[SPEAKER_01]: and meeting different needs and sometimes
stakeholders have contrasting energy types
[SPEAKER_01]: and how we can bring this knowledge to our
research to my research and so what's next
[SPEAKER_01]: so we are really highlighting this year
reaching out to home cooks sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: quantifying that flavor and texture these
vegetables within our available diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions we hope to release a variety
near future so we have one for jute mallow
[SPEAKER_01]: so over four years we have been selecting
for early and earlier flowering and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen a gradual increase in flowering
time and so we believe that is ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: release the seeds but one of the main
aspects here is that we are not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: monetize this we're going to freely
release this there might be a small cost
[SPEAKER_01]: for the production of seed and that's
where we're partnering with north circle
[SPEAKER_01]: seed for that but we're really viewing
ourselves not to monetize off of this work
[SPEAKER_01]: our outreach so we are developing more
ways to quantify this information some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these communities have expressed to us a
real challenge in conveying their
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge to the next generation to their
children and so we're helping write down
[SPEAKER_01]: this knowledge make handouts that are able
to be given to the interested people as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as education so we work really
closely with the master gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: community and they were required to have
continuing education credits every year
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we act as a qualified provider of
those credits as well as increasing our
[SPEAKER_01]: community engagement just two weeks ago i
was at our local natural history museum
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about our work talking about the
community and talking with just other
[SPEAKER_01]: non-target community members that are
really interested in what we're doing so
[SPEAKER_01]: we invited them to our field day to come
and taste these vegetables to see them
[SPEAKER_01]: with your own eyes to feel them with your
own hands and lastly we're really for
[SPEAKER_01]: outsourcing working with a third party of
north circle seeds actually be the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier and so within this i'm going to
acknowledge our group all this work is
[SPEAKER_01]: done at the st paul research farm there's
a lot of helps thanks to andy and jason
[SPEAKER_01]: this is on student organic farm a lot of
our students here have no experience
[SPEAKER_01]: working on organic farm and so we really
relied upon their knowledge of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: practices so big thanks to tory doll as
well as within the hennepin county master
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners they provide probably half the
labor force required for this field it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a large amount of work on the right here
you can see we lay drip tape landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric most of the things that we do are
transplanted and it is important to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge that this took place on the
university of minnesota land which is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional homelands of dakota people
and lastly for funding we received some
[SPEAKER_01]: more funding from our college of ag which
is c fans and the plant breeding center
[SPEAKER_01]: and so with that i thank you and open time
for questions yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a great question so most of this
has been active learning we sit down as a
[SPEAKER_01]: group we learn together and in some ways
we make mistakes so a lot of our early
[SPEAKER_01]: work particularly related to language we
have learned okay this is not an ideal way
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that is an excellent concept and
really a major challenge on us so we are
[SPEAKER_01]: student volunteers our average volunteer
length would be two two and a half years i
[SPEAKER_01]: am part of the second cohort i am
transitioning off at the end of this month
[SPEAKER_01]: actually and so one of the ways we do that
is we have an onboarding and offboarding
[SPEAKER_01]: documentation but even then there are some
limitations to that so within our group we
[SPEAKER_01]: have assigned positions and before one
person off boards you need to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement and so we're working with that
but we see that maybe a long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: technician would be incredibly beneficial
to for it provides some continuity across
[SPEAKER_01]: time yeah and so rex is there but rex is a
very hands-off advisor and so if anyone is
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in collaborating writing
grants to fund technicians we'd be really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in that yeah that's a great
question i was not there during the start
[SPEAKER_01]: of this i'm not sure how much i can
provide i know that rex was really the
[SPEAKER_01]: driving force behind this he saw the need
through the article and through that
[SPEAKER_01]: really devoted a large amount of funding
from the plant breeding center to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with this to more ask your question about
how do we connect with the community in a
[SPEAKER_01]: respectful way it's just really slow word
of mouth being authentic to yourself going
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and really teaching people okay
it's really important to respect
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries it is challenging sometimes to
hear that a subset of people do not value
[SPEAKER_01]: work protest your work and being
respectful is part of that learning
[SPEAKER_01]: process it's really provided a great
amount of experiences to us at the
[SPEAKER_01]: university of minnesota
[SPEAKER_02]: uh yeah and support recognize that because
cornell took the most land yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a great question is a big challenge
um within that open sea source initiative
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a very weak verbal agreement just
that okay if you receive seed you will not
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a product you will not
commercialize this symposium um but it has
[SPEAKER_01]: been challenged working with some of these
uh even just at the world vegetable center
[SPEAKER_01]: there is an mta with associated with that
there is an exception for community
[SPEAKER_01]: members but if you're not a community
member it is our responsibility to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you seed to pass on that mta and so just
that fact of passing on mta can sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: be very prohibited um it's a challenge
that we are working with um this yesterday
[SPEAKER_01]: i was talking with maybe acquiring some
cassava cuttings and well there's mta
[SPEAKER_01]: process there requires going through our
lawyers that's a six month process and
[SPEAKER_01]: being aware of that that's a great
question and if you have any advice i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely open because it is a challenge
and so rex really advises our students
[SPEAKER_01]: okay make sure your research comes first
um but with this this work that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it's so fun it's so easy to just oh
i worked five hours on this um it's a work
[SPEAKER_01]: in progress it's important to juggle that
to respect that and i guess maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately relying upon our team we have a
team of 12 to 15 people and it's important
[SPEAKER_01]: to delegate those activities to trust them
in doing the work and just work
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboratively yeah that's a great
question so within our field day two years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago we had the idea of doing surveys we
printed out surveys we handed them out one
[SPEAKER_01]: of 80 people filled out a survey and so
one of the best ways to connect with our
[SPEAKER_01]: community really is verbally and so with
on our large team we delegate people okay
[SPEAKER_01]: go out and talk to attendees and remember
what they said and write down afterwards
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be more efficient ways to do
that but that is where we're at now that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a great question it is a big challenge of
us we recognize that we try and say okay
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids are more productive there is a
benefit of that but also maybe change our
[SPEAKER_01]: viewpoint to see where they come from they
really want to save these seeds year after
[SPEAKER_01]: year in a hybrid setting that would not be
possible within hybrid seed there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater upfront cost to some of these
which might be prohibited to certain
[SPEAKER_01]: community members and so we in this mutual
learning we're conveying that um also
[SPEAKER_01]: learning from them their preferences and
respecting them and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: taking a 15 minute coffee break please be
back here at 10 50 for our next speaker
[SPEAKER_11]: thank you all so much welcome back
everyone hope you enjoyed uh some
[SPEAKER_11]: refreshments and some coffee uh i'm really
honored to introduce one of our own solva
[SPEAKER_11]: kansen here solvig is part of uh dr jenny
moore's lab where she leads the national
[SPEAKER_11]: cover crop breeding network solvig got her
phd from the university of wisconsin and
[SPEAKER_11]: completed a postdoc at the university of
british columbia she also uh and in her
[SPEAKER_11]: past co-owned and operated a vegetable
farm up in iowa and so solvig is well
[SPEAKER_11]: versed in genetics genomics uh production
agriculture and respiratory research and
[SPEAKER_11]: she is here to present us her talk toward
40 million cover crop acres breeding fall
[SPEAKER_11]: sown cover crops for ecosystem services
and farm system compatibility let's
[SPEAKER_14]: welcome solvig thank you for having me
here today i'm excited to represent the uh
[SPEAKER_14]: cover crop breeding network and to add our
stories to this conversation about
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding for novel and complex systems
i've titled this talk to evoke a big
[SPEAKER_14]: vision which is the same way that the
cover crop breeding network began its work
[SPEAKER_14]: back in 2015 so i'm going to start by
unpacking that vision why cover crops why
[SPEAKER_14]: 40 million acres uh and why toward as in
why aren't we there yet then i'll talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about the uh role of of breeding and cover
crop adoption what makes cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: systems novel and unique and therefore apt
to talk about today i'll discuss our
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding pipeline and then some crop
specific breeding goals so soft seed in
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch uh cold tolerance in winter pea and
allelopathy in rye and then i'll talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about some frontiers that we hope will
include many million more cover cropped
[SPEAKER_14]: acres so first why cover crops cover crops
offer many benefits that become obvious
[SPEAKER_14]: when you look at pictures like this so on
the left there's a soybean field that has
[SPEAKER_14]: had some early season erosion and then a
cover cropped soybean field that is held
[SPEAKER_14]: in soil on the right you see some soil
from a concord grape orchard in western
[SPEAKER_14]: new york and you can see the difference in
soil structure after 10 years of cover
[SPEAKER_14]: cropping among about 550 farmers who
responded to the latest 2022-23 national
[SPEAKER_14]: cover crop survey uh the people cited many
reasons for using cover crops but most of
[SPEAKER_14]: them revolved around soil health so um
building soil structure increasing water
[SPEAKER_14]: infiltration reducing nitrogen leaching
other benefits include creating pollinator
[SPEAKER_14]: habitat um and weed suppression things
like that cover crops can be sown in the
[SPEAKER_14]: spring or summer to cover soil until fall
or sown to cover soil over winter or to
[SPEAKER_14]: winter kill fall sowing takes place after
cash crop harvest um so between
[SPEAKER_14]: mid-september and late october in this
area that planting window is often quite
[SPEAKER_14]: narrow and in competition with a lot of
important harvest tasks cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: establishment is generally best when it's
drilled or planted directly into the soil
[SPEAKER_14]: but sometimes it's also flown on or
interceded into standing crops to mitigate
[SPEAKER_14]: that late season time crunch also cover
crops are terminated in several ways they
[SPEAKER_14]: can be tilled they can be rolled with that
roll a roller like this big burly one or
[SPEAKER_14]: they can be sprayed down so cover crops
provide important ecosystem services so
[SPEAKER_14]: why do i specify 40 million acres the 2017
usda census of agriculture cites a little
[SPEAKER_14]: over 15 million cover crop acres in
production we are still awaiting the
[SPEAKER_14]: comparable figure from 2022 but we see
from these annual national cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: surveys a steady increase in the number of
cover crop acres per respondent cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: incentive programs are active and growing
at federal state and private or corporate
[SPEAKER_14]: levels and recent work from matt ryan's
group here at cornell showed that even
[SPEAKER_14]: after ceasing participation in these
incentive programs cover cropped acres
[SPEAKER_14]: remained about a third higher on farms
that had participated so once people see
[SPEAKER_14]: what cover cropping can do to their soil
uh they want at least some of the them
[SPEAKER_14]: want to keep doing it so why 40 million 40
million has been designated as a an
[SPEAKER_14]: ambitious but reachable goal by the
national cover crop variety development
[SPEAKER_14]: project a cap grant that we are a part of
and finally why toward why aren't we there
[SPEAKER_14]: yet so cover cropping takes time to learn
and it may not be right for every
[SPEAKER_14]: situation the issues here were top of mind
for about 150 growers who responded to the
[SPEAKER_14]: national cover cropping survey saying they
weren't using cover crops at this time and
[SPEAKER_14]: these can be legitimate concerns
especially for growers who are earlier in
[SPEAKER_14]: their cover cropping experience so some
farms do experience economic benefits say
[SPEAKER_14]: from lower fertilizer or herbicide costs
but not every farm and not every year but
[SPEAKER_14]: the items that i've starred here achieving
a good stand mitigating cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: weediness and helping with the financial
cost benefit analysis of using cover crops
[SPEAKER_14]: are things we can work on through breeding
to identify breeding goals the cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding network back in 2016-17 carried
out a survey of over 400 farmers and asked
[SPEAKER_14]: them what traits they felt were most
important for the crops we plan to work on
[SPEAKER_14]: the most frequently cited was nitrogen
fixation which we have investigated and
[SPEAKER_14]: found correlates very highly with biomass
biomass is an important goal anyway
[SPEAKER_14]: because in combination with early vigor it
helps with weed competition and all of
[SPEAKER_14]: those soil health benefits that come with
decomposition from that cover crop residue
[SPEAKER_14]: into the soil winter hardiness is a big
goal because perhaps obviously it is
[SPEAKER_14]: necessary for spring stands in places with
cold winters and finally we didn't ask on
[SPEAKER_14]: this survey about seed yield because it's
not a farmer facing trait necessarily but
[SPEAKER_14]: we know that that's important to make
cover crop seed affordable for farmers so
[SPEAKER_14]: what makes breeding cover crops novel and
complex first crop domestication usually
[SPEAKER_14]: involves elimination of seed dormancy or
hard seed seed that fails to imbibe water
[SPEAKER_14]: right after planting to emerge in the
first season crimson clover and hairy
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch two of our crops still have
substantial proportions of hard seed hairy
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch is also prone to pod dehiscence or
pod shatter which makes seed production
[SPEAKER_14]: less profitable and exacerbates that
weediness issue that's caused by the hard
[SPEAKER_14]: seed even for crops like winter pea and
cereal rye that have undergone
[SPEAKER_14]: domestication most breeding thus far has
been done for either food quality or for
[SPEAKER_14]: forage quality not for cover crop use per
se in addition the cover crop seed system
[SPEAKER_14]: is relatively less developed and less
consolidated than major cash crop seed
[SPEAKER_14]: systems so this is a figure from a ccb
network paper that talks about three tiers
[SPEAKER_14]: of cover crop seed companies so tier one
are companies that sell only to other
[SPEAKER_14]: businesses symbolized by a semi truck tier
three sell directly to farmers symbolized
[SPEAKER_14]: by a pickup truck and the tier two
companies do some of each as of 2021 over
[SPEAKER_14]: 40 companies were in tier one or two so
doing some some are all wholesale sales of
[SPEAKER_14]: cover crop seed to a variety of different
regions and and farm markets so there are
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of possible points of entry for
cover crop breeders to get varieties into
[SPEAKER_14]: the marketplace but it's really important
to know what region different seed
[SPEAKER_14]: companies target and what cropping systems
they target and last i'll mention that
[SPEAKER_14]: consumer farmer bubble down there is a
really vibrant community of practitioners
[SPEAKER_14]: and researchers i really enjoy coming from
the organic farming side that it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: combination of organic conventional
farmers and a really productive and
[SPEAKER_14]: creative exchange of ideas finally most
cover crop seed that is used right now is
[SPEAKER_14]: variety not stated or even farmer grown
and unlabeled seed the advantage to vns
[SPEAKER_14]: seed is that it's widely available and
inexpensive the disadvantage is that you
[SPEAKER_14]: don't know exactly what you're getting and
if you really like how it works you can't
[SPEAKER_14]: necessarily go back and get more of the
same for a following year so vns seed is
[SPEAKER_14]: better than nothing it's important to get
soil covered that's the first priority but
[SPEAKER_14]: as breeders our challenge is can we
improve cover crops enough that it's worth
[SPEAKER_14]: breeders or worth growers money to buy a
name variety to increase their chances of
[SPEAKER_14]: success with cover cropping we're also
interested in supporting a skilled
[SPEAKER_14]: informal seed system or seed growing
selection and trade among farmers we've in
[SPEAKER_14]: addition to a formal seed system that's
directed through seed companies we feel we
[SPEAKER_14]: need to realize that because cover crops
offer a long-term ecological benefit but
[SPEAKER_14]: not necessarily a short-term economic
benefit farmers will have different
[SPEAKER_14]: budgetary constraints depending on their
cropping system and and overall situation
[SPEAKER_14]: so we need to provide multiple avenues for
getting high quality cover crop seed into
[SPEAKER_14]: the marketplace and onto field so the
novelty the upper opportunity and the
[SPEAKER_14]: challenge of breeding for cover crop
systems are that we're working with
[SPEAKER_14]: species that have undergone this breeding
work we're working with a younger seed
[SPEAKER_14]: industry and we want to support both
formal and informal seed systems and that
[SPEAKER_14]: fact that cover crops offer short lower
short-term economic value leading to
[SPEAKER_14]: competition or coexistence with vns and
farmer farmer grown seed so in response to
[SPEAKER_14]: this challenge the cover crop breeding
network was founded back in 2015 as a
[SPEAKER_14]: collaboration among universities ars
research programs and nrcs plant material
[SPEAKER_14]: centers it has grown to include many sites
this year we have nine breeding sites four
[SPEAKER_14]: farmer breeders and 15 trial sites across
the country in this first nationwide
[SPEAKER_14]: public cover crop breeding effort the
group started by working on three of the
[SPEAKER_14]: most commonly sown winter annual legumes
winter pea hairy vetching crimson clover
[SPEAKER_14]: about two years we started working in
earnest on rye and then we added brassicas
[SPEAKER_14]: this year focusing on winter canola so
each of these crops has a leader who is
[SPEAKER_14]: responsible for breeding pipeline design
and centralized analysis of data from
[SPEAKER_14]: these various trials and nurseries and
notably Cornell serves as the hub for the
[SPEAKER_14]: cover crop breeding network my boss Jenny
Moore is the national program director for
[SPEAKER_14]: the cover crop breeding network and as
coordinator I get to work for with over 50
[SPEAKER_14]: technicians researchers students farmer
collaborators across the country to make
[SPEAKER_14]: this thing run and to note I get to be the
one talking up here today but the stories
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling wouldn't be the same stories
without contributions from all these
[SPEAKER_14]: people so as I've mentioned in all our
crafts we're breeding for biomass vigor
[SPEAKER_14]: and winter survival we also have some crop
specific goals I'll talk specifically
[SPEAKER_14]: about soft seed and vetch cold tolerance
and freeze-thaw tolerance in winter pea
[SPEAKER_14]: and both allelopathy and cold tolerance in
rye this is our you'll notice the question
[SPEAKER_14]: mark under the brassicas this is our very
first year looking at brassicas so in
[SPEAKER_14]: collaboration with Mike Stan the Kansas
State University who just supplied some
[SPEAKER_14]: germplasm from his program that he feels
could have promised for cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: applications so we're looking at it and
once we see what's there we'll figure out
[SPEAKER_14]: where we need to go with the breeding
program for the legumes and rye our
[SPEAKER_14]: pipeline starts with breeding nurseries
like these where we note and select single
[SPEAKER_14]: plants for the legumes which we've been
working on for the longest time the next
[SPEAKER_14]: step is advanced line trials so these are
15-foot plots flanked by triticale to
[SPEAKER_14]: simulate that competition with a small
grain in a mix which is how they're
[SPEAKER_14]: commonly sown we take vigor ratings in
fall and spring percent stand in fall and
[SPEAKER_14]: spring to gauge winter survival and then
biomass harvest in a reasonably
[SPEAKER_14]: appropriate time for each site the best
advanced line trials go into mixed legume
[SPEAKER_14]: triticale plots to more accurately reflect
the way they would be used in the field
[SPEAKER_14]: and then concurrently with with both
levels of advanced line trials we run seed
[SPEAKER_14]: yield trials so that we can either cull
lines with low seed yield despite good
[SPEAKER_14]: field performance or identify lines with
exceptional seed yield to advance them in
[SPEAKER_14]: the process or use them as parents then
putting it all together to breed for cover
[SPEAKER_14]: crop performance we start with germplasm
sourcing and or development which I'll
[SPEAKER_14]: describe in some of these crop specific
stories we selected in nurseries and then
[SPEAKER_14]: choose the best lines for advanced line
trialing the trial plots scale up as the
[SPEAKER_14]: lines do increasingly well over years of
testing concurrently we run these seed
[SPEAKER_14]: yield trials first in one location
Corvallis Oregon is a major seed producing
[SPEAKER_14]: region so it's kind of an ideal seed
production environment for many crops and
[SPEAKER_14]: then we expand to more environments to try
to identify additional seed production
[SPEAKER_14]: regions as as lines advance and then
finally as we get to commercialization
[SPEAKER_14]: some stories as in the next story I'm
about to tell we're satisfied with data
[SPEAKER_14]: from our multi-site trials and wanted to
move directly to release some want to test
[SPEAKER_14]: material in their own trials so those are
the those are the general roots that get
[SPEAKER_14]: to commercial availability so we will
start with hairy vetch vetch is the best
[SPEAKER_14]: overwinter annual legume for both winter
survival and nitrogen fixation but it has
[SPEAKER_14]: a reputation as some of you might know it
can get massive and viney which is great
[SPEAKER_14]: if you have the equipment and the timing
to kill it when it needs to be killed it
[SPEAKER_14]: is less great if you don't have either of
those things and it has that fraction of
[SPEAKER_14]: hard seed that and is prone to pod shatter
which allows vetch to become a weed in
[SPEAKER_14]: certain cropping systems that is an insect
pollinated out crossing highly
[SPEAKER_14]: heterozygous species such that the
varieties I talk about or even the lines
[SPEAKER_14]: are open pollinated the CCD vetch breeding
program has been led by Lisa Kissinkusik
[SPEAKER_14]: and Heathcliff Ryde at the ARS dairy
forest research unit in Wisconsin they
[SPEAKER_14]: started with vetch at six nurseries in
2016 they did had a wide germplasm search
[SPEAKER_14]: pulling in germplasm from Russia,
Ukraine, Serbia, China, Iran, France
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding populations from the upper
Midwest a couple of VNS varieties from
[SPEAKER_14]: seed companies even a farmer maintained
landrace from North Dakota their goal was
[SPEAKER_14]: to find the most genetic diversity
possible in the hope that these variation
[SPEAKER_14]: for these traits they cared about winter
hardiness biomass vigor early flowering
[SPEAKER_14]: would be in there nurseries are planted
replicated and space planted in multiple
[SPEAKER_14]: locations using the vigor and winter
survival data provided by each location
[SPEAKER_14]: Lisa selects among families and within
families for the best plants seed is
[SPEAKER_14]: harvested from every plant and then a
balanced bulk of seed is made from all the
[SPEAKER_14]: harvested plants to comprise the line that
is then entered into advanced line trials
[SPEAKER_14]: so this is a fairly traditional forage
breeding process but it has been
[SPEAKER_14]: successful in achieving a couple of
upcoming releases this is the first one
[SPEAKER_14]: this will be available through Mountain
View seeds which is a wholesale or tier
[SPEAKER_14]: one distributor starting in 2025 if all
things go well this population was
[SPEAKER_14]: selected in our 2017 early maturing vetch
nursery in North Carolina the table here
[SPEAKER_14]: is composed of data from about 50 years or
50 site years of advanced line trials and
[SPEAKER_14]: all of the numbers are represented as a
percentage of the best check which is AU
[SPEAKER_14]: merit so you'll see that biomass winter
survival and early flowering are
[SPEAKER_14]: comparable to the best check but what
really stands out is a higher seed yield
[SPEAKER_14]: and much higher adaptation so CCB nitrous
is predicted to be in the top three in
[SPEAKER_14]: biomass for three times more environments
than AU merit so this is this is the power
[SPEAKER_14]: of this broad testing network that hasn't
been available before for cover crops to
[SPEAKER_14]: detect varieties that are broadly adapted
at least for biomass which is the trait
[SPEAKER_14]: we're talking about and then get them out
there to seed companies our next release
[SPEAKER_14]: that's upcoming is with Albert Lee seed
which is a tier two seed company so
[SPEAKER_14]: selling wholesale and also directly to
farmers it focuses on the upper Midwest
[SPEAKER_14]: and Northeast so we at seed companies
request we do separate analyses focusing
[SPEAKER_14]: on various regions so that we can give
them results most relevant to their
[SPEAKER_14]: consumers this line was actually selected
here at Cornell in 2018 and it's very well
[SPEAKER_14]: adapted for winter survival and biomass in
in this sales area in addition the seed
[SPEAKER_14]: yield is about 20% better than AU merit so
you can see that seed yield is something
[SPEAKER_14]: that seed companies are gravitating toward
not mysteriously our multi-environment
[SPEAKER_14]: trials have also lent some insights
regarding trait relationships in hairy
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch so after analyzing data from about
50 site year environments we found high
[SPEAKER_14]: and very significant correlations between
several of our most important traits so
[SPEAKER_14]: fall bigger spring bigger biomass we also
found that biomass correlates moderately
[SPEAKER_14]: with winter survival and all of this is
great because we don't have to make big
[SPEAKER_14]: trade-offs between these important traits
the only trade-off we found is in yellow
[SPEAKER_14]: there so that's winter survival and early
vigor so we could face a challenge
[SPEAKER_14]: selecting for both early flowering and
winter survival Lisa who led this research
[SPEAKER_14]: also analyzed environmental genetic and G
by E components of each trait and you'll
[SPEAKER_14]: notice that the blue bar which is the
environmental portion is vastly larger
[SPEAKER_14]: than the pink and orange portions which
are the genetic and G by E effects but she
[SPEAKER_14]: then overlaid or associated weather and
soil factors and found salient drivers of
[SPEAKER_14]: various components for various traits so
for example the environmental component of
[SPEAKER_14]: freezing degree of winter survival is
driven by freezing degree days without
[SPEAKER_14]: snow cover doesn't really a surprise to
any of us who have worked with
[SPEAKER_14]: overwintering crops snow protects crops so
if you have snow cover it can get really
[SPEAKER_14]: cold and more crops will emerge undamaged
but when you have those really cold
[SPEAKER_14]: temperatures without snow protection
that's when a lot of crops struggle we
[SPEAKER_14]: also saw that the G by E component of
biomass was related to sand content so
[SPEAKER_14]: lines having variable performance some
doing very well in sandy soils some doing
[SPEAKER_14]: very poorly and vice versa so these
insights this analysis is done we're doing
[SPEAKER_14]: similar ones for winter pea and crimson
clover these help us better define our
[SPEAKER_14]: trialing environments and our breeding
environments so that we can identify
[SPEAKER_14]: whether we call the mega environments or
environmental groups that are relevant to
[SPEAKER_14]: breed together to you know constrain
genetic variation in strategic ways
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of trying to breed for the whole
environment for traits where G by E is
[SPEAKER_14]: highly influential in addition thanks to
more work from the USDA Dairy Forage
[SPEAKER_14]: Research Center in Wisconsin we can
leverage a new reference genome for hairy
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch.
[SPEAKER_14]: hairy vetch is in the visea genus of the
favaceae family favaceae also includes
[SPEAKER_14]: peas and beans and many more species
genuses the first chromosome level visea
[SPEAKER_14]: genus was for common vetch or visea sativa
that was published just in 2022 but that
[SPEAKER_14]: species is self pollinating and highly
homozygous the vetch genome was assembled
[SPEAKER_14]: just this past year in 2023 from long read
sequences and is just published it used a
[SPEAKER_14]: clonally propagated individual of AU merit
which we remember was the best check from
[SPEAKER_14]: our field trials it showed about 30 times
35 times more heterozygosity than the
[SPEAKER_14]: common vetch genome and worked much better
for alignment of long read sequences from
[SPEAKER_14]: hairy vetch so using that resource Neil
Toulou who's a research associate with
[SPEAKER_14]: Drs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Reidy and Kissin Cusick started work to
get at the weediness of vetch so hard seed
[SPEAKER_14]: and pod shatter in other legume crops both
of those traits have been found to
[SPEAKER_14]: associate with one or a few large effect
loci which then lend themselves to marker
[SPEAKER_14]: assisted selection so they thought let's
see if we can find that in hairy vetch
[SPEAKER_14]: they genotyped about a thousand vetch
plants from 80 common maternal parents
[SPEAKER_14]: grew those seed grew those plants in two
environments and they found a 68%
[SPEAKER_14]: reliability related to heritability for
seed dormancy which again is great news to
[SPEAKER_14]: breeders you can potentially do something
about hard seed percentage in vetch Neil
[SPEAKER_14]: found a large effect loci on chromosome 1
and is proceeding to or they they have
[SPEAKER_14]: developed a high throughput PCR
phenotyping system to genotype you know
[SPEAKER_14]: young germplasm our first soft seed
nurseries generated with this system will
[SPEAKER_14]: go in this fall which is really exciting a
manual hard seed test takes about 30
[SPEAKER_14]: minutes per sample so this is a huge
improvement and being able to detect
[SPEAKER_14]: germplasm that could be favorable for for
soft seed we found that either one or two
[SPEAKER_14]: copies of this gene is effective but no
QTL were found for pod shatter so the next
[SPEAKER_14]: step was to look at different vetch
germplasm pools and hope to both validate
[SPEAKER_14]: that QTL and maybe find some some QTL that
were present with lower allele frequency
[SPEAKER_14]: for pod shatter so they used pooled
phenotypically contrasting DNA samples
[SPEAKER_14]: from four site years not used in that
previous study and they did find six QTL
[SPEAKER_14]: for pod dehiscence no four four QTL for
pod dehiscence unfortunately they worked
[SPEAKER_14]: in the wrong direction so they made pods
more prone to shatter instead of less but
[SPEAKER_14]: as Neil said turns out science is hard
they also found they also found six QTL
[SPEAKER_14]: for seed dormancy which they'll continue
to explore but notably you don't see that
[SPEAKER_14]: you'd see no peaks on chromosome 1 so as
we know these association studies are
[SPEAKER_14]: dependent on the germplasm used the
environments they're grown in maybe even
[SPEAKER_14]: sequencing techniques or sequencing runs
what Neil and Keith Cliff and Lisa are
[SPEAKER_14]: discovering though that is not published
yet they they think that the major marker
[SPEAKER_14]: that they found before is associated with
a haplotype that was present in either
[SPEAKER_14]: very low frequency or not at all in these
populations and that it still is important
[SPEAKER_14]: for soft seed the closest marker that with
fairly high significance in this study did
[SPEAKER_14]: show that it was being selected down over
years in our breeding program through
[SPEAKER_14]: those manual slow tests so hopefully we
have honed in on an important region
[SPEAKER_14]: although we certainly haven't told the
whole story with that one large effect
[SPEAKER_14]: locus and finally a bonus of starting to
investigate the hairy vetch genome was
[SPEAKER_14]: discovering this out group PCA revealed
that there were two major subpopulations
[SPEAKER_14]: in our breeding program the germplasm in
this out group is derived from just a few
[SPEAKER_14]: parents including purple bounty which is a
widely sown vetch cultivar that and that
[SPEAKER_14]: we well that has been called hairy vetch
but these individuals are pretty distantly
[SPEAKER_14]: related to the vizia villosa or hairy
vetch genome and they also appear not to
[SPEAKER_14]: cross pollinate with this core population
we consulted a legume expert at the
[SPEAKER_14]: University of Miami Ohio herbarium and he
gave us a few possible species that this
[SPEAKER_14]: could belong to but didn't make a
definitive ID we're calling it smooth
[SPEAKER_14]: vetch just because it's smooth it has much
less pubescence it's generally more
[SPEAKER_14]: determinate earlier to flower so it has
some beneficial traits but not hairy vetch
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's not crossing with our hairy vetch
so we're taking it out of our breeding
[SPEAKER_14]: populations we feel like this is a great
example of what happens when you start to
[SPEAKER_14]: leverage genomic tools for these species
that just haven't received much attention
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot we can discover that has
just not been on our radar before okay
[SPEAKER_14]: shifting gears to a self-pollinated legume
winter pea winter peas are not quite as
[SPEAKER_14]: winter hardy as winter vetch parentheses
yet but they do make a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_14]: contribution and they're reliably soft
seeded so there's no weediness issue with
[SPEAKER_14]: pea thus far the CCB pea breeding program
has worked primarily with Rebecca McGee
[SPEAKER_14]: who's the USDA dry pulse breeder out in
Pullman Washington and she's provided
[SPEAKER_14]: crosses that show promise or that she
feels are promising for the traits we care
[SPEAKER_14]: about the CCB breeding program most of the
work I'll be talking about has been led by
[SPEAKER_14]: Elise Bastos-Martins now of Corteva when
she was a grad student at NCSU and then
[SPEAKER_14]: it's recently been handed over to me so
these segregated crosses that we've
[SPEAKER_14]: received from Rebecca are planted in both
research nurseries and on-farm nurseries
[SPEAKER_14]: in some cases winter does all of the
selection we just keep everything that
[SPEAKER_14]: survives when we don't have much winter
kill we select on those important traits
[SPEAKER_14]: bigger biomass again we make selections
among them within families the best lines
[SPEAKER_14]: are increased and advanced to our advanced
line trials our advanced line testing
[SPEAKER_14]: network has allowed us to identify regions
where pea survival is low but not zero and
[SPEAKER_14]: then to strategically use those areas for
selection so that green circle up there is
[SPEAKER_14]: where winter survival is less than 50% but
not zero so that's where we're coming
[SPEAKER_14]: concentrating our on-farm nurseries so we
can leverage both those cold environments
[SPEAKER_14]: and those farmers many of whom are farmer
breeders for their their eye their
[SPEAKER_14]: experienced eye and a couple of selections
that I'll talk about in a moment came from
[SPEAKER_14]: those on-farm nurseries so the best
performing lines we have so far are those
[SPEAKER_14]: from the participatory breeding program so
this analysis was also done for Albert Lee
[SPEAKER_14]: seeds so it involves it includes sites in
the Midwest and Northeast why a winter is
[SPEAKER_14]: was the best best name check overall so
that's set at a hundred percent and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything else is compared to why a
winter you'll see this trade-off can I
[SPEAKER_14]: figure out how to use this yeah there we
go so between lower fall bigger and then
[SPEAKER_14]: higher winter survival biomass spring
bigger that's at the common trade-off in
[SPEAKER_14]: plants right so plants keep their growth
small before the cold season which allows
[SPEAKER_14]: them to concentrate metabolites and do all
those winter hardiness things and then
[SPEAKER_14]: they really grow the next year but we're
not seeing that trade-off in these top two
[SPEAKER_14]: lines so they're showing really nice fall
vigor and they're still surviving the
[SPEAKER_14]: winter showing good spring vigor and
putting a nice biomass in the spring so
[SPEAKER_14]: that's exciting the first one is being
picked up by Albert Lee seeds the second
[SPEAKER_14]: one is since it's a farmer bred line and
this farmer runs a small seed company he's
[SPEAKER_14]: going to be the primary licensee on the
PvP and he'll either do all the seed
[SPEAKER_14]: distribution himself or maybe sub license
to another seed company so this is one of
[SPEAKER_14]: the ways that we're trying to place
improved germplasm at multiple points in
[SPEAKER_14]: in the seed system our network allows
trailing in many environments but there
[SPEAKER_14]: are only a few of our locations that are
cold enough to really test winter survival
[SPEAKER_14]: so to increase our insights into winter
survival of these peas and to introduce
[SPEAKER_14]: farmers to our lines and the idea of
growing peas as an over winter cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: in general we're planning small-scale
on-farm trials with about 60 growers this
[SPEAKER_14]: fall we're going to use seed linked
trailing software which is a participatory
[SPEAKER_14]: uh participatory variety testing software
and we'll supply each grower with three or
[SPEAKER_14]: four lines a mix of commercial lines and
ccb developed lines these will be small
[SPEAKER_14]: plots like about the size of those
advanced line trials so a good fit for
[SPEAKER_14]: vegetable growers even gardeners with
substantial plots people with single row
[SPEAKER_14]: planters or the patients to plant by hand
or who we're looking for and we're excited
[SPEAKER_14]: to both expand our network of growers
especially to that smaller grower crowd
[SPEAKER_14]: many of the growers that we've been
working with with cover cropping you know
[SPEAKER_14]: to get to 40 million acres you need people
who are operating a lot of acres but cover
[SPEAKER_14]: crops have a really important place in
smaller scale farming as well and this is
[SPEAKER_14]: one of the ways that we can start making
those connections and learning whether
[SPEAKER_14]: smaller farmers have different needs than
larger farmers do we need to be breeding
[SPEAKER_14]: for different objectives or is it more an
education and extension game about getting
[SPEAKER_14]: people familiar with these practices and
finally we are seeking new germplasm
[SPEAKER_14]: that's better adapted for both low
temperatures and freeze thaw or
[SPEAKER_14]: acclimation and deacclimation to cold
steve mulkey from the university of
[SPEAKER_14]: minnesota has led the work on this front
using growth chambers to screen for
[SPEAKER_14]: freezing tolerance he subjects these force
p seedlings to a cycle of cold then sub
[SPEAKER_14]: zero acclimation then uh freeze down to uh
negative 12 celsius and then a recovery
[SPEAKER_14]: and scores uh damage on a scale of zero to
five from no damage to complete death he
[SPEAKER_14]: started a breeding program with the most
freeze tolerant accessions and ran field
[SPEAKER_14]: tests through minnesota winters and found
a pretty impressive range of variation
[SPEAKER_14]: from uh zero survival to almost 100
percent he selected the lines with more
[SPEAKER_14]: than 60 survival um then selected further
on seed code characteristics and so these
[SPEAKER_14]: f34 lines here are currently currently
planted in his nursery at minnesota this
[SPEAKER_14]: was corresponding by email with him and he
said that about five percent of them are
[SPEAKER_14]: surviving they had they had a very low
snow winter which is and and very cold so
[SPEAKER_14]: these are great selection conditions um
then we have some of the more promising f2
[SPEAKER_14]: derived f3 families in our nursery here
and on those on-farm nurseries in cold
[SPEAKER_14]: zones so we'll see what happens finally i
was really impressed with this figure
[SPEAKER_14]: which compares these f3 families with the
f3 derived f4 families so these are
[SPEAKER_14]: parents and progeny in the f3s we're
seeing very few individuals per family
[SPEAKER_14]: zero to maybe a few with no damage after
this freezing protocol in the next
[SPEAKER_14]: generation we're seeing um you know up to
a third of individuals within families
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing no damage after uh the freeze thaw
protocol and many more with intermediate
[SPEAKER_14]: scores you can see the the numeric scores
remembering that low scores are better in
[SPEAKER_14]: this case um so this is really exciting
progress and we're excited to keep working
[SPEAKER_14]: toward this especially as freeze thaw
becomes more uh prevalent across more
[SPEAKER_14]: locations we're seeing it we saw it in
corvallis oregon this year the mid
[SPEAKER_14]: atlanting is seeing it more as weather
becomes more volatile this will be a more
[SPEAKER_14]: important trait um for us to consider and
last but definitely not least is um cereal
[SPEAKER_14]: rye which is the most widely grown cover
crop for its ability to tolerate late
[SPEAKER_14]: sowing when nothing else will grow in the
fall cereal rye will probably grow it's
[SPEAKER_14]: cold hardiness and it's abundant biomass
production in the spring the ccb rye
[SPEAKER_14]: breeding program began in earnest last
season with the dual goals of breeding
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically for cover crop use especially
for northern locations and also to
[SPEAKER_14]: leverage our north carolina state's team
ongoing work on a wheel of pathy and rye
[SPEAKER_14]: at cornell and at the university of
minnesota we started evaluating pi lines
[SPEAKER_14]: that showed promise for cold locations um
at nc state they started work many years
[SPEAKER_14]: ago to identify uh rye lines with high
allelopathy so this rye allelopathy rye
[SPEAKER_14]: contains compounds benzozaxonoids that
inhibit the germination and growth of
[SPEAKER_14]: small seeds they occur in both roots and
shoots uh chrisry brook horton started
[SPEAKER_14]: work about 20 years ago to identify for uh
genotype specificity of these compounds
[SPEAKER_14]: and then demak rebong and alia waris are
have been working with uh protocols for um
[SPEAKER_14]: well the goal of characterizing
allelopathy and rye was to hopefully
[SPEAKER_14]: develop a high allelopathy rye that could
be used strategically for weed suppression
[SPEAKER_14]: and as a former vegetable grower who
wanted small seeds to grow after my rye
[SPEAKER_14]: cover crop i know there's a place for a
low allelopathy rye as well so the nc
[SPEAKER_14]: state team developed an in vitro assay to
gauge the effect of rye on an indicator
[SPEAKER_14]: crop and also a field assay using lettuce
which is small seeded vulnerable to
[SPEAKER_14]: allelopathy damage and grows well in north
carolina springs which is when rye goes to
[SPEAKER_14]: boot or to starting to go to head uh you
will notice that the allelopathy from
[SPEAKER_14]: these rye plants can either form a
gradient like so or a ring um dramatically
[SPEAKER_14]: termed a halo of death so once we identify
lines with either high or low allelopathy
[SPEAKER_14]: so the lines in yellow here um have high
allelopathy or a high level of uh weed
[SPEAKER_14]: control or surrogate weed control and then
a few lines with low weed control in blue
[SPEAKER_14]: the next step is to integrate that into
elite germplasm so the nc state team has
[SPEAKER_14]: three advanced lines that will start
nationwide testing this fall they also
[SPEAKER_14]: made crosses between these high
allelopathy lines and two winter hardy
[SPEAKER_14]: varieties um these are hot by northern
crosses that will feed into a couple of
[SPEAKER_14]: other experiments so these will um this is
a cornell based program to select rye for
[SPEAKER_14]: improved cold soil germination and vigor
with the goal of developing varieties will
[SPEAKER_14]: perform better in those late season type
planting windows um after cash crop
[SPEAKER_14]: harvest in the northern region phd student
raksha tapa is planting these lines both
[SPEAKER_14]: in northern new york and in this thermal
gradient table um so she can select
[SPEAKER_14]: individuals that emerge just above
freezing and finally the hot by northern
[SPEAKER_14]: crosses um are planted in our nursery here
at new york and also in minnesota in
[SPEAKER_14]: addition to the selections we made last
year we will make our selections this year
[SPEAKER_14]: harvest the seed send some to north
carolina so they can do allelopathy
[SPEAKER_14]: testing which will then inform our
selections from nurseries next year so we
[SPEAKER_14]: can start diverging our group into a high
allelopathy and low allelopathy group um
[SPEAKER_14]: and an exciting recent development in our
rye program is at least a kissing husik
[SPEAKER_14]: who's a cornell grad um and one of the
powerhouses behind the ccb vet program is
[SPEAKER_14]: starting a new position as a cover crop
forage breeder focusing on rye still in
[SPEAKER_14]: wisconsin she'll be taking the lead on the
ccb the ccb's rye breeding program and
[SPEAKER_14]: starting with identifying rye ideotypes
that will serve different uh production
[SPEAKER_14]: systems so what combination of early and
late maturity high and low allelopathy
[SPEAKER_14]: plant stature etc will serve um cropping
systems in different regions of the
[SPEAKER_14]: country and different crops okay so cover
crop breeding progress we have new variety
[SPEAKER_14]: releases coming in vetch and pea we have a
marker for a soft seed we are breeding rye
[SPEAKER_14]: toward high and low allelopathy we're
working on cold soil emergence and vigor
[SPEAKER_14]: in both pea well work on that in rye and
cold tolerance in pea frontiers looking
[SPEAKER_14]: like fleshing out the back half of our
breeding pipeline so the steps around
[SPEAKER_14]: increase commercialization farmer adoption
uh we are working on expanding seed
[SPEAKER_14]: production regions and continuing to grow
our connections with seed companies to add
[SPEAKER_14]: that logistical and financial
sustainability to cover crop seed systems
[SPEAKER_14]: uh remote phenotyping will be really
helpful to build rich meaningful and less
[SPEAKER_14]: labor-intensive data sets uh we can breed
more specifically for intercropping we can
[SPEAKER_14]: look at employing genomic selection
strategically in ways that it makes sense
[SPEAKER_14]: as genomic tools come along for the crops
we are working on so the path to 40
[SPEAKER_14]: million acres is paved with or perhaps
sown with uh continued education
[SPEAKER_14]: networking and creativity among growers
and researchers uh the relationship that
[SPEAKER_14]: facilitates all that and continues
building this cover crop seed system with
[SPEAKER_14]: diverse points of entry and broad
availability of high quality cover crops
[SPEAKER_14]: seed uh and variety improvement so
traditional unglamorous yet effective
[SPEAKER_14]: field breeding and multi-site trialing uh
genomic analysis controlled environment
[SPEAKER_14]: work for specific traits if you are
interested and curious about this we're
[SPEAKER_14]: having a couple of field walks coming up
on april 23rd and may 1st um you can snap
[SPEAKER_14]: this page or go to that qr code that's our
website on our events page um there's more
[SPEAKER_14]: information uh please come walk and talk
with us if you're interested we'd love to
[SPEAKER_14]: show you what's out there thanks to the
more lab without their hands-on work in
[SPEAKER_14]: the field and handling seed um this would
not be possible and thanks to the ccb
[SPEAKER_14]: network team um and our funders uh
grateful for the chance to talk with you
[SPEAKER_11]: all yeah this is about the work your
collaborator in minnesota was doing with
[SPEAKER_11]: the field trials for the freeze thaw
tolerance and winter pea how are they
[SPEAKER_11]: distinguishing that phenotype from just
like winter survival scores so you mean
[SPEAKER_11]: the controlled environment phenotype when
they're doing the field trials for freeze
[SPEAKER_11]: thaw now yeah how are they are they just
going at the end of the season in the
[SPEAKER_11]: spring and scoring winter survival broadly
or are they getting more data points along
[SPEAKER_14]: the yeah i i think the um the control
environment trial is to select germplasm
[SPEAKER_14]: for for intimating or to select what goes
into the field and then whatever
[SPEAKER_14]: conditions happen that season select for
whatever survives um yeah but it gets it's
[SPEAKER_14]: um you know it's hit or miss because you
know you don't know what you're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: get yeah good question
[SPEAKER_14]: that's a great question um and then you're
uh welcome to weigh in as well um i think
[SPEAKER_14]: there is a point at which too much is too
much in terms of say biomass um depending
[SPEAKER_14]: on the cropping system depending on how
they plan to turn terminate it um in terms
[SPEAKER_14]: of whether we get to good enough and then
move on yes
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah right but yeah yeah exactly i think
maybe that radiation happens with like
[SPEAKER_14]: filling more niches um and you know say
for vegetable growers which um especially
[SPEAKER_14]: like smaller scale diversified vegetable
growers like i was um there could be lions
[SPEAKER_14]: breads for for those uh planting and
termination windows um that are offered by
[SPEAKER_14]: seed companies that really target that
market that are smaller mid-size and maybe
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe very regionally adapted um that that
makes sense to me including some of these
[SPEAKER_14]: workhorse broadly adapted varieties that
are really widely available
[SPEAKER_02]: um yes exactly right right and and rye is
really an easier nut to crack because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: so widely used and it's often used in
monoculture so the testing is much less
[SPEAKER_14]: complex whereas legumes are often grown in
mixtures with various small grains um and
[SPEAKER_14]: are just less widely used um than than rye
by a long shot so it's it's both initial
[SPEAKER_14]: adoption of try this species at all and
then dialing in what traits within that
[SPEAKER_14]: species are going to optimize the system
yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_14]: i mean that sounds great um there we're
only really at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_14]: investigating this trait um so what what
we know now is allelopathy and i believe
[SPEAKER_14]: all tissues of the plant is greatest at
boot stage or when the plant starts to uh
[SPEAKER_14]: starts to make head right and and the head
emerges from from the leaf sheet um in
[SPEAKER_14]: terms of distribution between root and
shoot um in terms of you know some of the
[SPEAKER_14]: lines that have been identified as high
allelopathy some of our discussion within
[SPEAKER_14]: our group has been are these lines just
earlier you know are they just
[SPEAKER_14]: phenologically uh more advanced and that's
why they're producing more of this
[SPEAKER_14]: compound um we're also seeing we have some
preliminary results in a greenhouse screen
[SPEAKER_14]: um where they grew i think four different
rye lines with known different levels of
[SPEAKER_14]: the allelopathy um harvested the shoots
and then planted uh various species of uh
[SPEAKER_14]: crops or weeds and saw very different
effects on different crops um and
[SPEAKER_14]: sometimes like a rye line by crop
interaction so this is very complex and so
[SPEAKER_14]: um yeah we're trying to well this is one
of lisa's jobs is to figure out um how do
[SPEAKER_14]: we start to parse out these different uh
variables to figure out how we
[SPEAKER_14]: strategically use this trait um yeah it's
it's it's cool and powerful to just like
[SPEAKER_14]: blast the weeds out of the field but if
you get allelopathy that strong like there
[SPEAKER_14]: is evidence that it also affects large
seeds like corn and soybeans and like not
[SPEAKER_14]: what we want um so yeah it's an
interesting one yes
[SPEAKER_14]: not right now i know there is biological
nitrogen fixation data taken several years
[SPEAKER_14]: ago and that's how we came to that
conclusion that nitrogen fixation is so
[SPEAKER_14]: highly correlated with biomass let's
measure biomass because it's so much
[SPEAKER_14]: easier but in terms of uh release over the
plant's life cycle vis-a-vis availability
[SPEAKER_14]: to the next plant i don't believe that's
been done in like a time sequence yeah
[SPEAKER_14]: okay uh-huh right i believe that most of
them are for employing the practice so you
[SPEAKER_14]: sign up for i'm going to put cover crops
on 200 acres somebody from the soil
[SPEAKER_14]: conservation district comes out and
verifies yes you've done that you get your
[SPEAKER_14]: incentive i think some of the private
programs are starting to try to quantify
[SPEAKER_14]: change over time
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah yeah right but but that yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yes the recommendation tools yeah yep yeah
they have that and there's also some
[SPEAKER_14]: programs are designed for new adopters of
cover cropping some will incentivize
[SPEAKER_14]: people or um give them benefits for what
they're already doing um yeah it's very
[SPEAKER_14]: diverse and changes every year with
quality yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_14]: well this would be didn't use wheelhouse
because she's been at this for more years
[SPEAKER_13]: than me i just came on last year so uh
from the department of plant and
[SPEAKER_13]: agro-ecosystem uh sciences at the
university of wisconsin medicine sorry i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: very bad in pronouncing these names under
the mentorship of dr e wang and then uh
[SPEAKER_13]: she her research project focuses on uh
development of remote sensing based
[SPEAKER_13]: decision support models for nitrogen
management of vegetable crops such as dark
[SPEAKER_13]: kidney beans and snap beans and today she
will be presenting some of her work in the
[SPEAKER_13]: talk uh titled eye in the sky
hyperspectral imaging for sustainable
[SPEAKER_13]: nitrogen management in vegetables i would
like to welcome and you already have them
[SPEAKER_02]: and past research has shown that that
excessive application of nitrogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers could lead to nitrate leaching
and groundwater contamination excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: application of nitrogenous fertilizers
also leads to increased in the input cost
[SPEAKER_00]: the graph on this slide represent the
change in the prices of fertilizers over
[SPEAKER_00]: past few years and we could see that after
the year 2020 there was substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the prices of nitrogenous
fertilizers this map represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater contamination due to nitrates
in wisconsin and studies have shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 30 percent of private wells have a
nitrate level that exceeds 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: per liter excessive application of
nitrogen fertilizers also increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pressure such as white mold in
case of kidney beans and snap beans and
[SPEAKER_00]: higher disease pressure reduces the crop
yield previous study conducted on dry
[SPEAKER_00]: beans suggested that that there was higher
white mold incidence when higher nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: rates such as 179 kg per hectare was
applied as we know that every human being
[SPEAKER_00]: has slightly different fingerprints and it
is possible to identify specific human
[SPEAKER_00]: being those fingerprints belong to and we
could do similar thing with plants even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they don't have fingers well the
fingers i am talking here do not like the
[SPEAKER_00]: the fingerprints i'm talking here do not
start with fingers but with light when
[SPEAKER_00]: light fall on plants some of it is
absorbed by the plant but certain portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the light is reflected back into the
atmosphere and the hyperspectral sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: installed on airplanes or drones or
satellites capture the light reflected
[SPEAKER_00]: back by the plants and provide us with the
information that some of it we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see with the naked eye also known as
spectral signature the graph on this slide
[SPEAKER_00]: show the spectral signature of a healthy
plant shown by darker green line is
[SPEAKER_00]: different from spectral signature of a
nutritionally deficient plant crop growth
[SPEAKER_00]: is largely affected by the interaction of
genetic environment and management factors
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are using hyperspectral remote
sensing to understand the spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: variability within and across the crop
fields the overall objective of our
[SPEAKER_00]: research project is to use aerial
hyperspectral remote sensing for
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how snap beans and kidney
beans respond to nitrogen fertilization on
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigated sandy soil during the first half
of the talk i will be talking about snap
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and during the later part of the
talk i will be covering kidney beans this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the field design of snap beans where we
applied six different nitrogen treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: shown by different colored rectangles on
the rgb image and we applied nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments at three different growth
stages to two different cultivars one of
[SPEAKER_00]: which dm88 was a nodulating cultivar and
second was a non-nodulating cultivar this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a timeline of in-season nitrogen
application shown by two blue bars
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral imagery collection shown by
orange bars and whole leaf sample
[SPEAKER_00]: collection shown by two green bars the red
rectangles on this slide represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of hyperspectral images and
whole leaves that were used for in-season
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen prediction and all the
hyperspectral images were used for end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season crop yield prediction we
collected hyperspectral images using high
[SPEAKER_00]: spec sensor by installing it on airplane
and we collected images on weekly basis
[SPEAKER_00]: after extracting the reflectance values by
drawing the polygons using QGIS software
[SPEAKER_00]: we selected the top 20 wavelengths that
highly correlate with the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season crop yield and in-season nitrogen
status of the plant and we trained
[SPEAKER_00]: different machine learning models by using
top 20 wavelengths along with genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and management factors the
genetic factors were cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors were soil
temperature precipitation growing degree
[SPEAKER_00]: days and management factors were nitrogen
rate irrigation and days after planting
[SPEAKER_00]: this slide shows the crop yield of two
different cultivars of snap beans we
[SPEAKER_00]: observed that non-nodulating cultivar that
was Huntington was having significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher crop yield when nitrogen was
applied at 112 kg per hectare or higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than that however dm88 which is a
nodulating cultivar was having
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly higher crop yield at 84 kg
nitrogen per hectare that means that dm88
[SPEAKER_00]: could might be fixing nitrogen and it
needs less application of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer this graph represent the leaf
nitrogen percentage at different growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of snap bean plants we observed
that higher nitrogen rates were having
[SPEAKER_00]: higher leaf nitrogen percentage and
overall leaf nitrogen percentage decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: with increase in the growth of plants this
slide shows the spectral signature of snap
[SPEAKER_00]: bean plants at six different growth stages
each graph has six different spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: signature curves representing each
nitrogen treatment ranging from 22 kg
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per hectare to 168 kg nitrogen
per hectare and the x-axis of these graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: is wavelength in nanometer which is
further subdivided into visible
[SPEAKER_00]: near-infrared and short-wave infrared
region the y-axis is reflectance values
[SPEAKER_00]: the red bars in these graphs represent the
top 20 wavelengths highly correlating with
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop field we observed that this
pattern of spectral signature changed
[SPEAKER_00]: across the growing season since in the
beginning of the season the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: values in the near-infrared region were
not that high however they increased
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially later in the season also
different nitrogen treatments were having
[SPEAKER_00]: specific spectral signatures the lower
nitrogen treatments shown by yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: colored lines were having higher
reflectance values in the visible and
[SPEAKER_00]: short-wave infrared region however the
higher nitrogen treatments shown by darker
[SPEAKER_00]: green lines were having higher reflectance
values in the near-infrared region the red
[SPEAKER_00]: bars that correlating with the crop field
also changed at different growth stages
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in the short-wave infrared
region in the beginning of the season and
[SPEAKER_00]: they shifted to the north near-infrared
and visible part of the spectra in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the season and they shifted more
into the visible part of the spectra later
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season this table represents the
results of random forest model which
[SPEAKER_00]: outperformed as compared to other machine
learning models at predicting end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season crop field when it was trained
using the combinations shown in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: column random forest model performed best
when it was trained using top 20
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths along with genetic environment
and management factors together as
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to all the other combinations and
our model performed really well starting
[SPEAKER_00]: from the v4 to v5 growth stage meaning
that we could use the imagery for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: yield prediction very early in the season
these two images were used for in-season
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen prediction and the red bars in
these images represent the top 20
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths highly correlating with the
in-season nitrogen percentage during the
[SPEAKER_00]: season and we observed that the top 20
wavelengths were in the visible and
[SPEAKER_00]: near-infrared region at 42 days after
planting and this slightly shifted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right side of the spectra again we
observed that random forest model
[SPEAKER_00]: performed better as compared to other
models at predicting in-season nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage when it was trained using top
20 wavelengths along with genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and management factors and the
model performed better at 42 days after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting as compared to 50 days after
planting this is a field design of kidney
[SPEAKER_00]: beans where we applied eight different
nitrogen treatments to three different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars at three different growth stages
we observed that the crop yield response
[SPEAKER_00]: was very much cultivar specific since
there was no significant difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop yield of cultivar dynasty however the
crop yield of red rover and morn canvas
[SPEAKER_00]: were significantly higher at higher
nitrogen treatments these three graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the leaf nitrogen percentage
across three different cultivars and we
[SPEAKER_00]: observed the similar trend that higher
nitrogen rates were having higher leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen percentage and the overall leaf
nitrogen percentage decreased with the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of plants we collected nine
different hyperspectral images at
[SPEAKER_00]: different growth stages of kidney beans
and we observed that in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season and at the very end of the
season when the crop is completely dry the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral signature or the reflectance
values in the near-infrared region were
[SPEAKER_00]: not that high however in the middle of the
season there was substantial increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflectance values in the red edge
region also similar to snap beans
[SPEAKER_00]: different nitrogen treatments were having
specific spectral signature and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: more evident in the middle of the season
we didn't really observe any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of the top 20 wavelengths as we
observed in snap beans but we did observe
[SPEAKER_00]: that at certain growth stages they were
more scattered and at certain growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stages they were more clustered for kidney
bean yield prediction linear regression
[SPEAKER_00]: model performed better as compared to
other models and it performed best when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was trained using top 20 wavelengths along
with genetic environment and management
[SPEAKER_00]: factors together but overall our
prediction for crop yield of kidney beans
[SPEAKER_00]: was not as good as kidney snap beans these
two dates were used for in season leaf in
[SPEAKER_00]: season nitrogen prediction of kidney beans
and we observed that the the top 20
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths highly correlating with an
leaf nitrogen percentage were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: visible part of the spectra and they were
more clustered and at 50 days after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting the top 20 wavelengths were more
scattered
[SPEAKER_00]: and random forest model performed better
at predicting in season leaf nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of kidney beans when we trained
the model using top 20 wavelengths along
[SPEAKER_00]: with genetic environment and management
factors together in conclusion we observed
[SPEAKER_00]: that higher nitrogen treatments lead to
higher crop yield and leaf nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage but the response is very much
variety dependent and the spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: signature change across different growth
stages and different nitrogen treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: have specific spectral signature the top
20 wavelengths also change across
[SPEAKER_00]: different growth stages meaning that we
might need different parts of the spectra
[SPEAKER_00]: for predicting crop yield or in season
nitrogen percentage at different growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stages we could use machine learning
models for kidney bean and snap bean yield
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction but we need both GEM factors
along with plant spectra the future work
[SPEAKER_00]: will focus on validating our models in
commercial field settings across different
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions soil types and on
different vegetable crops and the long
[SPEAKER_00]: term goal of this project is to develop
whole field maps that will help vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: growers optimize the in season fertilizer
management by keeping in mind a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: yield goal I would like to thank all the
lab members who helped in data collection
[SPEAKER_00]: and our collaborators who helped in
hyperspectral imagery collection I would
[SPEAKER_00]: also like to thank the Department of
Agriculture trade and consumer protection
[SPEAKER_00]: for funding this project and huge thanks
to synapses and the organization committee
[SPEAKER_00]: for giving me opportunity to speak here
today thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry sure so the question is that the
reflection at two micrometer like what is
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to that reflection maybe I could
go back quickly to the like the the slides
[SPEAKER_00]: here but usually in the visible part of
the spectra the reflectance is due to
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll absorption or absorption of
different pigments but in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared region the reflectance is due to
plant structure or canopy structure or
[SPEAKER_00]: cell structure and in the shortwave
infrared region the reflectance is due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the water content of the plants or dry
matter accumulation does that answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: question so the question is that what is
our hypothesis that early point is more
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive for crop yield prediction so we
observed that like the the r-scale for
[SPEAKER_00]: crop yield prediction was really good in
the beginning of the season and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: help like for example at 25 days after
planting we haven't applied our second
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen treatment yet and if we could we
would know that how much crop yield we
[SPEAKER_00]: would get and if we would be able to find
that how much nitrogen crop needs or how
[SPEAKER_00]: much nitrogen is there in the plants right
now it could help in determining the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer management or like making the
management decisions so for kidney beans
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't really get like really good
prediction early in the season but for
[SPEAKER_00]: snap beans we we did get really good
prediction at early growth stages and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason behind that could be that like and
that the top 20 wavelengths were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave infrared region and that is that
is the region where most of the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption bands are so and we had already
applied the first nitrogen treatment by
[SPEAKER_00]: that time so that that might be reflecting
due to the nitrogen first nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment application that we are seeing
differences in the plants and we are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see like what the crop yield would be
early in the season yes we did we we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: white mold on kidney beans but not on snap
beans because that was a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: duration crop and higher nitrogen
treatments were having like although I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't included the data here but higher
nitrogen treatments were having
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly higher white mold especially
later like closer to the harvesting yes
[SPEAKER_00]: there were like although the high from our
results higher nitrogen treatments were
[SPEAKER_00]: having higher crop yield but that white
mold could be a confounding factor but we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know that how to take that
out for measuring any other question yes
[SPEAKER_00]: yes we are actually trying different
techniques like we are also trying five
[SPEAKER_00]: bands or the whole spectra or just one
band and we are also trying PCA to see
[SPEAKER_00]: like which bands but like we were we were
like when we were choosing five bands or
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 bands we were not getting too much
different results so we are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: that to reduce the number of bands so we
could use take more advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral imagery and we could use
this data for maybe designing a
[SPEAKER_00]: multispectral sensor that or like deciding
that which region or which wavelengths are
[SPEAKER_00]: most important at different at a certain
growth stage yes
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah we do like it the spectral signature
is changing actually due to like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the changes in the metabolites in
the plants and for example later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season for kidney bean spectral signature
the plants are dying and that's why we are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing slightly higher reflectance values
in the red region which is due to which
[SPEAKER_00]: might be due to carotid mites but we
haven't done really done any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical analysis yet to see where the
absorption bands are or like what is it
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly leading to the change actually
when I started the project we I started
[SPEAKER_00]: with calculating different vegetation
indices and we calculated 26 different
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation indices but we were not seeing
a particular trend for example they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like at certain growth stages one
vegetation index was doing really well but
[SPEAKER_00]: at certain growth stage there was another
vegetation index which was doing well we
[SPEAKER_00]: were not able to generalize and then we
were having so many wavelengths and we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought why not like play around with data
and see what what the like better
[SPEAKER_00]: information we could get out of it and
decide that what wavelengths will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful so that's a really good question
that is the irrigated sandy soil is in
[SPEAKER_00]: central region of Wisconsin where most of
the snap bean growers are and they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: beans or even the kidney bean growers are
and we like there is a huge nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching problem there and the another
objective of this project was also to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize or to like find which nitrogen
treatment could be best for getting higher
[SPEAKER_00]: crop yield as well as it is best for from
environmental point of view so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason we decided to choose that
region but in Wisconsin they are another
[SPEAKER_00]: soil type as well in northern region it's
not completely sandy soil it's more of a
[SPEAKER_07]: clay soil or silty loam soil it is my
honor to introduce dr. Nolan Bernowski
[SPEAKER_07]: Nolan is a research scientist at the
mushroom spawn company Amacell spawn mate
[SPEAKER_07]: where he focuses on improving the white
button mushroom through genomics and
[SPEAKER_07]: bioinformatics approaches before working
as a mushroom breeder he got his masters
[SPEAKER_07]: from Michigan State in the dry breeding
and genetics program and then obtained his
[SPEAKER_07]: PhD from MSU under the guidance of dr.
Robin Buell today he will present some of
[SPEAKER_07]: highlights in mushroom breeding with his
talk titled out of the dark historical
[SPEAKER_07]: challenges and modern solutions in button
mushroom breeding please welcome Nolan to
[SPEAKER_12]: the stage okay great thanks everyone for
coming out had some great talks so yeah
[SPEAKER_12]: today I'm going to be talking about a very
unusual crop from a plant perspective we
[SPEAKER_12]: grow button mushrooms at our company here
and it certainly has a lot of complex
[SPEAKER_12]: challenges associated with this crop so
here's a little bit of an outline I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: going to start with an introduction to
introduce you to myself my company and a
[SPEAKER_12]: little bit about the system that we work
with then I'm going to dive into some of
[SPEAKER_12]: our breeding challenges and how we kind of
approach them finally I'm going to
[SPEAKER_12]: conclude with some of our research
highlights and a future outlook on the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry and our company so a little bit
about me I like to describe myself as a
[SPEAKER_12]: scientist who works with DNA sequence to
make better plants and for the past few
[SPEAKER_12]: years I can also food fungi in that this
crazy mushroom looking guy was actually me
[SPEAKER_12]: from a few years ago I'm still the crazy
mushroom guy is just harder to tell now so
[SPEAKER_12]: anyway I have a background in plant
breeding I've worked with different plant
[SPEAKER_12]: species I worked in potatoes as an
undergraduate researcher and then for my
[SPEAKER_12]: graduate degrees I worked in traditional
breeding with the dried bean breeding
[SPEAKER_12]: program and then I pursued my PhD in more
of like a computational and genomics area
[SPEAKER_12]: where I worked in maize and also some
orphan crops as well I had a stint as a in
[SPEAKER_12]: the popcorn breeding sector which was also
very fun we got a lot of pretty popcorn
[SPEAKER_12]: samples there and currently I'm a research
scientist where I use genomics and
[SPEAKER_12]: bioinformatics to help make better
mushrooms at the spawn company MSL spawn
[SPEAKER_12]: mate so you may be wondering is MSL spawn
mate well we're kind of a big deal in the
[SPEAKER_12]: mushroom industry and it's okay if you
haven't heard of us we're actually one of
[SPEAKER_12]: the three major spawn producers in the
United States and so how the system works
[SPEAKER_12]: is spawn is what we use as seeds to plant
our crop to grow mushrooms and the spawn
[SPEAKER_12]: is just actually grain that's colonized by
mycelia so our two main goals are to
[SPEAKER_12]: develop new mushroom strains and we also
make spawn for our mushroom growers our
[SPEAKER_12]: company is vertically integrated this
means that we can grow mushrooms on our
[SPEAKER_12]: own farms and we have farms across the
United States Mexico and France so we can
[SPEAKER_12]: bring our consumers very fresh product we
can move these mushrooms around using a
[SPEAKER_12]: transportation company that we are also
associated with and then we sell our
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms under the Monterey mushrooms
label if you ever see this in the grocery
[SPEAKER_12]: stores and our main focus and what I'm
gonna spend most of the talk today on is
[SPEAKER_12]: agaricus bisporus or the button mushroom
for reference we have about 75% of the
[SPEAKER_12]: brown mushroom market share and the brown
mushrooms in this context are the same as
[SPEAKER_12]: the white mushrooms they're all from the
same species agaricus bisporus just with a
[SPEAKER_12]: different cap color so like I said we're
one of the major spawn producers in the US
[SPEAKER_12]: our our office is located in a very modest
building in central coast of California
[SPEAKER_12]: and in addition to those major goals there
we also serve as a research engine so
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a lot of unresolved you know
science and questions in the mushroom
[SPEAKER_12]: breeding realm and we have a small group
but we also spend a part of our resources
[SPEAKER_12]: to develop and develop resources to try to
better understand what are we actually
[SPEAKER_12]: doing and how does our crop work so it's a
very small group we have a director we
[SPEAKER_12]: have about five research scientists on
staff we have lab assistants to help with
[SPEAKER_12]: the wet lab things support staff and some
growing technicians who actually are in
[SPEAKER_12]: charge of spawning or seeding the rooms
and creating our trials and then
[SPEAKER_12]: harvesting the mushrooms we also provide
other services to our country or to our
[SPEAKER_12]: company we certify our strains before we
release them commercially we test and
[SPEAKER_12]: analyze mushroom substrates and this is
important this would be analogous to doing
[SPEAKER_12]: soil testing services to bring it into a
plant realm we develop new products and we
[SPEAKER_12]: also provide strain ID and disease testing
for some of our companies that we sell our
[SPEAKER_12]: spawn to we sell the seed so the button
mushroom we've kind of already established
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a pretty niche crop it's a hybrid
crop that's colonly propagated and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: perishable but it has high value and
requires high input so just looking at
[SPEAKER_12]: that I think the closest plant system that
I can think of it's pretty similar to
[SPEAKER_12]: strawberries in this regard but certainly
other berries could be considered as being
[SPEAKER_12]: similar to I pulled some data from the
2023 US economics to look at the crop
[SPEAKER_12]: values and I have them sorted according to
this leftmost y-axis so the data will be
[SPEAKER_12]: highlighted in blue is the total
production value in billions of dollars
[SPEAKER_12]: obviously corn is king here no surprise
there and you know soybeans are also take
[SPEAKER_12]: up take up a lot of the the market
mushrooms are down over here there they
[SPEAKER_12]: have a very small total value in terms of
the economic output in the US however I
[SPEAKER_12]: would like to highlight the right side
y-axis which is the price per pound so you
[SPEAKER_12]: can see that they have very high value in
this regard also similar to strawberries
[SPEAKER_12]: and some other you could say more minor
crops I'm going to focus and highlight
[SPEAKER_12]: this this little modest segment here we
have about a billion dollars of total
[SPEAKER_12]: value in 2023 and this pie chart is
breaking it down by the different sectors
[SPEAKER_12]: and the blue is what I would like to
highlight most of our mushrooms go towards
[SPEAKER_12]: fresh market however we do have mushroom
segments that are used for processing like
[SPEAKER_12]: we go and look a process soup for example
and there's also a segment for specialty
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms these would be other mushrooms
like you may have heard of like shiitake
[SPEAKER_12]: or oyster or turkey tail things like that
however most of our revenue stream comes
[SPEAKER_12]: from breeding agaricus by sports for fresh
market so I need to introduce a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: about button mushroom biology they belong
to some fungi called the psidiomyces and
[SPEAKER_12]: they're called club fungi because of the
shape of their spores they kind of look
[SPEAKER_12]: like a club the white mushrooms and the
brown mushrooms are all part of this club
[SPEAKER_12]: if you will so the only difference is they
have different cap colors furthermore the
[SPEAKER_12]: differences between what you might see in
the store market is cremini mushrooms or
[SPEAKER_12]: baby bella's and corda bella's is just a
difference when they were harvested at
[SPEAKER_12]: different maturities there are certain
considerations from a breeding perspective
[SPEAKER_12]: if we want to breed for cremini mushrooms
which are harvested small versus corda
[SPEAKER_12]: bella's which are harvested later
considering the speed that the caps
[SPEAKER_12]: develop and the gills open up so some
other psidiomyces you may have heard of
[SPEAKER_12]: include polypores these are like the shelf
fungi that grow on trees an example of
[SPEAKER_12]: this here is turkey tail beautiful and
from a plant scientist perspective I had
[SPEAKER_12]: grown so accustomed to thinking of fungi
as the enemy because we typically see them
[SPEAKER_12]: you know in this kind of pathogenic world
so some example of other psidiomyces
[SPEAKER_12]: include rusts and smuts as far as when I
say the term mushroom let's just get on
[SPEAKER_12]: the same page the mushroom is just the
fleshy spore bearing brooding body and to
[SPEAKER_12]: make an analogous to plants we have our
mycelia down here which would forage for
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients like the roots the stem which
provides support to the structure and then
[SPEAKER_12]: the marketable portion up here is the cap
and this would be the fruit or the part of
[SPEAKER_12]: the plant that's sold now we're going to
introduce a few concepts that will be most
[SPEAKER_12]: like before and so they all come from
greek which is really fun if you're a fan
[SPEAKER_12]: of my big fat greek wedding but these
terms are homoherions versus heteroherions
[SPEAKER_12]: so in this fungus we have homoherions that
are either spores or mycelium that have an
[SPEAKER_12]: identical nuclei type these would be our
haploids we also have heteroherions and
[SPEAKER_12]: this refers to spores or mycelium with two
different nuclei these are also called
[SPEAKER_12]: dicarions because they have one haploid
set coexisting in the same cell with a
[SPEAKER_12]: different haploid set I found this life
cycle figure from a textbook and I think
[SPEAKER_12]: it's it demonstrates a general psidiomyces
life cycle there are some works about our
[SPEAKER_12]: specific mushroom that we're talking about
here and I will be sure to describe them
[SPEAKER_12]: so let's start at the beginning as they
say in step one here we see we see mycelia
[SPEAKER_12]: of two different mating types colored as a
blue mating type here and a red mating
[SPEAKER_12]: type here these mating types if they're
compatible will fuse together in step two
[SPEAKER_12]: here the step is called plasmagmy and
they'll produce this dicariotic mycelium
[SPEAKER_12]: so again these two nuclear types are
coexisting in the same house or in the
[SPEAKER_12]: same cell then step three step three
occurs when we provide the correct
[SPEAKER_12]: substrate and the right environmental
conditions the mushroom might the mycelia
[SPEAKER_12]: will grow and produce a fruiting body this
is also called a besidio carp inside of
[SPEAKER_12]: the gills of this besidio carp we have our
two nuclei still coexisting they haven't
[SPEAKER_12]: you know necessarily combined yet they're
still existing separately they're still
[SPEAKER_12]: existing separately inside the besidio so
now we're getting into start starting the
[SPEAKER_12]: reproductive process created starting to
create the spores themselves in the
[SPEAKER_12]: besidio they undergo karyogamy so the two
nuclei finally merge together and then in
[SPEAKER_12]: the same into one cell and this is where
we get the diploid zygote portion of the
[SPEAKER_12]: life cycle this undergoes meiosis it's not
a typical meiosis there's some quirks
[SPEAKER_12]: about that which i'll talk about in future
slides but as a general result we do
[SPEAKER_12]: expect to see four haploid nuclei as the
result of meiosis these occur in the
[SPEAKER_12]: besidium they're not yet packaged into
spores this is where it gets a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: weird with our crop because in typical
besidio mycetes they have these four
[SPEAKER_12]: spores and each spore gets one haploid
nucleus however in agaricus by spores
[SPEAKER_12]: there's typically only two spores produced
and each of these spores contain the
[SPEAKER_12]: parental nuclei so essentially it's
repackaging its myotic products into a
[SPEAKER_12]: spore that can be used to recreate itself
and this this is a challenge so finally in
[SPEAKER_12]: step eight we get this dispersal and
germination in the very rare case in our
[SPEAKER_12]: crop we have besidio spores containing one
haploid nucleus nuclei nucleus are and
[SPEAKER_12]: these would be considered these homo
karyans will germinate to create haploid
[SPEAKER_12]: mycelia this happens very rarely
unfortunately the more common case is
[SPEAKER_12]: where we get dikaryotic spores germinating
to produce dikaryotic mycelia that in turn
[SPEAKER_12]: will create dikaryotic mushrooms without
having any kind of introduction of genetic
[SPEAKER_12]: diversity so the button mushroom requires
a nutrient they require certain substrates
[SPEAKER_12]: to grow and in nature they get these
nutrients from manure or leaf litter shown
[SPEAKER_12]: here is an example of a cypress tree and
these are native to the central coast of
[SPEAKER_12]: california where my company is located and
button mushrooms are found commonly
[SPEAKER_12]: associated in the litter leaf litter of
these cypress trees however from a
[SPEAKER_12]: production standpoint we create our own
substrates in the case of spawn this is
[SPEAKER_12]: the grain that's colonized by our hybrid
mycelia for agronomic trials we use small
[SPEAKER_12]: amounts of spawn we use we put the grain
in flasks and inoculate the flasks with
[SPEAKER_12]: little pieces of mycelia these micellia
then colonize the grain until you get this
[SPEAKER_12]: mixture here which is ready to plant or we
call it spawning in a commercial setting
[SPEAKER_12]: we use these larger bags filled with grain
and nutrients and mycelia these bags have
[SPEAKER_12]: strips that allow the exchange of heat and
gases and they're stored in these climate
[SPEAKER_12]: controlled rooms so we can better monitor
their growth and progress we also generate
[SPEAKER_12]: our own compounds compost this is done at
a very large scale you can see here this
[SPEAKER_12]: blue circle is highlighting a person for
some scale this compost is generated from
[SPEAKER_12]: mixing wheat horse manure oil and some
nitrogen and we let it naturally break
[SPEAKER_12]: down for a couple weeks it also undergoes
a pasteurization step after this which
[SPEAKER_12]: breaks it down even further now this is
helpful because this changes the
[SPEAKER_12]: microbiome of the compost and in general
agaricus by spores is pretty tolerant of
[SPEAKER_12]: out competing any other kind of microbes
in the compost so it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_12]: like sterile sterile if you will when we
get to actually cultivating the mushroom
[SPEAKER_12]: we plant them this is called spawning
where we mix our spawn and our compost the
[SPEAKER_12]: mycelia will will colonize this compost in
all directions and after about two weeks
[SPEAKER_12]: it's been the compost has been colonized
enough and we add a casing layer this is
[SPEAKER_12]: just a low nutrient layer that the mycelia
will grow into they will expand and it
[SPEAKER_12]: will force the mycelia up into this layer
this also helps with watering so just like
[SPEAKER_12]: any other crop we need to water the
mushrooms and making sure that we have
[SPEAKER_12]: enough air space for the water to actually
get used up by the mushroom is important
[SPEAKER_12]: next part is we flush the room and this is
also referred to as a break this is where
[SPEAKER_12]: we stimulate fruiting by manipulating the
environment so we decrease the amount of
[SPEAKER_12]: carbon dioxide that we pump into the rooms
and we lower the temperatures and this
[SPEAKER_12]: stimulates the mushroom to say okay it's
time to create a mushroom typically we
[SPEAKER_12]: harvest these mushrooms over five days or
so then we allow them about three or so
[SPEAKER_12]: days to regrow and reform new mushrooms in
total we repeat this process about two to
[SPEAKER_12]: three times so we have two to three breaks
per planting and each time we can say we
[SPEAKER_12]: get about four to eight pounds per square
foot per flush obviously there's yield
[SPEAKER_12]: decreases with each flush that we get and
this is typical like you would see in like
[SPEAKER_12]: other retune crops for example in our case
it's due to disease pressure mostly but
[SPEAKER_12]: also the nutrient availability will
decrease slightly so here's an example of
[SPEAKER_12]: where we grow the mushrooms contrary to
popular belief we don't have an elaborate
[SPEAKER_12]: cave system we grow these mushrooms in the
case of for our commercial tests in these
[SPEAKER_12]: walk-in freezer type rooms that are
climate controlled and when we do these
[SPEAKER_12]: tests we grow them in smaller wooden boxes
that are filled with compost and mycelia
[SPEAKER_12]: and we fruit them with mushrooms and this
is at this point I need to mention that
[SPEAKER_12]: this is a year-round endeavor the growing
the mushrooms because we have them in a
[SPEAKER_12]: climate controlled environment there's no
planting season or growing season planting
[SPEAKER_12]: season is every day growing season is
every day in fact we take measurements on
[SPEAKER_12]: these mushrooms every day because their
growth is so fast so we're always
[SPEAKER_12]: collecting field data every single day and
using that to quickly turn over and
[SPEAKER_12]: generate our our blinds that we want to
select and here I have a picture of our
[SPEAKER_12]: newest member to the team Chloe they were
a former Cornell grad from the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: pathology department so it's great to have
have them on board collecting this
[SPEAKER_12]: important agronomic data for us on the
right side here I'm showing an example of
[SPEAKER_12]: the commercial production rooms so this is
done at a much larger scale obviously than
[SPEAKER_12]: how we would test or trial our new strains
and you see these these are also very
[SPEAKER_12]: large wooden beds or trays that are filled
with compost and spawn and mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_12]: grown and manually harvested so this
requires quite a large amount of labor now
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of giving you the broad overview of
the steps in the button mushroom breeding
[SPEAKER_12]: production I'm gonna lay it out and put it
all together and this is from the
[SPEAKER_12]: perspective of a mushroom breeder so we
start with our germplasm as all good
[SPEAKER_12]: breeding programs do we have our
proprietary mushroom strains from these
[SPEAKER_12]: strains we isolate spores we let the
mushrooms grow and mature and then spores
[SPEAKER_12]: will drop and we can pick out individual
spores we grow these up on plates and let
[SPEAKER_12]: them germinate into mycelia crossing is
actually pretty easy you can just take a
[SPEAKER_12]: chunk of one mycelia and put it on a plate
with another chunk from a different one
[SPEAKER_12]: and if you're lucky they will hybridize
and grow together so that's they will
[SPEAKER_12]: essentially merge and cross with itself
all by itself once we have this mycelia we
[SPEAKER_12]: transfer this to a mixture of grain and
nutrients this would be our spawn you can
[SPEAKER_12]: see a little more clearly in this example
a commercial spawn bag here with these
[SPEAKER_12]: growth breathing strips from the spawn we
combine the spawn and compost and under
[SPEAKER_12]: the correct management practices we can
grow our mushrooms these mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_12]: then harvested and packaged and finally
they are shipped to the end user where you
[SPEAKER_12]: can go to the store and purchase them and
put them on your pizza or whatever you
[SPEAKER_12]: want to do from a breeder's perspective
this growing stage this agronomic data is
[SPEAKER_12]: used where we select our mushrooms based
on this stage however I have highlighted
[SPEAKER_12]: in these red outlines here there's other
considerations that we need to think of
[SPEAKER_12]: there's other stakeholders involved in
this process and you consider the growers
[SPEAKER_12]: how do we make this crop grower friendly
and resilient to different environmental
[SPEAKER_12]: conditions but also the consumers you know
freshness and flavor and cap you know
[SPEAKER_12]: certain cap characteristics are also
important I'm going to talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: about the cultivation history so when I
talk about bush button mushroom breeding
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a very recent phenomenon and like any
good former corn person I have to mention
[SPEAKER_12]: maize in one of my presentations and I
just put this in here because this
[SPEAKER_12]: happened maize domestication happened
about you know 6,000 years ago and I like
[SPEAKER_12]: to highlight this because you can see the
different morphological changes that we
[SPEAKER_12]: that breeders change this crop from the
wild grass teosinte to the corn that we
[SPEAKER_12]: work with you know and grow on millions of
acres around the world today so our story
[SPEAKER_12]: our mushroom story actually begins in the
1600s this was the first time there was a
[SPEAKER_12]: concerted large-scale cultivation and this
was done in underground systems in France
[SPEAKER_12]: in the 1900s we see large-scale spawn
production in the United States so this is
[SPEAKER_12]: consciously generating spawn that can be
used to grow mushrooms and introducing
[SPEAKER_12]: good practices to maintain single single
strains or single lines of spawn the early
[SPEAKER_12]: 1980s saw a milestone development and this
was the development of the you forced you
[SPEAKER_12]: one strain this was the first time that
there was actual deliberate crossing or
[SPEAKER_12]: deliberate breeding going on in this crowd
I have this this gray arrow here because
[SPEAKER_12]: this you one strain is the progenitor for
most of the white button mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll see even today 2016 was a big year
because there was a scientist at Penn
[SPEAKER_12]: State who developed a gene edited mushroom
with the goal of reducing cap bruising
[SPEAKER_12]: however since this there's no actual
published paper of researchers from this
[SPEAKER_12]: all we get with is this research highlight
and since then there haven't been any
[SPEAKER_12]: commercial gene edited or transgenic
mushrooms on the market looking to the
[SPEAKER_12]: future I think it's important to have an
open mind with not only gene editing but
[SPEAKER_12]: also where can we take the crop I'm going
to look back at May's and you can see
[SPEAKER_12]: these dramatic morphological differences I
would argue that right now mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_12]: in the still in the domestication phase
rather than the improvement phase so I
[SPEAKER_12]: think it'd be really I'm really excited to
see where we can go from here and as a
[SPEAKER_12]: genomicist or someone who works with
sequence data a lot I would be remiss if I
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't talk about reference genomes and
the button mushroom genome we had our
[SPEAKER_12]: first genome assembly was published in
2012 and currently we're on version three
[SPEAKER_12]: these are genomes for the constituent homo
carions of that you one strain that I
[SPEAKER_12]: mentioned and specifically I'm going to
give some metrics for each 97 this was one
[SPEAKER_12]: of those haploids that were involved in
that cross there's about 31 million base
[SPEAKER_12]: pairs in this genome which would take you
a long time to count but in more like
[SPEAKER_12]: general terms it's similar with other
fungi but it's not really that big we
[SPEAKER_12]: scale it here a hundred times and you can
see it's really quite small compared to
[SPEAKER_12]: some other popular organisms that are that
are well studied and this is great for
[SPEAKER_12]: anyone who wants to do sequencing or
genomics because we can sequence a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: things and get great coverage so the busco
is just the number of single copy
[SPEAKER_12]: orthologs and it's used to measure
completeness of the genome assembly and
[SPEAKER_12]: we're doing pretty good at 93 percent of
those orthologs present in single copy as
[SPEAKER_12]: about 12,000 genes for reference it's
about half as many genes and humans and
[SPEAKER_12]: about a third as many genes in maize and
we also have about 12 percent of the
[SPEAKER_12]: genome was found to be transposable
elements so that was some background and
[SPEAKER_12]: now I'm going to get to the meat of all of
the challenges that we're facing I've kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of broadly separated them into breeding
challenges and biological challenges but
[SPEAKER_12]: there is going to be some overlap the
first challenge is there's a brief
[SPEAKER_12]: domestication history we saw in the
earlier slide processing really has only
[SPEAKER_12]: been going on for about 50 years in this
crop the good news is that today we have
[SPEAKER_12]: modern tools like sequencing and using
good database management and experimental
[SPEAKER_12]: design so this will allow us to catch up
to other crops there's also this narrow
[SPEAKER_12]: genetic base this u1 strain has been
around for the past 50 years and continues
[SPEAKER_12]: to be used in many commercial programs so
to introduce diversity we can go back and
[SPEAKER_12]: use wild germplasm to also use molecular
tools like create the diversity if we
[SPEAKER_12]: can't find it in nature this would involve
things like mutagenesis or gene editing
[SPEAKER_12]: again I have to mention that no commercial
mushrooms currently exist that are derived
[SPEAKER_12]: from those tools there's been limited
scientific research involved obviously
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a niche crop and there's only about a
handful of research institutions in button
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms around the world so we have
expertise that has kind of spread thin and
[SPEAKER_12]: as a solution you know it would be great
if we could increase funding gain some
[SPEAKER_12]: more awareness attract a different talent
pool and also collaborate with people who
[SPEAKER_12]: you know we have a small group at our
company but if we can outsource some work
[SPEAKER_12]: and or some questions to other groups that
would great that would be great and help
[SPEAKER_12]: us make progress another consideration is
it's difficult to protect our IP so
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms kind of exist in this legal
limbo they're not animals they're not
[SPEAKER_12]: plants we do have the ability to use
utility patents so that's that's something
[SPEAKER_12]: that's good but in general they can be
clonally propagated so what would be the
[SPEAKER_12]: incentive in spending all these resources
to develop a new strain that you know a
[SPEAKER_12]: competitor can just go and take without
fear of legal ramifications and so we
[SPEAKER_12]: would like to work more closely with
regulatory bodies to kind of make sure
[SPEAKER_12]: that we can set a legal landscape that
would help us create and protect our
[SPEAKER_12]: strains on the biological side I've hinted
at this it's difficult to produce our
[SPEAKER_12]: haploid and we also have limited genetic
recombination so you address the this we
[SPEAKER_12]: can use markers we can introduce new
germplasm but this is one of the main
[SPEAKER_12]: challenges that's been facing the industry
for quite some time we also have mating
[SPEAKER_12]: types so even if you do isolate haploid
the presence of mating types means that
[SPEAKER_12]: they may not be compatible they may not
actually fuse together if they have the
[SPEAKER_12]: same mating type again we can examine to
see our germplasm if our germplasm is
[SPEAKER_12]: having this certain mating types using
markers and sequencing mushrooms require
[SPEAKER_12]: specific growth conditions it's it would
be important to have mushrooms that are
[SPEAKER_12]: resilient not only to different conditions
and different management practices but
[SPEAKER_12]: also have the ability to adapt to those
different management practices like how
[SPEAKER_12]: much water is being used and what are the
temperature changes like in that growing
[SPEAKER_12]: environment and last but not least quality
is important so if you've ever gone to the
[SPEAKER_12]: grocery store and tried to purchase
mushrooms you know that by the time it
[SPEAKER_12]: gets to the end user maybe they're not as
fresh as you would hope well you know we
[SPEAKER_12]: can address this by looking at consumer
panels and breeding making a conscious
[SPEAKER_12]: effort to breed for quality I have gene
editing here as a question mark because
[SPEAKER_12]: this was what that 2016 Penn State
researcher was kind of thinking about the
[SPEAKER_12]: quality aspect and reducing cap bruising
okay so I'm gonna dive into challenge
[SPEAKER_12]: number one was this narrow germplasm base
remember when I said we start with these
[SPEAKER_12]: unique strains this unique germplasm well
typically actually it's kind of harder
[SPEAKER_12]: than it than it seems to have that unique
strains before the 1980s we had these
[SPEAKER_12]: heirloom heirloom strains where growers
would grow a mushroom they would collect
[SPEAKER_12]: these dicaryotic fertile spurs and culture
them up and grow a new mushroom from that
[SPEAKER_12]: the problem is is there's not really a lot
of genetic recombination in the crop but
[SPEAKER_12]: we do get some rearrangement of the
parental chromosomes so you're basically
[SPEAKER_12]: just shuffling chromosomes around these
different mushroom strains and then in the
[SPEAKER_12]: 1980s we saw the development of this
horsey one strain and it was a cross
[SPEAKER_12]: between two haploid from different
traditional strains immediately they saw
[SPEAKER_12]: yield and quality improvements compared to
the existing strains and it achieved rapid
[SPEAKER_12]: market dominance that continues to this
day to get new varieties from this they
[SPEAKER_12]: developed they took those dicaryotic
fertile spores like this and grew up new
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms much like this process that was
being done previously so there's still not
[SPEAKER_12]: a huge genetic base for our crop okay so
when you say okay well what if we solve
[SPEAKER_12]: this challenge we solve the uniqueness
challenge well now we can just isolate
[SPEAKER_12]: spores right well the problem with that is
that it's harder than it looks because
[SPEAKER_12]: most spores we can't use for breeding we
have a unique sporo genesis process that
[SPEAKER_12]: inhibits the formation of these haploid so
just to demonstrate this here's our n plus
[SPEAKER_12]: n our hetero karyon or dicaryotic sporo
carb mushroom in the gill tissue we have
[SPEAKER_12]: again the dicaryotic basidium hanging up
this will fuse to create our diploid
[SPEAKER_12]: zygote and undergo meiosis so in the post
myotic basidium we have our four haploid
[SPEAKER_12]: nuclei great you're saying what's the
issue the issue is that as the basidium
[SPEAKER_12]: matures those four nuclei get packaged
differently into the different spores so
[SPEAKER_12]: the nuclei migrate into basidia spores
only about five percent of the time the
[SPEAKER_12]: basidia make homo karyon spores these are
our inbred lines that we can use for
[SPEAKER_12]: breeding and they contain one haploid
nuclear type per spore in this diagram i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: coloring nuclear types as either the blue
color or the red color and anytime you see
[SPEAKER_12]: like a little segment like this means that
there's been some kind of cross uh
[SPEAKER_12]: crossover event or a different independent
assortment from the other parent 95
[SPEAKER_12]: percent of the time 95 percent of the
spores we get are hetero karyotic spores
[SPEAKER_12]: and in the most common scenario we call
these end progeny these are self-fertile
[SPEAKER_12]: spores and they contain the parental type
nuclei in the same spore this is also
[SPEAKER_12]: where we get the name agaricus by spores
because instead of like other basidium
[SPEAKER_12]: mycetes producing four spores our spores
we get two spores per basidia also rarely
[SPEAKER_12]: we get these s progeny and this is where
the sister nuclei from the from the
[SPEAKER_12]: meiosis get packaged in the same spore and
this has variable self-fertility we don't
[SPEAKER_12]: know if there was a recombination event
with a different mating type which would
[SPEAKER_12]: allow it to be fertile or not but this is
a huge challenge because when you look at
[SPEAKER_12]: the spores that we can use for breeding
that have some recombination it's just
[SPEAKER_12]: these two scenarios out of these more
vastly more common scenarios here a third
[SPEAKER_12]: challenge is a low recombination rate so
we have this meiosis occurring in the
[SPEAKER_12]: developing basidium and there's not a lot
of recombination the recombination we do
[SPEAKER_12]: get is in subtelomeric regions i pulled
this figure from a 2016 paper and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: showing the haplotype of a commercial uh
white strain so the blue represents the
[SPEAKER_12]: sequence that was derived from the u1
homocharion h-97 and the red is the
[SPEAKER_12]: sequence from the u1 h-39 homocharion and
you can see this is a commercial strain
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's essentially the same as the u1
strain with some a little bit of crossover
[SPEAKER_12]: events we do have the advantage i guess
that it's we have appear to have normal
[SPEAKER_12]: independent assortment of homologous
chromosomes and this is what we this is
[SPEAKER_12]: the end result here where we get a little
bit of recombination if you will or
[SPEAKER_12]: different parental material in these
spores but you can see that overall these
[SPEAKER_12]: spores maintain heterozygosity we have a
lot of approaches to these life cycle
[SPEAKER_12]: challenges and they involve a lot of
manual labor so we collect a lot of single
[SPEAKER_12]: spore isolates and then culture them up to
mycelia we're always looking for ways to
[SPEAKER_12]: automate this and you know one potential
way we can do this is by looking at also
[SPEAKER_12]: is by looking at differential or selective
media to choose to select for or against
[SPEAKER_12]: haploids or dicarions we also screen
mycelia visually in general the haploid
[SPEAKER_12]: are they don't perform they don't grow as
fast as the heterocharians this is not
[SPEAKER_12]: always the case however so instead we can
use markers we have molecular markers for
[SPEAKER_12]: mating type and cap color and some others
around the genome and this is very useful
[SPEAKER_12]: for screening we also screen them to
determine ploidy status so from a
[SPEAKER_12]: bioinformatics perspective where i'm
coming from this is pretty straightforward
[SPEAKER_12]: we can look at the sequence metrics
alignments and do some variant calling but
[SPEAKER_12]: ultimately our long-term goals are we want
to increase those recombination rates and
[SPEAKER_12]: the frequency of plomacarian besidia
spores some routes for this are using
[SPEAKER_12]: existing genetic variation for
recombination rate and again if we don't
[SPEAKER_12]: have that using potentially using some
molecular tricks or techniques that i
[SPEAKER_12]: mentioned earlier our fourth challenge is
this challenge about mating types so even
[SPEAKER_12]: if we do isolate our genetically unique
spores and culture them up you put them on
[SPEAKER_12]: a plate they won't always grow together
and create that hybrid you'll know if you
[SPEAKER_12]: have a compatible reaction because you'll
see the formation of this fluffy aerial
[SPEAKER_12]: mycelia that's dicaryotic and this
requires different alleles at the mating
[SPEAKER_12]: type locus a 1994 paper by kerrigan et al
identified eight mating types and we have
[SPEAKER_12]: also identified a lot more mating types
than just one or two however you'll see
[SPEAKER_12]: the most popular mating types are mating
types one and two and this is because
[SPEAKER_12]: these were the mating types that were
found in that u1 strain that we made 50
[SPEAKER_12]: years ago we can use tester lines to
determine mating types however you know we
[SPEAKER_12]: like to think we're you know moving along
and progressing so these days we use PCR
[SPEAKER_12]: markers the older markers were good at
distinguishing mating types one and two
[SPEAKER_12]: but now we have better tools where we
we've sequenced different haplotypes and
[SPEAKER_12]: we can use that sequence to make markers
this is work done by a research scientist
[SPEAKER_12]: daniel steel and we can see on this gel it
can easily distinguish a homocharion
[SPEAKER_12]: containing just a single m1 band from for
example a heterocharion that has this m1
[SPEAKER_12]: band but also a mating type 3 band also I
quickly highlight some trait mapping work
[SPEAKER_12]: so I know trait mapping isn't as sexy as
it was like 20 years ago but remember like
[SPEAKER_12]: we're still kind of figuring out this
breeding thing so the existing maps that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're out there they weren't really
sufficient and sometimes they're missing
[SPEAKER_12]: whole chromosomes so we said okay roll up
our sleeves like we can get this done
[SPEAKER_12]: ourselves we did the regular way you would
go about you know doing a trait mapping
[SPEAKER_12]: study assemble some diversity sequence it
measurement and here's just a highlight of
[SPEAKER_12]: some unfiltered data sets here we found
this qtl for cap color on chromosome 8
[SPEAKER_12]: this has also been found independently by
other research groups in the future of
[SPEAKER_12]: mushroom research I really think we need
some more basic research to break this
[SPEAKER_12]: cycle we need to look into meiosis and
spora genesis and figure out what is the
[SPEAKER_12]: genetic control of this packaging and what
is wrong with us that we can't get the
[SPEAKER_12]: recombination that we see in other crops
soma clonal variation is also and
[SPEAKER_12]: epigenetics are also important because
this is a clonally propagated crop and so
[SPEAKER_12]: anytime you have this subculturing being
done this is immediately where my mind
[SPEAKER_12]: goes the cellular composition and
subgenome dominance are some aspects that
[SPEAKER_12]: we should also consider because we have
these two different parents essentially
[SPEAKER_12]: existing in the same cell so how does that
affect things like expression is this
[SPEAKER_12]: different across tissue types or growth
stages lastly I'd like to test traditional
[SPEAKER_12]: methods in the words of my former advisor
trust but verify so the mushroom industry
[SPEAKER_12]: has been doing things for a certain way
for a certain for a long period of years
[SPEAKER_12]: and it would be great just to approach
this with a with a new eyes in the future
[SPEAKER_12]: for our company we're still all about
variety release we have a new white strain
[SPEAKER_12]: that's gaining popularity we also have a
very successful brown strain that's coming
[SPEAKER_12]: off patent currently and we're always
looking to make things more efficient
[SPEAKER_12]: through screening or trialing from for me
a genomicist I think genomic selection
[SPEAKER_12]: would be a very interesting route to go
down again we also do basic research we're
[SPEAKER_12]: scaling up our sequencing efforts we're
also looking at having some partnerships
[SPEAKER_12]: to help us tackle some of these challenges
and then having an open mind thinking
[SPEAKER_12]: about alternative uses about the what
about metabolites secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_12]: can we market nutraceuticals more are
there health benefits among about that and
[SPEAKER_12]: then using mushrooms for textiles or
environmental remediation and then not
[SPEAKER_12]: only considering the button mushroom
there's a lot of other mushrooms out there
[SPEAKER_12]: just being open to thinking about how can
we breed those other systems so thank you
[SPEAKER_12]: for having me here's some acknowledgments
I'd like to thank the graduate students
[SPEAKER_12]: and Corteva for this symposium you know
the engagement has been great I also want
[SPEAKER_12]: to thank my co-workers that you know
they're they work hard they have good
[SPEAKER_12]: attitudes and that you know we all were
working on this really frustrating but
[SPEAKER_12]: also fun crop so thank you
[SPEAKER_12]: the reason yeah so the reason for calling
it a hybrid is because essentially it is
[SPEAKER_12]: we have a haploid combined with another
haploid like our gametes like our pollen
[SPEAKER_12]: you know like in corn but they just they
live together in the same cell before you
[SPEAKER_12]: know I guess yeah getting together I do
think that we when I think of hybrids like
[SPEAKER_12]: maze I think of heterosis you know
complementary gene action things like that
[SPEAKER_12]: and that is something that we have seen so
to have some different different haploid
[SPEAKER_12]: different nuclear types coming together
that has been very productive for us
[SPEAKER_12]: we have not done that to my knowledge I
think that would be very interesting to
[SPEAKER_12]: examine yeah sorry thank you their
question was can we distinguish the
[SPEAKER_12]: homocharion versus the heterocharions by
flow cell cytometry is that correct yeah
[SPEAKER_12]: and worse that is something that's
interesting that's a good question I don't
[SPEAKER_12]: know the answer to that I think that would
be something that we could definitely
[SPEAKER_12]: market I think we would be very
competitive in that compared to some of
[SPEAKER_12]: those other mentions so he was asking
about the efficiency of the mushrooms
[SPEAKER_12]: compared to chickens or or other energy
sources but essentially with you know I
[SPEAKER_12]: think it's I think we would we would come
out pretty well in that regard especially
[SPEAKER_12]: with you know climate change friendly and
like vegan alternatives being more and
[SPEAKER_12]: more common yes so their question was what
kind of wild germplasm are we talking
[SPEAKER_12]: about and what do they look like there
there are some wild strains that are part
[SPEAKER_12]: of a collection there was a big collection
effort that happened in the 1990s we do
[SPEAKER_12]: have access to a lot of those strains in
our program a lot of those those strains
[SPEAKER_12]: are very small so that the size of the
mushroom is very small and they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: always grow in the evenly distribution
even distribution are on the surface
[SPEAKER_12]: furthermore they open up very quickly so
they complete their life cycle from the
[SPEAKER_12]: mushroom development and then they open up
their caps want to release their spores
[SPEAKER_12]: immediately kind of like seed dispersal in
other in other crops and we really don't
[SPEAKER_12]: want to see that we want to see a mushroom
that is very slow and like holds on and
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't mature that fast because then we
can you know it makes it easier to ship it
[SPEAKER_12]: around and you get the consumer gets a
fresher mushroom so yeah the size of the
[SPEAKER_12]: mushroom and like the speed and their
their growth pattern yes so the question
[SPEAKER_12]: was asking about the mycelial composition
during the flushes of the harvest
[SPEAKER_12]: successive harvests and then also what do
we do with the compost so to answer the
[SPEAKER_12]: first question we do see a little bit more
colonization with each flush so we do have
[SPEAKER_12]: multiple flushes and with each flush the
mushrooms will come up again a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: in general and the pattern is like the
first flush will be the most productive
[SPEAKER_12]: second flush will be okay and then the
third flush that's really growers
[SPEAKER_12]: typically make their money even though
there's because these are a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: tight harvesting but the third flush will
have fewer mushrooms but they'll still be
[SPEAKER_12]: around and after that third flush we can
we do we can use that compost and recycle
[SPEAKER_12]: that back into our production because
that's becoming a bigger thing with the
[SPEAKER_12]: scarcity of peat and you know climate
change and trying to consider alternative
[SPEAKER_12]: composts since we are developing and like
creating our own composts you know it
[SPEAKER_12]: quickly adds up and we try to have a very
consistent product but when we're making
[SPEAKER_12]: these huge batches you know we just we
have to be sure that we're testing them to
[SPEAKER_12]: make sure the percent nitrogen is within
certain guidelines and the percent you
[SPEAKER_12]: know whatever is as consistent as we can
get it yeah so the question was how do we
[SPEAKER_12]: prevent fungal pathogens of our fungus
during the growing and we have an IPM
[SPEAKER_12]: system so we have during the harvest our
harvesters will use gloves and like we
[SPEAKER_12]: have a decontamination like protocol so
that's just keeping maintaining like clean
[SPEAKER_12]: you know practices helps we also have a
pest that is difficult to somewhat
[SPEAKER_12]: difficult because it can fly it can move
around so we have there'd be like these
[SPEAKER_12]: small flies if you have like house plants
would be like fungus gnats they kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: look like and those can be vectors for
some diseases like on the caps or whatever
[SPEAKER_12]: they can spread that and so to control for
those we have like fly paper like at the
[SPEAKER_12]: entrances and exits of our growing rooms
and that really helps cut down on some of
[SPEAKER_12]: that disease yeah that's a good question
so the question was asking about how easy
[SPEAKER_12]: is it to transform mushrooms or use some
of these molecular tools it seems from
[SPEAKER_12]: reading literature this has been done in
other crops and other similar mushroomy
[SPEAKER_12]: type crops for example yeast is a fungus
and that's pretty amenable to
[SPEAKER_12]: transformation and you know that paper
that 2016 gene editing you know study that
[SPEAKER_12]: came out it seems like there was some
potential there but I think that from
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at the landscape before we can
really start you know diving into that we
[SPEAKER_12]: need to make sure that it's going to be
consumer accepted mushrooms are already
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of you know people feel a certain way
about them compared to like plants so you
[SPEAKER_12]: know we don't want to like you know shake
the boat too much about that so yeah I
[SPEAKER_12]: agree I think it would be really exciting
if we if we could be able to use some of
[SPEAKER_12]: those tools so the question was how can we
improve shelf life of mushrooms so in
[SPEAKER_12]: terms of thinking of post harvest factors
having a strong supply chain is one way
[SPEAKER_12]: you can do it you can control the
environment making sure that you slow down
[SPEAKER_12]: the mushroom biology with cool
temperatures you can manage the humidity
[SPEAKER_12]: and that has stuff to do with like the
shipping and the packaging aspect the
[SPEAKER_12]: genetic side of things we can also kind of
modify that where we want to breed
[SPEAKER_12]: mushrooms that have that keep their gills
closed they have their caps and they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: open up and mature so they like they get
all nasty and spores and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_12]: there is genetic variation for that and so
that's like it's an important breeding
[SPEAKER_13]: target that we're looking at next I would
like to introduce Dr. Sara Gonzalez she's
[SPEAKER_13]: a marine ecologist and evolutionary
biologist specialized in seaweed research
[SPEAKER_13]: and particularly focusing on seaweed
ecology physiology and chemistry for
[SPEAKER_13]: sustainable aqua culture development and
climate mitigation an alumni of Cornell
[SPEAKER_13]: and PhD from UC Santa Cruz she is a
postdoctoral scholar at Woods Hole
[SPEAKER_13]: Oceanographic Institution her work centers
on identifying heat tolerance strains of
[SPEAKER_13]: sugar kelp and using satellite remote
sensing to access kelp forest health much
[SPEAKER_13]: like the wonderful person she is and
she'll be presenting her wonderful talk on
[SPEAKER_13]: not your typical crop growing resilient
seaweed for a warming ocean thank you
[SPEAKER_06]: thank you for that wonderful introduction
and thank you all for being here and a big
[SPEAKER_06]: thank you to the organizing committee for
all your hard work putting on this awesome
[SPEAKER_06]: symposium I'm excited to continue the
theme of not plants talking about some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the work I've been leading as a postdoc at
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution over
[SPEAKER_06]: the last year and a half or so where we
are growing resilient seaweed for a
[SPEAKER_06]: warming ocean so I did do my undergraduate
degree here at Cornell but at the time I
[SPEAKER_06]: was really mostly interested in animals
and behavior and physiology so probably
[SPEAKER_06]: the most planned related thing I did was
in my art of horticulture class I helped
[SPEAKER_06]: to build this sod sofa which still exists
next to Trillium and I was really excited
[SPEAKER_06]: to get started in research as an
undergraduate I worked with shrimp
[SPEAKER_06]: parasites in the Chesapeake Bay and spent
a summer at Shoals Marine Lab which is
[SPEAKER_06]: co-run by Cornell and University of New
Hampshire studying herring gull chick
[SPEAKER_06]: development and growth while avoiding
being dive bombs in the head by their
[SPEAKER_06]: parents but my world really opened up when
I got the chance to experience seaweed for
[SPEAKER_06]: the first time when I did a Fulbright
fellowship in Chile and my research there
[SPEAKER_06]: was centered around kelp forest ecology
and also kelp harvesting strategies and
[SPEAKER_06]: impacts of harvesting different harvesting
strategies on the recruitment of
[SPEAKER_06]: invertebrates in the kelp forest so I got
the chance to travel around the country
[SPEAKER_06]: and speak to fishermen and kelp harvesters
who were harvesting this resource and I
[SPEAKER_06]: was just really impressed by not only the
ecological importance of kelp for
[SPEAKER_06]: providing this foundational habitat for
lots of fish and invertebrates but also
[SPEAKER_06]: the importance that kelp has in human
societies anywhere on the central coast of
[SPEAKER_06]: Chile you could find kelp being sold in
dried bundles at fish markets so I was
[SPEAKER_06]: really excited to continue studying kelp
for my dissertation work at UC Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_06]: and in particular I was fascinated by the
morphology of giant kelp which was in that
[SPEAKER_06]: last image as well and how it exists in
these two different forms that if you dive
[SPEAKER_06]: down below to the holdfast this structure
that holds the kelp to the rocks at the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom sometimes the giant kelp would have
this kind of conical mounding holdfast and
[SPEAKER_06]: other times it would have this elongated
flattened stretched out looking holdfast
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was just so curious as to how this
could be is this an environmentally
[SPEAKER_06]: plastic trait or is this something
genetically fixed and so I gathered spores
[SPEAKER_06]: from both morphs and brought them into the
lab and grew them on these tiny pieces of
[SPEAKER_06]: string and so they started out just a
couple centimeters large planted them into
[SPEAKER_06]: the bottom of the ocean and six months
later they had grown to be over nine
[SPEAKER_06]: meters tall and I was able to compare
their morphologies and see whether this
[SPEAKER_06]: trait was actually genetically fixed or
not it's genetic by the way and it turned
[SPEAKER_06]: out that a lot of these methods I was
using happened to be borrowed from kelp
[SPEAKER_06]: aquaculture this seeding the kelp onto
strings so that transitioned nicely to my
[SPEAKER_06]: current work as a postdoc and also the
same motivation for wanting to understand
[SPEAKER_06]: the relationships between genotypes and
phenotypes in kelp but I want to back up
[SPEAKER_06]: and just talk about what is seaweed so
kelp is a type of seaweed but here we can
[SPEAKER_06]: see that the seaweeds are really diverse
group of species they come in all sorts of
[SPEAKER_06]: colors and textures and sizes and they are
categorized as large multicellular marine
[SPEAKER_06]: algae and they are photosynthetic but
unlike plants they don't have any roots or
[SPEAKER_06]: vascular systems and we group them as reds
greens and browns based on the predominant
[SPEAKER_06]: color pigments that they have and some
examples would be nori you might be
[SPEAKER_06]: familiar with is often found in sushi
rolls green seaweed example would be sea
[SPEAKER_06]: lettuce and then the brown seaweeds are
wakame kombu and other kelp which you
[SPEAKER_06]: might have had in seaweed salad or in miso
soup so this is seaweed but this is also
[SPEAKER_06]: seaweed we experience seaweed in a lot of
daily products maybe we're not always
[SPEAKER_06]: aware of but there are a lot of sugar
extracts that we can take from seaweed
[SPEAKER_06]: that have a gelling or emulsifying or
thickening agent to them we find them in
[SPEAKER_06]: heartburn relief medication toothpaste
salad dressings mac and cheese and then in
[SPEAKER_06]: recent years there's also been a lot of
development in food products that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: don't hide the seaweed as much so in many
countries especially in Asia seaweed has
[SPEAKER_06]: been a part of the diet for thousands of
years but in countries like the US it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not as prominent in our diets so there's
been efforts to sort of mainstream kelp
[SPEAKER_06]: into things we're more familiar with like
burgers and then also using seaweed
[SPEAKER_06]: extracts to make novel materials like
bioplastics or fibers that can replace
[SPEAKER_06]: synthetic fibers and maybe start to
replace the more carbon-heavy industries
[SPEAKER_06]: and see which is also really sustainable
in terms of its relative resource use per
[SPEAKER_06]: ton of edible protein so in this figure
here we're probably all aware that beef is
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty resource intensive in terms of land
water feed and greenhouse gas emissions
[SPEAKER_06]: followed by pork and then poultry when you
get into seafood is a little more
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainable fish and shellfish but seaweed
is really the only crop that has the
[SPEAKER_06]: potential to be carbon neutral or even
carbon negative since it is taking up CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: as it's growing and it doesn't require any
fresh water or fertilizer or arable land
[SPEAKER_06]: in order to grow but okay we're not gonna
all just eat seaweed we still have other
[SPEAKER_06]: forms of agriculture and that's okay
seaweed can also help reduce greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: gas emissions in other forms of
agriculture cows we all know emit methane
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's actually a type of red seaweed
that if you include in the cow's diet due
[SPEAKER_06]: to the high brome form content of the
seaweed actually can reduce the methane
[SPEAKER_06]: output of cows by 60 to 80 percent in
addition we can just use seaweed as animal
[SPEAKER_06]: feed to have a lower carbon footprint than
some of these other more common crops used
[SPEAKER_06]: for feed like corn and soybean and if we
can figure out how to grow seaweed at
[SPEAKER_06]: really large scales we can start to tackle
some larger issues like carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_06]: sequestration so as the kelp is growing
it's taking up CO2 like any other
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthesizing organism and then
sometimes those kelp fronds may get
[SPEAKER_06]: detached say during a storm or bits of
detritus are just fluffing off all the
[SPEAKER_06]: time and that material eventually makes
its way down into the deep ocean where
[SPEAKER_06]: there's really not a lot of metabolic
activity going on so that carbon just sits
[SPEAKER_06]: there and degrades very slowly and is
essentially sequestered for potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of years so there's some thoughts
out there that maybe we could farm a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of seaweed suck out a bunch of CO2
from the atmosphere and then dump it to
[SPEAKER_06]: the bottom of the ocean just to give you a
sense of the kind of scale that we would
[SPEAKER_06]: need to have a really sizable impact on
CO2 sequestration to sequester one gigaton
[SPEAKER_06]: of carbon per year we would need about
seven hundred thirty thousand square
[SPEAKER_06]: kilometers of seaweed right now the total
area of all the world's seaweed farms
[SPEAKER_06]: amounts to just two thousand square
kilometers so we really need quite a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of seaweed and then there's also the
question of what to do with this seaweed
[SPEAKER_06]: to sequester the carbon there's some
potential concerns about sinking this huge
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of biomass to the bottom of the
ocean what are the ecological effects of
[SPEAKER_06]: doing that where there's not normally this
huge influx of carbon all at once and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: also kind of awaits because we farm all
this seaweed we could turn it into
[SPEAKER_06]: something like construction bricks for
buildings that could maybe hold that
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon in buildings that are going to last
for a long time so where does seaweed
[SPEAKER_06]: farming occur around the world over 95
percent of seaweed farming is happening in
[SPEAKER_06]: Asia primarily China and Indonesia but
there's also a lot of other countries with
[SPEAKER_06]: high exclusive economic zones shirt the
bright blue color there including the US
[SPEAKER_06]: so there's plenty of more ocean space
where we could potentially be expanding
[SPEAKER_06]: seaweed and seaweed farming is actually
the fastest growing sector of aquaculture
[SPEAKER_06]: and it can look different in different
places around the world depending on the
[SPEAKER_06]: species resources so sometimes you might
have red seaweed growing kind of in
[SPEAKER_06]: shallow near-shore waters here you might
have really large-scale red seaweed farms
[SPEAKER_06]: some smaller scale ones in Faroe Islands
and in Maine and in the US the major
[SPEAKER_06]: states involved in kelp farming are Maine
and Alaska and this species here the sugar
[SPEAKER_06]: kelp is the most commonly farmed species
and is going to be the star of the rest of
[SPEAKER_06]: the talk today so a lot of great products
can be derived from sugar kelp again with
[SPEAKER_06]: those sugar extracts for example alginate
depending on the particular species and
[SPEAKER_06]: actually where the kelp is grown you get
different compositions of these sugars and
[SPEAKER_06]: that can lead to either more rigid or more
elastic gels that can be used in different
[SPEAKER_06]: products like pharmaceuticals the kelp can
just be eaten straight as food might want
[SPEAKER_06]: to boil it down a bit so it's not so chewy
and then supplements like iodine really
[SPEAKER_06]: popular coming from kelp biomedical
materials like wound dressings and dental
[SPEAKER_06]: molds and then again as a gel or thickener
for cosmetics and food and because of its
[SPEAKER_06]: high nitrogen content can also be a really
great fertilizer and even potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: extracting biofuel sugar kelp gets its
name actually from the high content of the
[SPEAKER_06]: sugar alcohol called mannitol which can be
converted into biofuels and we really do
[SPEAKER_06]: need a lot of innovative products to help
mitigate effects of climate change if you
[SPEAKER_06]: were on earth last year you experienced
the warmest year in recorded history and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's probably going to change at the end
of this year this is a map of the global
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature anomalies from last summer and
overlaying here the sugar kelp wild
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution happens to be in a lot of
these hot spots that are warming up pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: rapidly especially and the northeast u.s.
[SPEAKER_06]: where we have a lot of our wild sugar kelp
populations so sugar kelp is a cold loving
[SPEAKER_06]: temperate species they really start to
degrade above temperatures of 20 21
[SPEAKER_06]: degrees celsius so warming waters are
threatening sugar cup aquaculture it's
[SPEAKER_06]: increasing the vulnerability of those wild
populations which are the seed source
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially for our farmed kelp it also
shortens the growing season for for
[SPEAKER_06]: growing kelp it limits the time that you
can plant the kelp because you may have to
[SPEAKER_06]: start waiting later into the fall where
it's cold enough to plant and you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: start harvesting earlier in the spring
before it gets too warm again so this is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to result in lower yields and then
warming also is restricting the latitudes
[SPEAKER_06]: where we can actually farm kelp luckily
there is substantial genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_06]: among our sugar kelp populations and so
our lab at Woods Hole works primarily with
[SPEAKER_06]: these northeast eastern populations from
Maine down to New York and so since
[SPEAKER_06]: there's this genetic diversity it's likely
that there are already some individuals
[SPEAKER_06]: out there that have adaptations to cope
with heat and so in this figure the
[SPEAKER_06]: different colors represent different
ancestry groupings and each horizontal bar
[SPEAKER_06]: represents a different individual in these
different populations so if we can
[SPEAKER_06]: identify the individuals that have these
adaptations to cope with heat and look at
[SPEAKER_06]: the genes involved then we can really
start breeding for heat tolerant kelp so
[SPEAKER_06]: before I get into how we do the breeding
we talked about the life cycle I'm glad
[SPEAKER_06]: we've already been talking about spores
and such that's going to be helpful so
[SPEAKER_06]: what we do in our lab to to grow to breed
the kelp is we'll collect the adult
[SPEAKER_06]: sporophyte which is what we see growing
out in the wild and then usually running
[SPEAKER_06]: down the center of the sporophyte is kind
of like a darkened band and that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: sorus tissue that's where all the spores
are kept so we can bring that back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: lab and pretty easily just release the
spores cut out a little piece of the sorus
[SPEAKER_06]: that's enough stress to make it want to
release all its spores and then the
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophyte is the next life stage that
grows out of the spores we have male and
[SPEAKER_06]: female gametophyte that which can come
from a single sporophyte and then under
[SPEAKER_06]: the right conditions those were released
their gametes and fertilized egg which
[SPEAKER_06]: then developed into the juvenile
sporophyte and ultimately the adult
[SPEAKER_06]: sporophyte so in order to do breeding in
the lab we start by isolating a single
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophyte put in a flask of seawater
over time it grows into this kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: pom-pom and then we're able to fractionate
that up into little fragments and
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually those grow we fractionate more
and we end up with all this biomass of
[SPEAKER_06]: fragments all of the same genotype so in
our lab at Woods Hole we have a collection
[SPEAKER_06]: of hundreds of these strains all
originated from single gametophytes so
[SPEAKER_06]: when we want to do a cross we can just
take a scoop of this male gametophyte a
[SPEAKER_06]: scoop of that female gametophyte throw
them together and they produce sporophyte
[SPEAKER_06]: so that process in a bit more detail once
we have thrown the gametophytes together
[SPEAKER_06]: and they have little microscopic
beginnings of sporophytes we actually
[SPEAKER_06]: filter that material down and then take a
paintbrush calligraphy brush and paint
[SPEAKER_06]: that on to the spools of string then once
those have a little more time to grow in
[SPEAKER_06]: the lab we bring them out into the ocean
where we wrap them around a larger thicker
[SPEAKER_06]: grow line and so the kelp lines are just
sitting out about six feet below the
[SPEAKER_06]: surface of the water and then we deploy
them in autumn and then about six months
[SPEAKER_06]: later in spring we harvest the kelp up
onto a boat and quite heavy so we need
[SPEAKER_06]: some extra equipment to haul that on to
land and then we come back to the lab and
[SPEAKER_06]: we take a bunch of measurements to see
which genotypes led to which kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotypes and we do see a pretty wide
variety in yield in length of blades in
[SPEAKER_06]: density of blades all just from crossing
different gametophytes and these were all
[SPEAKER_06]: grown within the same farm a pretty small
area about 400 square meters so we do see
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a bit of diversity so mostly the lab
has been working on breeding for high
[SPEAKER_06]: yield kelp but we're also interested in
breeding for other traits like heat
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance so our goal is to really breed
more heat tolerant kelp to increase
[SPEAKER_06]: resiliency in the industry to expand
farming to lower latitudes and extend the
[SPEAKER_06]: growing season for kelp where it's already
being grown so the way we've gone about
[SPEAKER_06]: doing this is to start with the
gametophyte stage so we have our big
[SPEAKER_06]: collection of gametophytes we first want
to assess heat stress tolerance in these
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophytes then the idea is to cross
from that heat stress experiment identify
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophytes that we think are heat
tolerant and ones that we think are not
[SPEAKER_06]: heat tolerant and make crosses within each
of those groups and then grow them up into
[SPEAKER_06]: sporophytes and see whether our
predictions of the gametophyte stage hold
[SPEAKER_06]: true at the sporophyte stage because
ultimately what we're interested in is
[SPEAKER_06]: whether the sporophyte are heat tolerant
but if we can predict that sporophyte heat
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance from the gametophyte stage
that's going to really help advance us in
[SPEAKER_06]: our breeding process so I'll start by
talking about the gametophyte heat stress
[SPEAKER_06]: testing so we conducted this experiment in
little tabletop incubators putting the
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophytes in these 96 well plates and I
had three temperature treatments in three
[SPEAKER_06]: different incubators so the first is the
12 degrees Celsius that's their control
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions that's where they're happiest
and then 20 degrees and 24 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: represent current anomaly temperatures and
future expected temperatures for the Gulf
[SPEAKER_06]: of Maine region where most of these
gametophytes originated from so in each
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature we had 93 genetically distinct
gametophytes that we plated out with three
[SPEAKER_06]: replicates into each of the wells in the
96 well plate and this is an example of
[SPEAKER_06]: what it would look like inside one of
those wells a bunch of little fragments
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the same genotype so we ran this
experiment over a few weeks and what we
[SPEAKER_06]: were measuring was photosystem functioning
via chlorophyll A fluorescence so probably
[SPEAKER_06]: folks here are familiar with chlorophyll A
that mostly absorbs around 684 nanometers
[SPEAKER_06]: wavelength so we used a plate reading
spectrofluorometer to put our 96 well
[SPEAKER_06]: plates into there and measured the change
in fluorescence of each well over time so
[SPEAKER_06]: if we have a really healthy set of
gametophyte fragments that are all
[SPEAKER_06]: fluorescing and we see high fluorescence
intensity we know that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: live cells there if we see very low
fluorescence intensity we know that there
[SPEAKER_06]: are very few live cells in that well so
this is how we kind of tracked survival
[SPEAKER_06]: and health of the gametophytes over time
so let's see what happened with their
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthetic performance we started all
the incubators at 12 degrees Celsius
[SPEAKER_06]: gradually ramped them up to their final
temperatures and then held them at those
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures for two weeks so the y-axis
there is the mean fluorescence intensity
[SPEAKER_06]: and these are averages for all 93
gametophytes in each treatment and we see
[SPEAKER_06]: that in the control there was maybe a
little bit of decline in fluorescence
[SPEAKER_06]: intensity they probably didn't love living
in a 96 well plate we saw a much greater
[SPEAKER_06]: decline in the 20 C and especially the 24
C treatment so the heat was definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: having a negative effect on survival of
the gametophytes but there was actually
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a lot of individual variation so if
we look now at the change in fluorescence
[SPEAKER_06]: from the beginning to the end of the
two-week heat treatment we're looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: the percent change in fluorescence over
that time for each individual gametophyte
[SPEAKER_06]: and again they had three replicates so we
can see that we span from some
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophytes that declined almost a
hundred percent so basically fully dead
[SPEAKER_06]: and others that declined zero or even had
a positive increase in fluorescence so
[SPEAKER_06]: we're really seeing a wide array of heat
tolerances here and we had thought that
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe since we collect from these two
different regions Gulf of Maine and
[SPEAKER_06]: southern New England there's previous
research shows genetic genetic break here
[SPEAKER_06]: so we thought that maybe the southern New
England help would have already some more
[SPEAKER_06]: heat tolerance adaptations since they
maybe experienced warmer temperatures than
[SPEAKER_06]: Gulf of Maine but interestingly we didn't
see any difference in the percent change
[SPEAKER_06]: in fluorescence between these two groups
so really came down to just a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: individual variation and we were able to
do a preliminary genome-wide association
[SPEAKER_06]: study based on that variation we had over
900,000 SNPs which are here on the x-axis
[SPEAKER_06]: we have scaffolds not chromosomes which is
why this axis looks kind of crazy and then
[SPEAKER_06]: the y-axis is the relationship or the
significance of the relationship between
[SPEAKER_06]: each of those loci and the heat stress
response so we have not a ton of super
[SPEAKER_06]: significant SNPs but we do see a couple
peaks here where there are a lot of SNPs
[SPEAKER_06]: all in the same general region so maybe
this would be an area that we want to
[SPEAKER_06]: investigate further to see if there are
any genes maybe coding for proteins that
[SPEAKER_06]: could be related for heat tolerance we're
currently working on that right now okay
[SPEAKER_06]: so I want to talk about the next stage in
this process so we assessed heat stress
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance in the gametophytes now we're
going to see how did our predictions go
[SPEAKER_06]: and are they related to the sporophyte
stage well it would be really nice to test
[SPEAKER_06]: this on adult sporophytes since we didn't
want to wait that long we used juvenile
[SPEAKER_06]: sporophytes but we actually did also plant
these crosses out to the ocean and we'll
[SPEAKER_06]: be harvesting them in a couple of months
so we'll be able to look at juvenile to
[SPEAKER_06]: adult sporophyte relationship as well okay
so taking what we learned from the
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophyte heat stress response we wanted
to grab males and females from the top
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerant and the lower less tolerant and
so we made five crosses that we predicted
[SPEAKER_06]: would be tolerant and five that we
predicted would be intolerant but
[SPEAKER_06]: interestingly kind of similar to the
mushroom sometimes certain gametophytes
[SPEAKER_06]: just aren't compatible and so we ended up
with were three tolerant crosses that
[SPEAKER_06]: produce sporophytes and four intolerant
crosses that produce sporophytes so how we
[SPEAKER_06]: did this was again taking that material
painting it on two strings which we've
[SPEAKER_06]: wrapped around microscope slides here and
then gave them about four to five weeks to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow when the sporophytes were about a
centimeter large we plucked them off from
[SPEAKER_06]: each cross and put each one into a test
tube and then we had an experiment in
[SPEAKER_06]: these incubators here so the juvenile
sporophytes were all in test tubes and we
[SPEAKER_06]: had two incubators at two different
treatments one again control at 12 and a
[SPEAKER_06]: heat treatment that was gradually warming
up to 22 degrees Celsius we wanted to be
[SPEAKER_06]: sure to do a gradual warming so as not to
heat shock the sporophytes and have them
[SPEAKER_06]: just all die because we do want to see
which ones are tolerant and which are not
[SPEAKER_06]: so in each treatment we had our seven
crosses three tolerant four intolerant and
[SPEAKER_06]: six replicate blades or six test tubes for
each cross and then in order to analyze
[SPEAKER_06]: how these sporophytes were either
tolerating or not tolerating the heat we
[SPEAKER_06]: took photos at three different time points
so first at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_06]: experiment then about two weeks in when
the heat treatment had reached 20 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: and then about three weeks in when the
heat treatment had reached 22 degrees and
[SPEAKER_06]: the main metrics we were looking at were
the total area and then also the healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: area which was calculated from the percent
healthy tissue so we took these images and
[SPEAKER_06]: analyzed them in image J to get the total
area and then we created an algorithm that
[SPEAKER_06]: would characterize each pixel in the blade
as either healthy or degraded based on how
[SPEAKER_06]: much blue light was being absorbed or not
so these images were taken over a backlit
[SPEAKER_06]: surface and we said that if more than 50%
of the blue light was coming through that
[SPEAKER_06]: means there wasn't a lot of chlorophyll
there so that's a degraded tissue area if
[SPEAKER_06]: less than 50% of the blue light was coming
through and was being absorbed then we
[SPEAKER_06]: know that was healthy tissue so for
example algorithm told us this blade was
[SPEAKER_06]: 97% healthy and this blade was 36% healthy
and from there we just multiply by total
[SPEAKER_06]: area to get the healthy area so let's take
a look first at individual cross variation
[SPEAKER_06]: for total area so we can see that in the
heat treatment most of the growth was
[SPEAKER_06]: happening over this first time period and
then they were sort of just maintaining
[SPEAKER_06]: the area that they had amassed whereas in
the control treatment we saw more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: steady increase throughout the duration of
the experiment and a kind of similar trend
[SPEAKER_06]: with the healthy tissue although some
individuals in control were also losing a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of healthy tissue in that time
but so really most of the growth and
[SPEAKER_06]: growth of healthy tissue happened in that
first up to 20 degrees and then more just
[SPEAKER_06]: maintenance up to 22 degrees so now let's
see what happens if we group them by their
[SPEAKER_06]: prediction categories so we can clearly
see that the left graph here is the mean
[SPEAKER_06]: percent change in total area from the
beginning to the 20C mark we see that the
[SPEAKER_06]: predicted tolerant groups for the darker
bars had a much greater percent change in
[SPEAKER_06]: area compared to the predicted intolerant
group and a similar story for percent
[SPEAKER_06]: change of healthy area we see that the
predicted tolerant group had amassed more
[SPEAKER_06]: healthy area than the intolerant group and
importantly we see that there's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between the two groups in the
control treatment so this means that our
[SPEAKER_06]: predicted tolerant group was able to grow
more and more healthy tissue in heat
[SPEAKER_06]: without compromising their growth in cold
conditions and this is important because
[SPEAKER_06]: on the farm it starts out cold and gets
warmer so you want the kelp to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow well in all of these conditions now
when we get up to 22C we see the tolerant
[SPEAKER_06]: group is still maintaining more area than
the intolerant group but it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily healthier there's no longer a
significant difference there although we
[SPEAKER_06]: did have kind of a small sample size so
possibly with more samples that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: significant but it's possible also that
this tolerance just didn't hold up to 22
[SPEAKER_06]: which is really quite stressful for the
kelp so what we've learned so far is that
[SPEAKER_06]: our gametophytes display a wide range in
heat tolerances even from just this
[SPEAKER_06]: relatively small area from Maine to New
York we've collected from and just looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at 93 gametophytes so this is really
promising that we have a lot of variation
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to select on and we know that
the sporophyte progeny of our predicted
[SPEAKER_06]: heat tolerant gametophytes did grow bigger
and healthier than the predicted
[SPEAKER_06]: intolerant sporophytes at least up to 20C
so this is really key and this is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the first studies that's really relating
gametophyte phenotypes in kelp to
[SPEAKER_06]: sporophyte phenotypes so making that
connection is going to be really important
[SPEAKER_06]: moving forward for heat tolerance or other
traits too looking at alginate sugar
[SPEAKER_06]: content mannitol other desirable traits
for aquaculture and we're even able to see
[SPEAKER_06]: that there may be some specific regions of
the genome that could be related to heat
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance so we're currently conducting
another study another round of 90
[SPEAKER_06]: gametophytes to add data to this set so we
can have a more robust genome-wide
[SPEAKER_06]: association study and maybe see what those
gene regions may be doing so I think we've
[SPEAKER_06]: made a few steps closer to our goal of
producing heat tolerant kelp to increase
[SPEAKER_06]: crop reliability extend the growing season
and expand kelp farming to warmer
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes but of course always more work
to be done and I want to really thank
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone who contributed to this study
folks in Scott Lindell's lab at HUI as
[SPEAKER_06]: well as our collaborators including
Jean-Luc who's here in the audience and
[SPEAKER_06]: all of our funding sources and thank you
all again for being here I'm happy to take
[SPEAKER_06]: any questions yeah that's a really great
question the regulations around that vary
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot by state in the US so for example in
Alaska they have a rule that all the kelp
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're growing has to be sourced from
kelp with within 50 kilometers of your
[SPEAKER_06]: farm and represent at least 50 unique
genetically unique individuals to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: preserve that diversity and Maine also has
strict rules about if you're you've taken
[SPEAKER_06]: kelp out of Maine into the lab it can't be
planted back in Maine then some other
[SPEAKER_06]: states that haven't had kelp naturally
growing in a while have a bit more lax
[SPEAKER_06]: policies because I guess they figure well
kelp grows they're not going to interfere
[SPEAKER_06]: with the existing population because there
really isn't an existing population so it
[SPEAKER_06]: does depend a lot regulation wise by state
but I think biologically we still need to
[SPEAKER_06]: do more research particularly each
individual species to understand what kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of is the probability of interfering with
the local population how much diversity do
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to ensure that you won't have
single genotypes kind of taking over I
[SPEAKER_06]: think a lot of that research still needs
to be done but definitely a concern on
[SPEAKER_06]: regulators minds oh great question so we
keep the gametophytes under red light to
[SPEAKER_06]: keep them in a vegetative state so that
prevents them from becoming fertile until
[SPEAKER_06]: we're ready to cross them and do fertility
yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly so the first question was the
first question again how do you ocean
[SPEAKER_06]: space right so in our lab we mostly work
on just pilot scale farms so really small
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're mostly in coordination with
either existing kelp companies that want
[SPEAKER_06]: to that have leased the space and they
want to test out certain farm designs or
[SPEAKER_06]: see how different strains work and so
we've made partnerships with companies to
[SPEAKER_06]: use their space or universities have that
we can work with and we get permits for
[SPEAKER_06]: just these small scale farms but yeah
there's certainly there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_06]: ocean users particularly in the nearshore
areas fishermen shellfishers although
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes we also do work with shellfish
farms and there's some work also trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: integrate growing seaweed next to
shellfish for kind of mutual benefits
[SPEAKER_06]: there so at larger scales there certainly
could be impacts of shading so I think it
[SPEAKER_06]: would be important to choose areas that
maybe like have sandy bottom where you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have a lot of things growing there
anyway or maybe do kind of smaller patches
[SPEAKER_06]: of farms leaving spaces for light in
between there's lots of study on
[SPEAKER_06]: engineering and design of these farms to
be able to accommodate existing sea life
[SPEAKER_06]: oh interesting yeah so we we did look at
some in a separate study I didn't mention
[SPEAKER_06]: here with adult sporophytes looked at
interaction of heat and nitrogen content
[SPEAKER_06]: because there's been some studies that
show that with increased nitrogen maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: the kelp is able to sort of overcome more
heat conditions we didn't actually find
[SPEAKER_06]: that was the case and so there and there's
been other work that shows other species
[SPEAKER_06]: that that isn't always the case so I think
it is really region and species dependent
[SPEAKER_06]: whether the extra nitrogen it's helpful as
far as acidification generally more co2
[SPEAKER_06]: the kelp kind of like but there could be
indirect impacts by impacting other life
[SPEAKER_06]: around them that may have some other
factors no we haven't we definitely see
[SPEAKER_06]: that as on the farms as it gets closer to
summer there's a lot more fouling on the
[SPEAKER_06]: kelp so there probably is a relationship
there which as things are warming up those
[SPEAKER_06]: organisms become more abundant in the
ocean perhaps so there probably is also
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship with other disease I was not
looked into that okay um I don't know if
[SPEAKER_06]: we can offer no yeah I don't think we have
really any ideas what's going on it seems
[SPEAKER_06]: really really random at this point do you
have you find any particular yeah yes I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean I guess because you know normally in
nature an individual sporophyte has like
[SPEAKER_06]: millions of spores so if one doesn't work
with one other one it doesn't matter for
[SPEAKER_06]: the reproductive success of that
sporophyte yeah interestingly we didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: see any correlation between heat tolerance
and the populations that these were
[SPEAKER_06]: sourced from so we did look by region and
then also by population and there there
[SPEAKER_06]: were what's into correlation there so it's
really amazing how much diversity we saw
[SPEAKER_06]: within populations and then sometimes
within a single sporophyte so sometimes we
[SPEAKER_06]: had essentially sibling gametophytes that
were sourced from the same sporophyte that
[SPEAKER_06]: would sometimes also have different heat
tolerances but also important to note
[SPEAKER_06]: these gametophytes that I was testing they
were originally sourced from sporophytes
[SPEAKER_06]: collected back in 2018 and they've been in
a cold chamber storage basically for five
[SPEAKER_06]: six years so it's possible that through
cell division in the cold chamber they've
[SPEAKER_09]: reacclimated to all kind of be at the same
baseline maybe okay oh dominance of
[SPEAKER_06]: certain yeah sorry I don't think I totally
understood the
[SPEAKER_06]: question so the gametophytes are actually
a free-living life stage so once the
[SPEAKER_06]: spores get released they develop into the
gametophytes and the males and females are
[SPEAKER_06]: separate organisms essentially at that
point and then the female will grow an egg
[SPEAKER_06]: this male will fertilize and at that point
in this the sporophyte grows from the egg
[SPEAKER_06]: was that your question it's diploid at
that point yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: we did have we had representation
representation from about 11 of those 15
[SPEAKER_06]: populations I showed so pretty good
representation along all of the groups
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah didn't look specifically that was
just yeah didn't look specifically at
[SPEAKER_06]: ancestry from the two regions that was
from the gametophyte no no no those were
[SPEAKER_06]: from our gametophyte collections so they
were collected from wild sporophytes but
[SPEAKER_06]: when I showed the two regions that were
not different that was based on the the
[SPEAKER_06]: heat tolerance assessment of the 93
gametophytes from our germplasm that have
[SPEAKER_06]: been harvested and cultivated essentially
in vegetative form
[SPEAKER_06]: probably not the help adults can last more
than a year though not typically but there
[SPEAKER_06]: is some research showing that the
gametophytes can actually kind of stay
[SPEAKER_06]: dormant in the sediment I guess in case
conditions are too warm or otherwise not
[SPEAKER_06]: favorable and then become fertile when
conditions are better again but I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's years I think that's more like
on a month time scale yeah so it is kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of unnatural the way we're keeping them
for sure yes question back there or no
[SPEAKER_06]: okay yes helps without sugar I don't think
so no I think they've all got either some
[SPEAKER_06]: form of alginate or agar and the red sea
we test carrageenan yeah but the sugar
[SPEAKER_06]: kelp just has more I guess than other kelp
species yeah I don't know I don't know if
[SPEAKER_06]: we have that but I mean it's not like
glucose sugar you know it's different form
[SPEAKER_06]: of polysaccharide so it doesn't really
taste sweet yeah that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: point so at least in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_06]: right now the structure of farming
particularly on the eastern coast is that
[SPEAKER_06]: there are few kelp hatcheries that have
the kelp seed gametophytes basically and
[SPEAKER_06]: then farmers can buy seed from there so I
guess the the heat tolerance breeding or
[SPEAKER_06]: any sort of breeding would really happen
in those hatcheries this could potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: be farmers who want to breed their own but
typically they're buying from larger
[SPEAKER_06]: hatcheries and so the idea is that maybe
if we can identify genes related to heat
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance it'll be easier for hatcheries
to sort of screen their collections to see
[SPEAKER_06]: if they can find individuals with those
traits we have our final speaker for the
[SPEAKER_03]: symposium kevin folta is a professor of
horticulture sciences at the university of
[SPEAKER_03]: florida where he researches
photomorphogenesis controlled environment
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture the genetic basis of flavor
and fruits and the control of flowering
[SPEAKER_04]: dr. folta is also an experienced science
communicator and has hosted the talking
[SPEAKER_04]: biotech podcast since 2014 he's been
recognized with the nsf career award and
[SPEAKER_04]: the cast borlaug award in agricultural
communication today he will highlight work
[SPEAKER_04]: on breeding crops for controlled
environments in his talk titled
[SPEAKER_04]: controlling e controlling g new crops for
controlled environments thank you kevin
[SPEAKER_10]: well i guess i have to start out by
admitting i've got organism envy you got
[SPEAKER_10]: like jafa mellow and mellow and hairy
vetch and sugar help and mushrooms and i
[SPEAKER_10]: got lettuce but but but i do weird stuff
to it and that's kind of the take-home
[SPEAKER_10]: message is yeah in thinking about the
presentation today which is most
[SPEAKER_10]: appropriate for perhaps a younger audience
for a student organized consortium is when
[SPEAKER_10]: i was in your shoes i was thinking you
know everything's pretty much figured out
[SPEAKER_10]: already what am i going to do and i think
what happens is you start to find funny
[SPEAKER_10]: avenues of research to open up the more
you think about ways that we can think of
[SPEAKER_10]: useful application and also new ways to
solve old problems and i'll be the first
[SPEAKER_10]: to admit i'm not smart as most of the
people i work with but i'm clever and i
[SPEAKER_10]: work hard and i think you'll see that's
kind of the theme here there's different
[SPEAKER_10]: ways you can solve a problem and uh and
come up with new new technology and i
[SPEAKER_10]: think that's that's what we're going to
cover so today we'll talk about genetics
[SPEAKER_10]: and environment we'll talk about the way
these things work together so my
[SPEAKER_10]: laboratory oops um it does a lot of stuff
we historically have worked with
[SPEAKER_10]: strawberry genomics we were the laboratory
that led the sequencing effort of the
[SPEAKER_10]: diploid strawberry way back in 2010 and it
was the 12th plant genome sequenced with
[SPEAKER_10]: no no physical map and all um all uh short
read assemblies pretty cool stuff back
[SPEAKER_10]: then and then we do some stuff with light
and then uh the best project is how we
[SPEAKER_10]: wreck things uh plants and microbes with
random peptides so we find lethal peptides
[SPEAKER_10]: that kill things that's really kind of
neat and then new crops for florida was
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of born through coven we're
experimenting with ways to grow find new
[SPEAKER_10]: crops that can work really good really
well on small farms and really exploring
[SPEAKER_10]: the universe of novelty to see what we can
do for small farmers to introduce local
[SPEAKER_10]: consumers to things they've never tried
before and things that do very well and it
[SPEAKER_10]: turns out that's actually been really
exciting work mostly because in my when
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm not at work i'm at home at work i got
married to a farmer and she's she was a
[SPEAKER_10]: subsistence farmer in ukraine who came to
the us to my town and and now we we do a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of stuff we grow seasonal fruits and
vegetables we also do turkeys and pigs and
[SPEAKER_10]: chickens and eggs and all we sell at the
farmers market every saturday except i
[SPEAKER_10]: won't be there tomorrow so uh and and then
uh last year at 56 years old i started a
[SPEAKER_10]: new kind of breeding project i got an f1
that's kind of cool um she'll be at the
[SPEAKER_10]: market tomorrow she's the main attraction
so um so i so i get to not only research
[SPEAKER_10]: in fruits and vegetables and uh and and
how to grow them better i also get to do
[SPEAKER_10]: it and expose consumers to things they've
never tried before and it's really
[SPEAKER_10]: exciting it's a lot of fun to be able to
do both both things so um what we'll talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about today is how we can think about g
and e in creative ways so one of the big
[SPEAKER_10]: problems with controlled environments and
we get excited about controlled
[SPEAKER_10]: environment companies i think of all the
good things they can do we can repurpose
[SPEAKER_10]: the uh infrastructure in urban areas we
can train an urban workforce for high
[SPEAKER_10]: paying or well okay paying um uh highly
skilled jobs that you can move up in
[SPEAKER_10]: inside a company uh short short um i've
been up for 36 hours so i'm blanking on
[SPEAKER_10]: words um short supply chain you know it
goes right to the consumer down the street
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than across the country low carbon
footprint we get uh water savings all
[SPEAKER_10]: these things are really really really
strong suits of controlled environment
[SPEAKER_10]: agriculture commercially the problem is
the amount of energy that's needed so can
[SPEAKER_10]: we think of clever ways to invent
varieties that will do better inside that
[SPEAKER_10]: controlled environment and can we come up
maybe with new practices new ways to
[SPEAKER_10]: deliver that energy that can make these
things more viable and i've worked with a
[SPEAKER_10]: variety of companies over the years and um
in different capacities um all of them
[SPEAKER_10]: have gone out of business so i didn't do
much for them i guess but but but this
[SPEAKER_10]: just shows how there how there is a need
for thinking about this differently and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what i've always kind of brought to
the table that's kind of why they invited
[SPEAKER_10]: me in i guess the other part of this is
that i've gone to a lot of meetings over
[SPEAKER_10]: the years in controlled environment
agriculture and it really stirred the pot
[SPEAKER_10]: because i've come up with seemed like
radical ideas like just don't grow them
[SPEAKER_10]: under a pink light change the lighting as
plants change through development don't
[SPEAKER_10]: just grow them under light control how
they grow we invented the concept of plant
[SPEAKER_10]: whispering can you give plants a
vocabulary of light signals to control
[SPEAKER_10]: growth and development and and just such
it seemed like such a better idea and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's kind of where we are now and also
the idea that um which seemed kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: silly but was really important what we'll
talk about today is is don't just stick
[SPEAKER_10]: any plant from the field into the box and
expect it to perform just like any
[SPEAKER_10]: environment you have to breed for it and
that's what i'll show you how we are
[SPEAKER_10]: starting to think about that today and we
know that plant growth and development is
[SPEAKER_10]: plant productivity is really a mixture of
genetics environment management and that
[SPEAKER_10]: how those three things align provide us
with some sort of useful commercial plant
[SPEAKER_10]: output and the important message in this
is that you have some certain set of
[SPEAKER_10]: genetics that you can only stretch so far
by changing the environment the genetics
[SPEAKER_10]: are constrained by the environment that
they're in and in the field we can only
[SPEAKER_10]: thing we can control are the genetics and
the management we're at the mercy of the
[SPEAKER_10]: environment which is which is really the
one of the main problems we're at the
[SPEAKER_10]: mercy of the environment okay and then in
a controlled closed environment such as
[SPEAKER_10]: these uh you know operations with
artificial lighting we can control
[SPEAKER_10]: management in the environment and now we
need genetics that fit and that's the
[SPEAKER_10]: argument that that i've always made
because i think with the problem here oops
[SPEAKER_10]: where are we here uh the problem is this
same as this it's like trying to win a dog
[SPEAKER_10]: sled race with dachshunds you've got a
breed that was not made for that
[SPEAKER_10]: environment not performing well in that
environment and you're the guy on the back
[SPEAKER_10]: of the sled saying what's wrong right you
need to have a breed that's made for that
[SPEAKER_10]: environment that likes the cold likes the
snow likes strong likes the like is
[SPEAKER_10]: excited by exertion that kind of thing so
you have to have the right variety for the
[SPEAKER_10]: environment you're using and to a lot of
folks in the controlled environment space
[SPEAKER_10]: this was like an insane idea because a lot
of the this is all dictated by folks who
[SPEAKER_10]: are in the technology and lights and
things like that they forgot that the most
[SPEAKER_10]: complicated machine in that room is the
plant and radically under thought that
[SPEAKER_10]: that part of the equation and so i think
um these ideas we're starting to introduce
[SPEAKER_10]: now so uh so here's the crisis and
opportunity so what are the things that we
[SPEAKER_10]: breed for in the field what are some
important field traits and yield yield
[SPEAKER_08]: okay what else what else what else the
consumer what what else yield all right
[SPEAKER_08]: yield yeah we love that you'll love lots
of it yeah yes uh the timing of flowering
[SPEAKER_10]: right is is it an appropriate plant for
your long days or short days what else we
[SPEAKER_10]: got what was it
[SPEAKER_10]: my ears are ringing from lack of sleep
what was it pathogens and disease these
[SPEAKER_10]: pests and pathogen resistance right and um
and and and maybe some other stuff like
[SPEAKER_10]: you know water resources and other other
there's tons of things that you need
[SPEAKER_10]: shipping you know can i send this from
california to uh ithaca new york and have
[SPEAKER_10]: it still show up in a pretty decent state
right so the priorities for the field are
[SPEAKER_10]: things that benefit the producer not
necessarily the things the consumer wants
[SPEAKER_10]: so if we can control that environment and
have a more locally set set what are some
[SPEAKER_10]: of the things we could breed for flavor
and aroma right what else appearance make
[SPEAKER_10]: them look better make make it so the kids
want to eat their veggies right what else
[SPEAKER_10]: what was it lower inputs right things that
survive on maybe a sprinkle of nutrients
[SPEAKER_10]: that we can control precisely through
hydroponic or other types of means and
[SPEAKER_10]: then uh precise amounts of water which is
becoming an increasingly scarce resource
[SPEAKER_10]: um maybe uh things that don't require
pollination maybe things that are seedless
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe things that um you know still have
good yield um you know you can think of
[SPEAKER_10]: all of these different uh qualities that
would lend themselves very much to uh to
[SPEAKER_10]: growth in a controlled environment and i
give some ideas here because here if we we
[SPEAKER_10]: can control the e it means that we can
play with g and that means we can have a
[SPEAKER_10]: whole set of new priorities and as we are
going through idea field priorities it was
[SPEAKER_10]: yield yield yield right disease resistance
these kinds of things can you ship it uh
[SPEAKER_10]: post-harvest quality but if we can if we
have the opportunity to breed for the
[SPEAKER_10]: specific environment because we can
constrain e now we can look for things
[SPEAKER_10]: that maybe grow rapidly get out of the box
fast get something that has that lends to
[SPEAKER_10]: fewer inputs uh reduce plant stature ease
of harvest high crop value um use of less
[SPEAKER_10]: energy we'll get to that but then novel
flavors and colors uh when you induce the
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers can we flip a switch and turn make
the plant flower think of how much money
[SPEAKER_10]: that would save for the cut flower
industry of being able to stop flower
[SPEAKER_10]: things like basil lettuce shut it down um
manipulate manipulate nutraceutical value
[SPEAKER_10]: um not need pollinators we don't have the
same disease pressure it may be different
[SPEAKER_10]: or maybe none at all some of the new
places are growing plants for medicinal
[SPEAKER_10]: production i do this in clean rooms with
absolutely no pest pressure do this in
[SPEAKER_10]: spacesuits and all that good stuff and one
of my favorites is plasticity multiple
[SPEAKER_10]: phenotypes from one genotype can we flip
the switch and produce a slightly
[SPEAKER_10]: different product and i'll show you some
evidence of that later pretty cool stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: it all boils down to this idea is that
when you're breeding for the field plant
[SPEAKER_10]: breeders want a plant a an exception
optional cultivar is one that is always
[SPEAKER_10]: good no matter what happens in the
environment because you're going to have
[SPEAKER_10]: cloudy days and rainy days you're going to
have sunny days and drought yet your
[SPEAKER_10]: product your product that comes out is
always going to be acceptable with maybe
[SPEAKER_10]: some minor dip sometimes when it's not
when you can control the environment you
[SPEAKER_10]: can control that trade presentation so
that's always optimal and that's what's
[SPEAKER_10]: exciting about this kind of approach can
you breed something that fits this
[SPEAKER_10]: particular spot and uh and can we develop
energy star plants and that's the thing
[SPEAKER_10]: i've been thinking about as someone with a
background in photomorphogenesis can we
[SPEAKER_10]: develop cultivars that wisely invest their
photons that turn signals from the ambient
[SPEAKER_10]: environment into into more immediate
developmental change get them fast out of
[SPEAKER_10]: the out of the gate to the industry a day
is money so if you can make it grow faster
[SPEAKER_10]: in the early development that translates
potentially to millions of dollars at the
[SPEAKER_10]: commercial level so if we were to do that
are there some ways that we could just
[SPEAKER_10]: take a look at the existing germplasm in
any given crop and start to make decisions
[SPEAKER_10]: about which which variety we may choose
because of its ability to integrate
[SPEAKER_10]: environmental signals more thoroughly and
that was the hypothesis we went to path
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was based on the idea of the fact
that plants have multiple photosensory
[SPEAKER_10]: systems different systems that sense the
red blue ultraviolet well near uv far red
[SPEAKER_10]: and even the green portion of the spectrum
and tailor physiological responses these
[SPEAKER_10]: are all mediated through different
photosensory pathways and could we
[SPEAKER_10]: identify varieties that have been selected
because they had a better response because
[SPEAKER_10]: of throughput through these individual
light sensing pathways so in other words
[SPEAKER_10]: is something more sensitive to red more
likely to give us a better yield and
[SPEAKER_10]: looking for those associations between
early and later growth and that's what
[SPEAKER_10]: we're working on now but the big deal is
is that you have all of these different
[SPEAKER_10]: input channels that we can monitor very
easily and very rapid experiments at the
[SPEAKER_10]: seedling level to begin to ask questions
about potential plant productivity and
[SPEAKER_10]: quality down the road so we think about a
rabidopsis talk about going back to
[SPEAKER_10]: organism envy the most mundane critter on
the earth it but a rabidopsis is great
[SPEAKER_10]: because we know a lot about it so this a
rabbit these two a rabidopsis seeds are
[SPEAKER_10]: these two plants two seedlings are
siblings from the same sleek one next to
[SPEAKER_10]: each other in that little seed pod and the
difference is is that they have radically
[SPEAKER_10]: different morphologies the difference
happening because one was grown in
[SPEAKER_10]: darkness one was grown under complete
light spectrum and you can see some
[SPEAKER_10]: significant changes an inhibition of
hypercodile elongation expansion of
[SPEAKER_10]: cotyledons development of chloroplasts and
chlorophyll a little root elongation thing
[SPEAKER_10]: going on there so these differences were
brought about because of that
[SPEAKER_10]: environmental signal I always like to show
this in schools I always say it's like
[SPEAKER_10]: having twins and one of you goes in the
closet for ten years and comes out taller
[SPEAKER_10]: you know kids get that idea so if we were
to look at some of these cues that light
[SPEAKER_10]: brings about such as changes in
hypercodile elongation or or or cotyledon
[SPEAKER_10]: expansion could that give us hints as to
certain varieties that may be more suited
[SPEAKER_10]: for growth in a controlled environment
because they integrate photons better and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's the hypothesis and the lettuce is
kind of neat because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: different varieties of lettuce out there
and lots of variation in color and and and
[SPEAKER_10]: other qualities other it's highly
homozygous so it gives us a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: opportunity to later on do very
sophisticated experiments to identify
[SPEAKER_10]: causal genes and it's easy to do these
experiments on petri dishes in 96 hours so
[SPEAKER_10]: instead of growing fields of plants to
identify it's it's a lot like marker
[SPEAKER_10]: assisted breeding the only thing is we're
looking at we're looking at markers which
[SPEAKER_10]: are morphological we're looking at how the
seedling behaves rather than looking at a
[SPEAKER_10]: PCR product or a DNA sequence we also are
working on automating this to be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: do massive numbers of seedlings at one
time so that's something else that's
[SPEAKER_10]: coming but what we what the main
hypothesis was is that if we see
[SPEAKER_10]: hypersensitivity in a seedling it may
translate to efficiency in mature plants
[SPEAKER_10]: or at least be able to get to be a mature
plant faster the other part of this is
[SPEAKER_10]: that could we look to hypersensitivity at
the blue or red far-red and be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: breed these things together to get all of
the hypersensitivities in one place at one
[SPEAKER_10]: time and the other part of this is that
could we could we really make an ultimate
[SPEAKER_10]: plant for a control light controlled
environment that may do very well in low
[SPEAKER_10]: light significantly fewer photons to get
the same output because all of the
[SPEAKER_10]: developmental channels were primed I'm
kind of a old-school disciple of Fritz
[SPEAKER_10]: went I really believe that yeah
photosynthesis is important but setting
[SPEAKER_10]: the stage for photosynthesis is even more
important and getting the plant to have a
[SPEAKER_10]: morphology that's more conducive to handle
the incoming light is even better how do
[SPEAKER_10]: you make a bigger antenna that kind of
thing and that's how we can maybe be able
[SPEAKER_10]: to grow plants with fewer with less light
energy coming in and so this is an example
[SPEAKER_10]: of how this works and this panel over here
is much better these two are the same I
[SPEAKER_10]: don't know how that happened over here it
gives you an idea of butter canes both
[SPEAKER_10]: grown under dim blue light this one very
very hypersensitive to light and this one
[SPEAKER_10]: very hyposensitive to light if I showed
you dark grown they'd look much more like
[SPEAKER_10]: this one here so there is just just
inherent variation that you see across
[SPEAKER_10]: lettuce and we're currently putting
together a paper where we've looked at
[SPEAKER_10]: over a hundred different lettuce varieties
under different spectral conditions and
[SPEAKER_10]: you see this massive variation that's
there that tells us a little bit about how
[SPEAKER_10]: it will respond to the light environment
we also have some hints and I'll show you
[SPEAKER_10]: one in a minute about how what we see in
the seedling does translate to more mature
[SPEAKER_10]: more mature plants as they grow so there's
this huge variety huge variation that we
[SPEAKER_10]: can exploit when we look at this and I'll
show you one really nice example Cade
[SPEAKER_10]: Cooper is an undergraduate in the lab he
does a really really nice job so down here
[SPEAKER_10]: on the bottom we have just regular oak
leaf lettuce grown under red light and
[SPEAKER_10]: blue light and white light and I didn't
put how much it's 50 micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_10]: square per second for those of you who
enjoy that stuff so just kind of about
[SPEAKER_10]: three times room light and if you look at
this Thai oak leaf accession that that
[SPEAKER_10]: that is available you see it looks doesn't
quite expand the same way under white
[SPEAKER_10]: looks about the same under blue and under
red has very long hypocotyls and very
[SPEAKER_10]: small cotyledons almost like it's not
seeing light it looks a lot like those
[SPEAKER_10]: dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings so what
this is telling us perhaps is that when
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not seeing red it's signaling a
deficiency in the ability to transduce red
[SPEAKER_10]: light signals you fight at Chrome B one of
the red light sensors and that it's
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent with a lesion in phytochrome B
signaling what's really cool about that is
[SPEAKER_10]: that we also know phytochrome B has some
other problems it also shows a little hint
[SPEAKER_10]: or hypersensitivity to shade so shade
avoidance responses are when you move a
[SPEAKER_10]: plant from full sunlight into shade the
spectrum changes you see an inversion of
[SPEAKER_10]: the red to far-red ratio you have much
more far-red than red and also a
[SPEAKER_10]: significant amount of green to red green
to blue and that shift causes plants to
[SPEAKER_10]: take on a shaded phenotype so that rosette
plant that typically is flat on the ground
[SPEAKER_10]: will begin to have exaggerations in leaf
inclination and leaf expansion so it tries
[SPEAKER_10]: to reach above its neighbors the sensing
that it's it's close to as close proximity
[SPEAKER_10]: to neighbors or maybe being under a canopy
so those morphological changes occur to
[SPEAKER_10]: help it get up above so if this is a
phytochrome B mutant we would expect it to
[SPEAKER_10]: have that same sort of exaggerated rosette
phenotype and we would accept expect it to
[SPEAKER_10]: be extremely exaggerated if we change the
red to far-red ratio and that's exactly
[SPEAKER_10]: what we see so those were the quantitative
data for the previous thing so here here
[SPEAKER_10]: is regular oak leaf lettuce just in red
with a very strong well an even red to
[SPEAKER_10]: far-red ratio here's another type of
lettuce red to far-red and here's that
[SPEAKER_10]: Thai oak leaf and as predicted it has that
exaggerated shade stress phenotype even
[SPEAKER_10]: though it has plenty of red light it
doesn't appear to be in the shade it
[SPEAKER_10]: thinks it is in the ship because its photo
sensors are out of whack if we elevate the
[SPEAKER_10]: far-red and decrease well keep if we
change the red to far-red ratio to favor
[SPEAKER_10]: far-red we see that exaggeration in the
other varieties an extreme exaggeration
[SPEAKER_10]: over here so this was kind of a this was
again was consistent with the idea that we
[SPEAKER_10]: could look at seedlings and begin to make
predictions about how mature plants would
[SPEAKER_10]: grow the funny part about this funny the
interesting part about this is that we
[SPEAKER_10]: went back to say well what's going on with
this Thai oak leaf lettuce what do we know
[SPEAKER_10]: about it where does it come from why was
it selected and there's very little
[SPEAKER_10]: information known because really only a
couple places sell it but it turns out oh
[SPEAKER_10]: before I get to that sorry it turns out
that Phi B Phytochrome B where we saw the
[SPEAKER_10]: lesion in red light sensitivities this is
Arabidopsis under red light wild type and
[SPEAKER_10]: Phi B mutant this looks a lot like that
Thai oak leaf seedling under red light and
[SPEAKER_10]: it turns out Phytochrome B is a thermal
sensor it helps with with constraining the
[SPEAKER_10]: response to heat on warm nights so
Phytochrome B is working presumably to
[SPEAKER_10]: tailor plant responses to heat and number
of papers came out and science and other
[SPEAKER_10]: places that really show this very well and
so we may predict that Thai oak leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: selected for a long hypocotyl may be more
amenable to growing in warm conditions
[SPEAKER_10]: especially warm nights like we have in
Florida like we might have in a controlled
[SPEAKER_10]: environment right so it turns out that if
you go back and look at why was this thing
[SPEAKER_10]: selected where did it come from who did
this Thai oak leaf lettuce loose leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: lettuce here it says grows pretty fast but
excellent quality lettuce under high heat
[SPEAKER_10]: a favorite resembles oak leaf but with
larger more tender and more upright leaves
[SPEAKER_10]: so all of these things that we figured out
backwards by looking at seedlings and
[SPEAKER_10]: analyzing behavior were things that they
already knew and it was the basis of
[SPEAKER_10]: selection for this variety so really
validated our approach and if we would
[SPEAKER_10]: have just paid attention to the website we
ordered the seeds from we could have saved
[SPEAKER_10]: ourselves a lot of time but it validates
the approach it says that we can use
[SPEAKER_10]: phenotypes to potentially learn something
about the long-term growth and
[SPEAKER_10]: developmental characteristics of a crop
plant and the reason this gets exciting is
[SPEAKER_10]: because in Florida lettuce is a
significant industry we grow lettuce in
[SPEAKER_10]: the winter the problem is when it gets
warm some things happen we get bolting and
[SPEAKER_10]: and poor growth here you have a lettuce
that's heat tolerant and shows moderately
[SPEAKER_10]: slow to bolt so what this suggests is that
if we want to accelerate lettuce breeding
[SPEAKER_10]: for Florida we could potentially be
growing them under red light looking at
[SPEAKER_10]: seedlings and automating that process
watching seedlings grow through time and
[SPEAKER_10]: finding the ones that grow fast through
red light and when we make crosses between
[SPEAKER_10]: heat tolerant varieties and maybe those
that are not look using the phytochrome B
[SPEAKER_10]: deficiency as a way to signal which ones
may give us better ability to grow in the
[SPEAKER_10]: field then we can test that and that's
where we are right now we're currently
[SPEAKER_10]: validating a number of varieties and a
number of crosses to see if that
[SPEAKER_10]: hypothesis is supported pretty cool stuff
and and the big deal with that is that we
[SPEAKER_10]: aren't just constrained to lettuce this is
phytochrome B this is a this is a photo
[SPEAKER_10]: sensor that's ubiquitous and could we
potentially be looking at any particular
[SPEAKER_10]: seedling to identify heat insensitive or
maybe better heat coping varieties by
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at the seedlings which don't grow
short under red light and and then of
[SPEAKER_10]: course what does that say in the long term
about flowering and productivity there's
[SPEAKER_10]: other caveats of course some things we
don't want to flower some things we don't
[SPEAKER_10]: want to bolt other things it's pretty
important so it's going to depend on the
[SPEAKER_10]: specific crop but it goes to an
interesting idea that we can use a
[SPEAKER_10]: seedling to tell us about energy
consumption and right now especially as
[SPEAKER_10]: climates are changing and things are
getting warmer the vegetative crops like
[SPEAKER_10]: your basils and your lettuce and those
things if we can look at the seedling
[SPEAKER_10]: level to begin to make selections maybe
can go a lot faster and the other point on
[SPEAKER_10]: this is in a controlled environment some
of the big expenses of course are energy
[SPEAKER_10]: something like at least a third is some
estimate as high as 60 percent of the
[SPEAKER_10]: budget of a closed controlled environment
is in lighting it and then getting rid of
[SPEAKER_10]: the heat from the light if you could keep
things a couple degrees warmer by growing
[SPEAKER_10]: crops which maybe grow a little bit faster
but also are insensitive to the heat or
[SPEAKER_10]: lower better able to handle the heat
perhaps this could be another solution for
[SPEAKER_10]: the controlled environment failure problem
the other thing that's really important is
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this idea of controlled
environments another opportunity in the
[SPEAKER_10]: crisis is can we breed for plasticity and
this is another neat one that that that we
[SPEAKER_10]: worked on was examining lettuce varieties
for those that could give us the widest
[SPEAKER_10]: array of phenotypes from one common
genotype so we talked before about the
[SPEAKER_10]: idea of genetics and environment could we
put the same set of genetics in two
[SPEAKER_10]: separate environments to get two different
products so in other words a grower would
[SPEAKER_10]: only have to buy one set of seeds
understand the management around one set
[SPEAKER_10]: of seeds and then test the market and say
what do you want purple or green and then
[SPEAKER_10]: push the switch that gives you purple or
green it's a it's another aspect that
[SPEAKER_10]: hasn't been exploited yet by controlled
environment agriculture but an important
[SPEAKER_10]: part of plant whispering that I think that
that is something that should be adopted I
[SPEAKER_10]: think the idea that can we grow a variety
of plants from start one set of plants and
[SPEAKER_10]: then divide that up based upon the demand
from the from the market and I don't pay
[SPEAKER_10]: attention to this on-off stuff yet I'll
get to that in a minute but this is one
[SPEAKER_10]: variety of lettuce that's already exists
where we can make three very distinct
[SPEAKER_10]: products just by how much we turn the
light off so we're investing darkness to
[SPEAKER_10]: change the product and potentially put
more kilograms per bag or more biomass per
[SPEAKER_10]: bag by investing less in energy so as a
grower this is a good thing you're costing
[SPEAKER_10]: me less money but I'm getting a more
valuable product and so maybe that's
[SPEAKER_10]: another way that we need to think about
this and we'll come back to this in a
[SPEAKER_10]: minute this next picture I'll show you
shows you how when we take one variety of
[SPEAKER_10]: lettuce that we've been working with we
can place it into six different light
[SPEAKER_10]: conditions and generate six different
products so that's six different products
[SPEAKER_10]: that are coming from one set of genetics
so one G and six E's well taking that one
[SPEAKER_10]: set of G and pulling it in six different
directions to make six different products
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's another way to think about how we
can better exploit controlled environments
[SPEAKER_10]: and right now we're looking at herbs we're
doing a lot with this because we've done
[SPEAKER_10]: some interesting preliminary data we have
some interesting preliminary data on the
[SPEAKER_10]: flavors and aromas of basil and shown that
when we put it into a controlled
[SPEAKER_10]: environment of different spectral quality
we can radically shift the components that
[SPEAKER_10]: lead to liking and not liking and this is
old published work at this point the thing
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to take home so what we're
looking at here the major classes of
[SPEAKER_10]: flavor compounds and then how they look in
a greenhouse so you're looking at less
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff and more stuff as you go from green
to purple less of this and and then
[SPEAKER_10]: shifting as we go up into more complicated
narrow bandwidth environments and it
[SPEAKER_10]: really shows that there's a tremendous
opportunity to just as you're pulling
[SPEAKER_10]: colors in that salad be able to pull at
the molecular circuitry that underlies the
[SPEAKER_10]: production of flavor and aroma compounds
and what was particularly interesting
[SPEAKER_10]: about this that we learned something
really cool about this when I teach my
[SPEAKER_10]: plant physiology classes I talked about
how plants adapt to a new environment how
[SPEAKER_10]: that's why they survive that there have to
be agile and and adapt to the new ambient
[SPEAKER_10]: environment that's why they do what they
do we have really nice data that show that
[SPEAKER_10]: once you're born in the greenhouse under a
full solar spectrum you remember that you
[SPEAKER_10]: were born under a full solar spectrum even
if we do funny things to you later and if
[SPEAKER_10]: you were born under LEDs and an electronic
canopy of narrow bandwidth light we move
[SPEAKER_10]: you to the greenhouse you remember that
you were born under funny lights and this
[SPEAKER_10]: is this shows that maybe we need to think
a little bit more about the way we treat
[SPEAKER_10]: plants early how we can shift them to
different environments later on there's a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot more layers to controlled environments
than simply putting them under a pink
[SPEAKER_10]: static illumination and I think that's
another trick that as we move forward and
[SPEAKER_10]: become more sophisticated in our
treatments may make the idea of controlled
[SPEAKER_10]: environment agriculture increasingly more
viable so how do we and then this is
[SPEAKER_10]: always the part that I like the best how
do we do something weird how do we break
[SPEAKER_10]: biology by or enhanced biology by doing
something that nature never intended by
[SPEAKER_10]: taking something that evolved under a on
an evolving planet of dark and light of a
[SPEAKER_10]: solar spectrum that's complete and now we
throw it into an environment that could
[SPEAKER_10]: never happen on earth could we get
something beneficial or better yet could
[SPEAKER_10]: we learn something that could inform the
development of new practices that allow us
[SPEAKER_10]: to save energy and this is kind of neat I
think this is kind of fun and it's working
[SPEAKER_10]: well so what if we were to take plants and
instead of breaking up the day into 12
[SPEAKER_10]: hours of dark and 12 hours of light we
said let's give them eight hours of dark
[SPEAKER_10]: eight hours of light three times and six
hours of dark six hours of light ten
[SPEAKER_10]: minutes of dark ten minutes of light what
if we broke up the day like that and we
[SPEAKER_10]: have some specialized equipment that's
homemade that does this and what's really
[SPEAKER_10]: neat about this and what you might be
thinking as well fault that you're an
[SPEAKER_10]: idiot because it's the same number of
photons in both cases the same amount of
[SPEAKER_10]: energy still 12 hours on 12 hours off and
you're right but I'll show you what how
[SPEAKER_10]: this gets really cool so if we look at
let's just look at hypocotily longish this
[SPEAKER_10]: is um these are ceilings of different crop
plants or ceilings of kale turn up and
[SPEAKER_10]: beat all of which are used as commercial
sprouts and let's stay with hypocotily
[SPEAKER_10]: elongation what you see here is that if we
go 12 hours on 12 hours off you see this
[SPEAKER_10]: nice suppression of hypocotily elongation
that says you're getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: integration of light signals and if you
start to mess with this we'll stay up here
[SPEAKER_10]: in tail as you start making that interval
shorter and shorter the plant appears to
[SPEAKER_10]: be more dark like so it's getting the same
number of photons but as you break it up
[SPEAKER_10]: means you make the photos the
photomorphogenic integration of those
[SPEAKER_10]: signals less correct until you get down
into the five seconds on five seconds off
[SPEAKER_10]: range so you start getting into the range
down here you're actually doing a really
[SPEAKER_10]: nice job when you start getting into five
seconds on five seconds off and that's
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of interesting so all of a sudden the
plant is thinking that it's under constant
[SPEAKER_10]: illumination again all right so so let's
just keep that in mind the 12 hours on and
[SPEAKER_10]: off and the in the five seconds on and off
appear to be the same where the rest
[SPEAKER_10]: aren't and we wrote this paper there's
more to it coming up but we wrote this
[SPEAKER_10]: paper it's all done and the student who
was in my lab he was an undergraduate he
[SPEAKER_10]: was awesome and he comes to me and says oh
yeah hey by the way um this is all good
[SPEAKER_10]: but um somebody already did this and he's
actually a professor of bargaining and now
[SPEAKER_10]: he's he's a good guy um he uh he said
somebody already did this and it turns out
[SPEAKER_10]: that he went back in the literature and
found a paper from garner and allard in
[SPEAKER_10]: 1931 or garner and allard did the same
damn thing only with um cosmos and uh some
[SPEAKER_10]: other critter probably i don't know
something else larc spur whatever that is
[SPEAKER_10]: but the idea was as you grew them under
different intervals of dark and light and
[SPEAKER_10]: i love the old things fritz went did a lot
of this too one you just put plants in
[SPEAKER_10]: funny environments and saw what would
happen but here they were doing those
[SPEAKER_10]: treatments 12 hours on and off one hour
not so good and down to five seconds on
[SPEAKER_10]: and off it comes back so it's like almost
the same experiments that that they did 80
[SPEAKER_10]: years previous and looked very similar to
the data that we got um on something like
[SPEAKER_10]: kale and this anthocyanin accumulation
which could also be used as a marker of
[SPEAKER_10]: photomorphogenic development so um the
coloration that we see in the stem uh
[SPEAKER_10]: started high and it was really really high
after five five seconds on off okay so now
[SPEAKER_10]: we go back to oh so why is this happening
why is why is short not bothering the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant and what this shows is the
complicated mechanism that's in training a
[SPEAKER_10]: circadian oscillator the internal
oscillator of the plant is what's
[SPEAKER_10]: measuring that day length and reporting to
the nucleus to coordinate gene expression
[SPEAKER_10]: so that gene expression is appropriate and
anticipating the next light cycle after a
[SPEAKER_10]: certain period of darkness and it's been
very well dissected i think what's
[SPEAKER_10]: happening and we're testing this now is
that when we give these short little
[SPEAKER_10]: pulses in the beginning that seed to
germinate it never really conditions a
[SPEAKER_10]: clock the oscillator never is moving in
any particular direction so we kind of are
[SPEAKER_10]: bypassing the oscillator and just running
the plant strictly upon upon input signals
[SPEAKER_10]: from the um small pulses and that when
you're at 12 hours on 12 hours off you're
[SPEAKER_10]: running a normal daylight cycle just like
you're on a spinning planet yet if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing one hour on one hour off it's
unfavorable because the oscillator starts
[SPEAKER_10]: that it has to reset and so i think that's
why we're seeing what we're seeing and
[SPEAKER_10]: we're testing that hypothesis but going
back to practical application okay now
[SPEAKER_10]: this is where you say both of you're an
idiot uh the um you're still giving 12
[SPEAKER_10]: hours of light a day it's just breaking it
into little pieces how are you saving
[SPEAKER_10]: anyone any energy okay so what if we were
to do five seconds on five seconds off
[SPEAKER_10]: okay still 12 hours a day of total
illumination same dl i daily light
[SPEAKER_10]: integral what if we did five seconds on
six seconds off what if we did five
[SPEAKER_10]: seconds on 10 seconds off five seconds on
20 seconds now you begin to see how this
[SPEAKER_10]: might work because we're not perturbing
the oscillator yet we're providing light
[SPEAKER_10]: energy for photosynthesis we're just
giving it in packets every so many seconds
[SPEAKER_10]: and the plant isn't perturbed
physiologically because the oscillator
[SPEAKER_10]: can't really figure out what's going on so
this is a way in which which would work
[SPEAKER_10]: great and maybe being able to save some
energy in a controlled environment
[SPEAKER_10]: situation by pulsing the light and so when
we did this it worked really well um well
[SPEAKER_10]: if we stay on this end where we look at
kind of blue red and fire red treatments
[SPEAKER_10]: is you could go five seconds on five
seconds off and show a nice short seedling
[SPEAKER_10]: that's integrating this is hypochondrile
elongation on this axis and then this one
[SPEAKER_10]: is five 10 20 40 or 160 seconds between
pulses and what you see is that whether
[SPEAKER_10]: you give five seconds on five seconds off
or 10 seconds on 10 seconds off doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: matter and in some cases you see uh
sustained integration and this is only at
[SPEAKER_10]: one fluent rate one light intensity that
adds we increase the light intensity we
[SPEAKER_10]: actually bring this out a little further
so what this says is that the uh the
[SPEAKER_10]: ability to sustain a light signal into a
growth and development response can be
[SPEAKER_10]: done in darkness if you apply that light
then you let it go in darkness and uh and
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been able to show that we've been
able to get this significantly out i mean
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been uh probably 20 seconds stays
about the same when we use certain fluence
[SPEAKER_10]: rates of light so this seems like a really
positive way to be able to control and
[SPEAKER_10]: modulate the uh growth of seedlings or any
or plants in a controlled environment the
[SPEAKER_10]: other thing we did which i neglected to
put in in the slides here is we did this
[SPEAKER_10]: in a rabidopsis and so when we did this in
a rabidopsis we were able to to test the
[SPEAKER_10]: photomorphogenic mutants of a rabidopsis
and say what are the light sensors that
[SPEAKER_10]: are contributing to the response and what
we were able to show is that this is
[SPEAKER_10]: primarily a phytochrome a b and
phytochrome b and uh cry one cryptochrome
[SPEAKER_10]: one mediated response so it's responding
to blue red and far red portions of the
[SPEAKER_10]: spectrum a lot like we see here and so the
way to think about this is so what we were
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking about was okay if we take away
those receptors we still we still see uh
[SPEAKER_10]: we still see that they're well we we still
we see that they return to the normal size
[SPEAKER_10]: because of a lack of inhibition but
biology works in two directions usually
[SPEAKER_10]: when you look at biology for every push
you've got a poll right that for every
[SPEAKER_10]: inhibition you've got something that's
promoting and these things kind of work
[SPEAKER_10]: against each other we see this exquisitely
in hormone systems where positive and
[SPEAKER_10]: negative regulators work in concert
together to modulate the precision of some
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of output response and in keeping
with that idea we started to think about
[SPEAKER_10]: what other ways might there be a pushback
against this process and so um this was a
[SPEAKER_10]: really cool experiment that was done back
by shui shung a couple years ago visiting
[SPEAKER_10]: scientist and was just recently repeated
by an undergraduate in the lab and this is
[SPEAKER_10]: the phototrope in one mutant another blue
light receptor so when we do this the same
[SPEAKER_10]: experiment and the phototrope in one
mutants we show that the light signal and
[SPEAKER_10]: one interpretation may be that the light
signal is is sustained even out past 40
[SPEAKER_10]: seconds of darkness and still even after
80 seconds off you still see sustained
[SPEAKER_10]: evidence that that light signal is
persisting so it's almost like boat one is
[SPEAKER_10]: the system which is shutting off the light
input we've got some that are stepping on
[SPEAKER_10]: the gas some that are stepping on the
brakes here we've taken away the brakes
[SPEAKER_10]: why that's important is is can you imagine
moving into a gene editing need gene
[SPEAKER_10]: editing situation here could we mutagenize
vote one knock out vote one and now be
[SPEAKER_10]: able to make plants that are even better
at integrating light signals and if you
[SPEAKER_10]: don't like genetic engineering and CRISPR
stuff what if you just look for the plants
[SPEAKER_10]: in your favorite crop that didn't bend
towards light when mutagenized do those
[SPEAKER_10]: incorporate light signals better and
that's the hypothesis we're testing right
[SPEAKER_10]: so we're looking at whereas these are
driving it forward but one appears to be
[SPEAKER_10]: pushing back and it doesn't seem
consistent with both ones known roles but
[SPEAKER_10]: no one's ever grown fault one no one's
ever grown plants under a flashing light
[SPEAKER_10]: at five second intervals so there's so the
take-home message on all of this is is
[SPEAKER_10]: that when we put plants in a truly novel
environment which is what we're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: do in space and we identify new trends and
new ways that may be able to be translated
[SPEAKER_10]: into controlled environments here on the
earth and I think this is a really nice
[SPEAKER_10]: example that you can do something that
maybe doesn't make a lot of sense on the
[SPEAKER_10]: be on the on the outside but begin to
disclose new phenomenology that not only
[SPEAKER_10]: define biology a little bit more different
if it works because finally we can meet if
[SPEAKER_10]: we can grow plants in a in a in a
controlled environment closed controlled
[SPEAKER_10]: environment only apply the light signal
once every 20 seconds perhaps that has the
[SPEAKER_10]: ability to translate into a viability in
that particular industry so that was the
[SPEAKER_10]: really the new ideas is can we come up
with new varieties by looking at light
[SPEAKER_10]: phenotypes of seedlings that generate new
varieties that may be a more amenable to
[SPEAKER_10]: use in controlled environments and can we
come up with funny ways to illuminate
[SPEAKER_10]: plants that also give us new practices and
can we put the two together so can we
[SPEAKER_10]: divide can we select for a plant that does
well in a completely foreign environment
[SPEAKER_10]: and is that going to be a way that we can
add to food security in the future have
[SPEAKER_10]: more choices for consumers in the
industrialized world and maybe have more
[SPEAKER_10]: opportunities to explore plant biology by
creating something unusual and seeing how
[SPEAKER_10]: it works in a strange environment so
that's a that's my punch line so so just
[SPEAKER_10]: to kind of conclude we need to have our
genetics match the environment just like
[SPEAKER_10]: the dachshunds pulling the dog sled you
have to have environment you have to have
[SPEAKER_10]: genetics that match and that can we use
seedling traits to see what's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: work in cea and i think we can and then um
and that the traits of interest for
[SPEAKER_10]: controlled environment are very different
from the field potentially and some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: things that we find for cea may translate
well to the field under hot conditions or
[SPEAKER_10]: conditions like florida and can we use
under unconventional delivery of light to
[SPEAKER_10]: save energy and this idea of pulses where
we're actually investing darkness to
[SPEAKER_10]: create more phenotypes to plasticity and
at the same time producing good consumer
[SPEAKER_10]: products by saving money that could be
potentially very nice and so combining all
[SPEAKER_10]: this together may be the way that we solve
those problems and so with that i will
[SPEAKER_10]: thank you and check out talking biotech it
took me 10 years since i started doing
[SPEAKER_10]: this stupid thing um and uh and every week
for the last 10 years so check that out
[SPEAKER_10]: and uh i guess that's everything if you
know the other thing is is that if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: a student or a postdoc and you want to
join me as a co-host please reach out i'd
[SPEAKER_10]: love to have you aboard it really works
out nice i write all the questions ahead
[SPEAKER_10]: of time and and you sound brilliant and
it's a great way to get another line in
[SPEAKER_10]: the cv and more importantly it's another
way to dip your toe in science
[SPEAKER_10]: communication and also show evidence that
you're interested in public education and
[SPEAKER_10]: extension and for those of you who are on
the job market that one line may make a
[SPEAKER_10]: very important impact as someone who is a
former department chair we had stacks of
[SPEAKER_10]: applicants like this and the top this much
were all very good and the things that
[SPEAKER_10]: separated them may have been a line about
how they were interested in public
[SPEAKER_10]: education and extension so take me up on
that and i'd be happy to do it so why
[SPEAKER_10]: don't i stop there and i'll be very happy
to take questions questions at least yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah so c3 c4 and cam systems how they
would respond differently you know i have
[SPEAKER_10]: no idea i haven't i i couldn't have
guessed how how they were going to respond
[SPEAKER_10]: so yeah i haven't gotten that
sophisticated yet in thinking about our
[SPEAKER_10]: testing it but yeah there may be some
differences that's a good point yes yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: so the question is even though we heard
that making something similar simple is
[SPEAKER_10]: better and simplifying our approaches
makes more sense here we're looking at a
[SPEAKER_10]: whole variety of different variables and
complexities that make this even more
[SPEAKER_10]: challenging how do you believe bring the
two together i think that's the trick
[SPEAKER_10]: though right how do we how do we it is a
good question i think that i appreciate
[SPEAKER_10]: the idea of simplicity as well and i've
always been an under thinker of problems
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's been my key to success and and
maybe that's ultimately what the
[SPEAKER_10]: complicate where all of these complicated
ideas come from is how do we just do
[SPEAKER_10]: something different you know and it is a
question of under thinking it i think i
[SPEAKER_10]: think it is making maybe it is making it
simpler that's a complicated question can
[SPEAKER_10]: i think about that and get back to you i'm
trying to think about it on my feet and
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm confusing this yeah yeah yeah and and
but here's the point of this other comment
[SPEAKER_10]: was that you can make things very simple
with a controlled environment so why are
[SPEAKER_10]: what you know why make it complex with
lots of variables and i think that plants
[SPEAKER_10]: are really complex and in order to
maximize the output we have to be
[SPEAKER_10]: sensitive to those complexities and learn
how to optimize our inputs to get the most
[SPEAKER_10]: appropriate output so yeah we can make it
simple and we can say we're going to put
[SPEAKER_10]: plants under one spectrum and grow them
for 38 days and then sell it and market or
[SPEAKER_10]: perhaps say let's interject these ideas of
early in development we can get greater
[SPEAKER_10]: leaf expansion with more blue light and
far red and by limiting the red and then
[SPEAKER_10]: as this thing grows we'll put under a
complete spectrum then we're going to put
[SPEAKER_10]: it in a far red enhanced spectrum to
elongate the leaves and get more dollars
[SPEAKER_10]: in the bag for the grower and then at the
end we're going to suppress the flowering
[SPEAKER_10]: response and bolting with application of
red light or whatever it is that kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: dynamic system is something you can only
do by taking apart and dissecting each
[SPEAKER_10]: each part of a plant's biology and so i i
why i appreciate the simplicity i think is
[SPEAKER_10]: very true plants are complex and let's
play with that complexity and play into it
[SPEAKER_10]: i think that's the better answer for me
any other questions yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: here so the question is how do you know
you're making good changes and and and
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimately could you have flimsier leaves
or as we've shown before massive
[SPEAKER_10]: accumulation of glucosinolates that are so
awful that you can't taste it is so bitter
[SPEAKER_10]: um yeah these are all really good points
but the answer is we get to do the
[SPEAKER_10]: experiment and i think there's a
tremendous sense of job security that'll
[SPEAKER_10]: take me through retirement to sort this
out because how do you what is there
[SPEAKER_10]: inside a given genotype that we can
squeeze out by pushing the different
[SPEAKER_10]: levers and i think that's neat i think
that's neat yeah yeah yeah so the question
[SPEAKER_10]: is when your pulse in light are you
shortening the lifespan of commercial
[SPEAKER_10]: light arrays leds and their associated
electronics and and yeah all these things
[SPEAKER_10]: are controlled with pulse wave modulators
and you're you know jamming current
[SPEAKER_10]: through these things left and right and
pulses it may shorten them but that's for
[SPEAKER_10]: engineers to figure out and you know i'm a
guy with a soldering iron and a little
[SPEAKER_10]: enough know how to be dangerous and build
funny things out of raspberry pies so um
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah yeah it probably does um it probably
is really hard on the electronics and it
[SPEAKER_10]: probably doesn't save as much electricity
as we think because there's a little spike
[SPEAKER_10]: when you start those leds so there so
there are some considerations so we've
[SPEAKER_10]: looked at that but um but yeah ultimately
i i don't think that it would take away
[SPEAKER_10]: from the energy savings ultimately and
even if it did energy savings are energy
[SPEAKER_10]: savings and people uh and i think that's
important saving energy especially you
[SPEAKER_10]: know and probably could argue takes more
energy to make the damn leds you know and
[SPEAKER_09]: that may be true yeah you just gave me
something new to think about there um no
[SPEAKER_10]: we we've been doing a lot these are really
easy experiments for undergraduates is you
[SPEAKER_10]: know take these plants and put them in
some condition and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: move them to normal and see what happens
and we're seeing a lot of evidence of this
[SPEAKER_10]: that there must be something early that
happens in development either at the level
[SPEAKER_10]: of a plastid or something epigenetic that
happens during your first days of
[SPEAKER_10]: existence that shapes the way you respond
to things later and i think that kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: this also holds a potential to be
applicable in controlled environments
[SPEAKER_10]: because if we can give you this
conditioning early like blue light first
[SPEAKER_10]: days that you're going to flower later
that's pretty good i think people are much
[SPEAKER_10]: happier spraying plants with photons than
chemistry and so i think this bodes well
[SPEAKER_10]: for the potential in controlled
environments yes yeah so we're not doing
[SPEAKER_10]: those experiments yet um i'm excited to
think about writing to get money to do
[SPEAKER_10]: them but i'm short on preliminary data
we've got some beautiful suggestive data
[SPEAKER_10]: that look like we're onto something but i
don't think enough to motivate a panel to
[SPEAKER_10]: throw dollars at us yet so i've got a team
of undergraduates chipping away at this as
[SPEAKER_10]: we speak so yeah now they may have gone
home by now never mind any other questions
[SPEAKER_10]: anymore okay good yeah nice so have we
done this experiment strawberry or other
[SPEAKER_10]: crop genetics haven't really yet we've
stuck with kind of these leafy green
[SPEAKER_10]: sprouty things because they're leafy
greens and sprouts because they're
[SPEAKER_10]: directly germane to the industry in
controlled environments strawberries are
[SPEAKER_10]: too but that's a fruit and that's a whole
nother thing i've kind of drifted out of
[SPEAKER_10]: strawberries we it was a big deal for a
long time but there's there's not as much
[SPEAKER_10]: industry interest and they're more
interested in ways of dealing with
[SPEAKER_10]: practical problems and competition from
mexico you know and things like that are
[SPEAKER_10]: much bigger issues than can we put a funny
light on it you know so yeah unfortunately
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah there's another question yes
[SPEAKER_10]: ah you're you you you read my proposal for
the swiss army plant yeah yeah we would uh
[SPEAKER_10]: this was an idea for nasa you know you you
can't take it with you um can't take a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of things with you so can you take
something that can agilely produce a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of useful secondary metabolites and put
them under different controllable
[SPEAKER_10]: promoters to take one plant that can give
you different secondary metabolites that
[SPEAKER_10]: could be used either as antibiotics
chemotherapeutic agents potentially at or
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever you could you do that i think
there's something there i think that's a
[SPEAKER_10]: really neat idea for those of you are big
fans of brassica domestication you know
[SPEAKER_10]: you can take one set of genetics and tug
it in a couple different directions with a
[SPEAKER_10]: few tweaks you give very different outputs
and i think we could use controllable
[SPEAKER_10]: promoters and then they're um and they're
uh and and the signals that ignite them to
[SPEAKER_10]: give us different outputs yeah it's a
pretty neat idea anything else give up end
[SPEAKER_10]: of day i'll be around so we can talk more
but oh do you have another question or no
[SPEAKER_10]: no okay well thank you very much thank you
for having me over yeah i would really
[SPEAKER_07]: like to thank kevin i got multiple emails
last night that i woke up to um he arrived
[SPEAKER_07]: in buffalo sometime after midnight and
made the drive from buffalo to ithaca i
[SPEAKER_07]: think he got in ithaca 5 a.m was it so
then he got here around 10 so he's he's a
[SPEAKER_07]: trooper and we very much appreciate your
commitment to our symposium well that um
[SPEAKER_07]: concludes our symposium i'd like to thank
all of you here and all of you on zoom for
[SPEAKER_07]: attending this wonderful occasion that
we've had a chance to hear these fantastic
[SPEAKER_07]: speakers so can we get a another round of
applause for everyone who spoke today
[SPEAKER_07]: i'll keep asking for some applause can we
uh thank jason our wonderful it tech who's
[SPEAKER_07]: been so helpful this year and last year
and i'd also like to thank the sips event
[SPEAKER_07]: coordinator danielle hill um she um
coordinated travel with all these speakers
[SPEAKER_07]: and helped order the food and just made
the committee's lives very easy so can we
[SPEAKER_07]: give her a round of applause
[SPEAKER_07]: well we're gonna make your hand sore um
can we uh also give a round of applause to
[SPEAKER_07]: the committee tim baswati bahia shrikant
and me and everyone else
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah and of course we can't forget our
funding sources so thank you corteva
[SPEAKER_07]: you're amazing and we very much appreciate
all you guys do
[SPEAKER_07]: when we kind of planned this committee we
wanted a wide range of topics and so we
[SPEAKER_07]: picked a very broad um theme and i think
you know we heard from about mushrooms
[SPEAKER_07]: algae lettuce cover crops really
everything you can think of in plant
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding and well really not plant
breeding but and just breeding in general
[SPEAKER_07]: and so i hope you guys can come away with
you know some novel ideas and thoughts for
[SPEAKER_07]: your own research and maybe for us grad
students maybe we don't have to stick with
[SPEAKER_07]: our crops and we can venture forth to
something new and exciting um yeah i'd
[SPEAKER_07]: like to thank you all and please join us
for happy hour and continue networking and
[SPEAKER_07]: making good friendships with everyone
thank you this has been a production of
