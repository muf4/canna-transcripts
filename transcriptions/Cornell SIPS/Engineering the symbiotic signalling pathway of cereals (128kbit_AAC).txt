[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real pleasure to be here at
Cornell, and I'm glad that Alan arranged
[SPEAKER_00]: it so that the snow cleared just before my
arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to be talking about the
nitrogen problem in food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very familiar problem, and this is
a very familiar sight in most of our food
[SPEAKER_00]: production in both the US and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavy use of nitrogenous fertilizers
that promote crop growth, and really
[SPEAKER_00]: without that use of nitrogenous
fertilizers, we couldn't support the
[SPEAKER_00]: population that we currently support on
the planet, and we certainly couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: support an expanding population going up
to 10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to see a society
that weans itself off this use of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we're very dependent on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been estimated that the natural
nitrogen cycle can support about 3 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could imagine that 4 billion people
are currently dependent on Haber-Bosch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by 2050, we'll have about 7 billion
people dependent on the Haber-Bosch
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to imagine how we get
away from this heavy use of nitrogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is one of the results of those
nitrogenous fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lake in China, heavy
contamination from nitrogen pollution
[SPEAKER_00]: causing these algal blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, nitrogen fertilizers are
one of the major agricultural pollutants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we get on our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the reactive nitrogen that is
polluting both our aquatic systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: also our atmosphere is originating from
the use of nitrogenous fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, today, I'm not really going
to talk too much about the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation that we get from our nitrogen
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more a focus on the inequality
of the availability of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this map, I'm showing you the global
nitrogen consumption around the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that places... I don't
know whether this... I don't think these
[SPEAKER_00]: don't work due to the pointers on the
screen like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dark green areas like here in the
US and Western Europe and China and India,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy uses of nitrogen fertilizers and,
as I said, with all the consequent
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, in some ways, a tragedy on
this is when you look at sub-Saharan
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, it's almost a blank on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very limited use of nitrogenous
fertilizers in African agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because most farmers in Africa,
in sub-Saharan Africa, are smallholder
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than a hectare of land, very little
financial resources available to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and simply not the capability to purchase
the nitrogenous fertilizers, the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities available to purchase the
nitrogenous fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, if we look at
this analysis that was published in Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: a few years ago, here they were asking,
what is limiting maize productivity around
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is only looking at maize,
but you can go to this paper and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see also all the other cereal crops,
wheat and rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's in green, then it's already
50% above the yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's out of the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only the regions that are not
achieving a yield potential, so well below
[SPEAKER_00]: the 50% yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the areas that are not achieving their
yield potential, they ask, is it the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of nutrients or is it the
availability of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is actually a very
surprising result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue means it's both nutrients and
water, and red means it's just nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only parts of the arid areas of
Eastern Africa where if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your productivity, you have to
irrigate and add fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the maize-growing areas in the
world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really not water limitation that's
restricting growth, it's the availability
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those nutrients are nitrogen and
phosphorus, the dominant ingredients of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are going to increase
productivity in these areas of sub-Saharan
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, and in particular increase
productivity for smallholder farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to tackle this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't tackle this issue,
then you cannot raise the yield potential
[SPEAKER_00]: in those regions of sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where for smallholder farmers are
suffering from the inability to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: enough productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would say there's really two
scenarios by which we can achieve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could follow the China model,
and in China they essentially subsidized
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer production by building
fertilizer factories, producing vast
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of fertilizer that essentially
brought the cost of fertilizers down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where smallholder farmers could
afford those fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a very successful strategy
in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consequences of it is massive excess
use of nitrogen fertilizers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture I showed you is not surprisingly
from China, where massive use of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers has led to huge scales of
eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that scenario is very
unlikely, at least at the moment in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most governments in Africa cannot afford
to build large fertilizer factories to
[SPEAKER_00]: support their agricultural base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the countries that could
afford it, like Nigeria, they've got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of oil wealth, they're producing a lot of
oil wealth, there seems to be very little
[SPEAKER_00]: desire to use that oil wealth to support
their agricultural base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems, I would say, unlikely that
we're going to solve this issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen availability in sub-Saharan
Africa by just waiting for fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: prices to come down to a point that
smallholder farmers can afford them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the Gates Foundation is
funding a program that I head,
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it Engineering the Nitrogen
Symbiosis for Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is essentially asking,
can we utilize biological nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants around the, through the
evolution of plants, they've really,
[SPEAKER_00]: many organisms, many times they've
struggled with the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The availability of nitrogen is not just a
limitation in agriculture, it's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: limitation in some environments,
a number of environments in the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to succeed in those environments,
the plant has to find a way to acquire
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen by other means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example of solving that problem is
shown here, which is legumes, peas and
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, that are able to interact with
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, resulting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of these nitrogen-fixing nodules
that are essentially nitrogen factories on
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, that can deliver the full
nitrogen needs of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the question is how can we use this
nitrogen-fixing availability to address
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems in nitrogen availability in
sub-Saharan Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if we can use biological
nitrogen fixation, it provides a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable avenue for delivering
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a hugely complex process to
engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm showing you here are all the
nodules on a pea root and moving that
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer and transferring that capability,
the complexity of producing a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: novel organ into a cereal root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big challenge, and I accept that
it's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to demonstrate the opportunities
in this area, I've mocked up this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mock-up of a graph, but it is based
on real data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the x-axis is looking at
nitrogen-fertiliser application rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the y-axis we're looking at yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a familiar site.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase fertiliser use,
you increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the world average for fertiliser use
is around 130 kilograms of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the US, you're somewhat above
that, and in China, we're actually off the
[SPEAKER_00]: graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around 220 kilograms of nitrogen per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, smallholder farmers are right
at the other extreme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa
are using three to five kilograms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraordinarily low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not just nitrogen fertiliser,
that includes all their manures that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're putting very, very small levels
of nitrogen onto their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they're getting these
extremely low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this graph, I'm showing you the
region that's highlighted in blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say is a region of greatest
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legumes actually fix nitrogen around
110 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty well at the top of this
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're pretty well getting close to
the maximum potential yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to replace nitrogen
fertilisers here in the US, or anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else in the developing world agriculture,
I need to move in totality the complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: of a nitrogen-fixing p-nodule to a serial
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a context of smallholder farmers,
they're at the other extreme of this
[SPEAKER_00]: graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, relatively modest levels of
nitrogen fixation in smallholder farming
[SPEAKER_00]: systems can double or triple yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that blue window of just around 25
to 50 kilograms of nitrogen, if we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 to 50 kilograms of fixed nitrogen into
the crops of smallholder farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're looking at doubling or tripling
the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real great opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that regard, getting to that level
of fixed nitrogen, I think is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process of making a nodule is
pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty complex, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit dark on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the left, you're seeing the
mechanisms by which the bacteria infect
[SPEAKER_00]: the legume roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do so through root hairs that curl
around the bacteria that attach to the
[SPEAKER_00]: root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they form infection threads that grow
down into the root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the blue staining is the
bacteria inside the root hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will ultimately grow down all the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, you see the nodule
that's been initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light blue staining at the top is
the infection thread growing down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, the bacteria released as
infection droplets into compartments
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cells where they fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of complexity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transferring all of that complexity,
I would say, is pretty challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look in the diversity of
legumes, you actually see the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and the complexity of these
nodule structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the right is a nodule in
metacargotron catchula, which I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: is the pinnacle of this evolutionary
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see much simpler modes of bacterial
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left here is a crack entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going through root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much simpler mode of bacterial infection
that grows through where lateral roots
[SPEAKER_00]: break through the epidermis and allow the
invasion of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle are stem nodules on
Asconomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, if you actually look at these
on a surface of an Asconomy shoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would never say they're nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're swellings on the surface that have
leg hemoglobin present in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly do not reflect the
complexity that we see, say, in
[SPEAKER_00]: metacargotron catchula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think while the complexity that we
see in, say, PE or metacargo supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of nitrogen fixation,
much of that complexity is really about
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing efficiency, increasing the
efficiency of the nitrogen fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're really talking about trying
to get lower levels of nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so say in a 25 to 50 kilograms of fixed
nitrogen into smallholder farming systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we don't need all of that
complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get away with some of the much more
simpler processes that we see,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, in Asconomy or in Cespania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we'll be able to replace
nitrogen fertilizers in totality.
[SPEAKER_00]: with those kind of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can certainly deliver very useful
levels of fixed nitrogen to smallholder
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in time, I would say, in time,
we will get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe we can move nitrogen
fixing nodules into cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is just the complexity of the
process to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, I would have shocked you if
I had said I can sequence your genome in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days' time for a mere one or
$2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's become possible just in the
last 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology is advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's advancing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can't do now, we will be able to
do in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that over time, we can be
providing some level of fixed nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's useful in a smallholder farming
system and gradually getting to the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of complexity that we see in, say,
a pea or a metacargo nodule to really
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver truly replacing nitrogenous
fertilizers also here in the developed
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the shorter stage, I think we can
actually probably deliver something much
[SPEAKER_00]: more useful in the developing world than
perhaps what we might envision as in
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing fertilizers here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in order to achieve that,
I've broken it down into I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: four main steps that we have to transfer
into cereals or four main processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to transfer into cereals to get
nitrogen fixing nodules into a cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to engineer the recognition of the
rhizobial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the very first step that happens
when a legume receives the nitrogen-fixing
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and then initiates the processes
associated with accommodating those
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second stage is initiate the formation of
a nodule, so transfer the nodule
[SPEAKER_00]: organogenesis, the capability to make this
new structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third process, and probably I think one of
the most complex, is engineering the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial infection processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, but not least, is engineering
within the context of the nodule and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria present the suitable environment
for nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that those four steps,
they're four quite different steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: four quite different processes that we
need to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Gates Funded programme that
we're initiating, it's really at this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage a proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly not expecting to deliver
nitrogen-fixing cereals in two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: years, which will be the end of the first
round of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're focusing on is the very first
step, engineering rhizobial recognition
[SPEAKER_00]: into cereals and putting aside at the
moment the second, third and fourth steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: something to worry about for the future
rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first round, we need something
that's achievable, which is engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial recognition in cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that that rhizobial
recognition... Sorry, it's so dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that that rhizobial
recognition is really the key step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I can just increase the
brightness on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm at the max on my computer,
so it's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the processes of recognition that
are the means by which a plant recognises
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial bacteria, every time a seed
germinates, it has to find the rhizobial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does so through this chemical
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is releasing flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are recognised by the rhizobial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in turn initiates the production
of nod factors, which are diffusable
[SPEAKER_00]: signals coming from the rhizobial bacteria
that are perceived by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nod factors are the structure of nod
factor as it's been very well
[SPEAKER_00]: characterised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known for almost 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a chitin backbone with an acyl tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a number of other
decorations around the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the nod factor cyano rhizobium
melalotide, which is the symbiont of
[SPEAKER_00]: metacargo species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sulfated on the reducing terminal
sugar and acylated on the non-reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those modifications that differ
between the different rhizobias species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that to a degree defines the host
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, when you look across the
diversity of rhizobia, we see quite a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in these signaling molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have the chitin backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have the acyl tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a variety of modifications,
sulfation, carbonylation, fucosylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylation, et cetera, around this basic
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that differs is the
length and degree of saturation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those absolutely define the host range
of the different rhizobial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: which rhizobia bacteria interacts with
rich legume species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to understand how the plant
was perceiving that nod factor signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule, we undertook a pretty
straightforward genetic screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were just simply asking for
mutants of metacargo that were incapable
[SPEAKER_00]: to activate nodule formation in the
response to rhizobial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is essentially the basis of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dark spot on the root indicates the
place where the rhizobia were not
[SPEAKER_00]: populated on the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in a wild type plant,
you get nodules forming at that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a mutant, in this case,
an sp2 mutant, the plant is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: blind to the rhizobia bacteria and is
completely unable to initiate nodule
[SPEAKER_00]: formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of that genetic screen,
we identified a signal transduction
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway that was responsible for
perception of nod factor and transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: of that signal down to a suite of
transcription factors that are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinating gene expression associated
with nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the core of the signaling pathway,
oscillations in calcium, and I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: play you this movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a root hair cell of
metacargotron catchula that we've micro
[SPEAKER_00]: injected with a calcium responsive dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you're seeing at the moment
is just the dye relocalizing around the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we treat this root with nod
factor, you can see that the region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus begins to oscillate its calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those oscillations are predominantly in
the nucleoplasm, but they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in the nuclear-associated
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the store of the calcium is
the endoplasm in particular, but
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the region around the nuclear
envelope where the channels and pumps
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with this response are
localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that calcium oscillations will
continue for up to 24 hours while the nod
[SPEAKER_00]: factor is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's essentially transmitting the
signal saying that nod factor is
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized at the plasma membrane and
transmitting that signal into the nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: to ultimately activate the production of
the transcription factors in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the molecular view of that pathway,
essentially we've got three main complexes
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the signaling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we've got the receptor-like
kinases that are involved in perceiving
[SPEAKER_00]: the nod factor, and there's a suite of
receptor-like kinases that form a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plasma membrane that we are now
known to actually bind the nod factor
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downstream of that, there are a suite of
channels and pumps on the nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes that are associated with
producing the calcium oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then downstream of the calcium
oscillations, we have the calcium decoding
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein, CKAMK, calls calcium and
Calmodulin-independent protein kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it interacts with the transcription
factor, and in conjunction with a suite of
[SPEAKER_00]: other transcription factors, ultimately
coordinate the gene expression that's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to initiate the processes of
nodulation and bacterial infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that those calcium oscillations
are central, not only is the signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway central, but the calcium
oscillations themselves are central.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that because the gain of
functions in the protein, CKAMK,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is decoding the calcium
oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a protein that sits immediately
downstream of the calcium oscillations
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kinase with the capability to bind
both calcium on its own and then calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: in complex with Calmodulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost certainly, we know is the protein
that's decoding those calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can create gain of functions in that
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we transform those gain of
functions into the legume roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get spontaneous induction of nodules in
the absence of rhizobia or nod factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that just switching on this
protein alone is sufficient to coordinate
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole process of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generating a nodule and the whole
developmental process is associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the formation of a nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's telling us that the calcium
oscillations alone are sufficient to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you turn on this signaling
pathway, it can coordinate all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of development that's necessary
to produce this new structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we look at the evolution of this
process, nodulation, most people think of
[SPEAKER_00]: nodulation in legumes, and that's very
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is most legumes, the majority of
legumes, can nodulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nodulation is not actually restricted
to legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evolved multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red indicates a sort of groups
where nodulation has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's multiple origins of the
evolution of nodulation, but all
[SPEAKER_00]: nodulation species are restricted to the
to the uracids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a suggestion that a
predisposition event facilitated the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence or the evolution of nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, nodulation has emerged
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, nodulation has emerged
multiple times in the legume species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not a single, as far as we can
tell, either there's many, many thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants that have lost the capability to
nodulate, or more simply, probably a few
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards of 10, 12 origins of the emergence
of nodulation in the uracids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question we had was, is this
signaling process and the capability to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate calcium oscillations,
is that limited to legumes, or is it more
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly occurring in also non-nodulating,
sorry, non-legume nodulating species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the actinorhizal species,
like older trees that form nodules,
[SPEAKER_00]: not with rhizobial bacteria, but with
Francia, a filamentous nitrogen-fixing
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, we wanted to look at a number
of different species, not only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, so all the work that had been
done in the past on calcium and the
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling pathway had been restricted,
essentially, to Metacargotroncaptula and
[SPEAKER_00]: Lotus japonicus, which are the main model
legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no work had been done on the much more
primitive legumes, like Camicrysta,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a nodulating species,
or looking, for instance, at Circis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a non-nodulating legume that
diverged before the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we wanted to ask in the nodulating
non-legumes, such as in the Cannabaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Parasponia is a tree, a tropical tree,
that can interact with rhizobia and form
[SPEAKER_00]: nodules, or, for instance, older,
Alnus glutinosa, which is a non-legume
[SPEAKER_00]: that can interact with Francia bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how common was this capability to
respond to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: activate calcium oscillations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we chose this diversity of
species, and looked at their capability to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate calcium spiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, perhaps not
surprisingly, in all the legumes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the capability to activate nodulation
is broad within the legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't occur, as far as we can tell,
in Circis, which is a non-nodulating
[SPEAKER_00]: legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, Parasponia, which is the only
non-legume that can interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobia, is also activating calcium
oscillations in response to its rhizobial
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, older species, which
interact not with rhizobia, but with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Francia, and we know that these Francia
bacteria are not producing nod factor
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, they're producing a completely
different signaling molecule, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: also activating calcium oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's telling us that even though
nodulation evolved multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as we can tell, as far as we've
looked, in all the times where nodulation
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved, it's recruited this signaling
pathway and utilized the same signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms to activate the processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clear that if we wanted to
transfer this capability into cereals,
[SPEAKER_00]: this signaling pathway is central to that
process because it's been central to every
[SPEAKER_00]: case where nodulation has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say every case because there's
some cucurbits where we haven't been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the cases that we've been able to
look at, the capability to perceive the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobia bacteria and activate the
symbiosis signaling pathway is a common
[SPEAKER_00]: feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so clearly, we need to be able to
transfer this signaling capability into
[SPEAKER_00]: cereals if we're going to be able to
transfer nitrogen fixing nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say I have to recapitulate the
signaling pathway in cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a daunting challenge,
especially if you think of the complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: of activating an oscillatory calcium
behavior in your nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not like to be able to have to
engineer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, I don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because actually the
signaling pathway that we had genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: dissected in Medicargo was actually not
really a nodulation signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a mycorrhizal signaling
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the core of the signaling pathway is
what we call the common symbiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's duly required not only for the
perception of rhizobia bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also required for recognition of
our vascular mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the capability to perceive our
vascular mycorrhizal fungi goes way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the molecular viewpoint,
the common signaling components are all
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded in blue here, or the components
that we know are common to nodulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red components are the unique
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the receptor complexes, it's only the
nod factor receptors that are specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizobial recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a co-receptor called CIMRK that's
already duly required for nodulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the components that are required
for the generation of the calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations and the components that are
required for the perception of calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations are duly required for
mycorrhizae and nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only really when we start to get
to the transcription factors where we get
[SPEAKER_00]: the specificity in this process,
where the transcription factors have
[SPEAKER_00]: specific functions in nodulation and do
not appear to be predominantly involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mycorrhizal association has many
parallels to nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signaling processes in a similar
regard to nodulation, the perception of
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial bacteria, the plant is releasing
signaling molecules, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: trigalactones, and they activate the
production of diffusible signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules coming from the mycorrhizal
fungi we call myc factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar parallels to how rhizobial
bacteria are perceived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those parallels go, even greater,
but if we look at how these processes are
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved, well, nodulation emerged around
60 million years ago and was restricted to
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of groups of plants in the
urocids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbuscular mycorrhization is much more
ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dates back at least 450 million years
ago, right to the root of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all plants, this is what the blue is
indicating, all plants at least at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time had the capability to form arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that at least about 80% of
higher plants can form the arbuscular
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that can't, like Arabidopsis,
have lost that capability, but their
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors certainly had that capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, all the monocots that are
the targets for our engineering process
[SPEAKER_00]: have the capability to form the arbuscular
mycorrhizal association, and therefore we
[SPEAKER_00]: would predict, have this symbiosis
signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, this signaling pathway,
should, in theory, be in cereal crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't actually have to re-engineer
all of that complexity of producing and
[SPEAKER_00]: decoding calcium oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply have to follow the evolutionary
trajectory that's happened in legumes that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially has converted what is a
monofunctional signaling pathway into a
[SPEAKER_00]: bifunctional signaling pathway,
where we've got one signaling pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the recognition of mycorrhizal
fungi and rhizobia, whereas in cereals,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only the recognition of mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this pathway is functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so work from Uta Pashkowski's lab
has shown that this signaling pathway is
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed present in cereals, and that's
shown here with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top is a wild-type rice root
that's been colonized by mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, and all the dark blue staining is a
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets very heavily, the roots get very
heavily colonized by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we make mutations in any component
of the common symbiosis signaling pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: in rice, then the fungus can form the
initial infection structures on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, but is unable to colonize the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the same phenotypes
that we see in legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can recapitulate the mutant
phenotypes in cereals that we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, indicating that this signaling
pathway is certainly present, not only
[SPEAKER_00]: present, but it's fulfilling an equivalent
role in the recognition of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, we can actually do,
the parallels between the signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway go more significant than that,
because we can take the genes from rice
[SPEAKER_00]: and translate and trans-complement them
into the metacargomutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom panel here is a
metacargomutant of CKAMK, it's a calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: decoder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mutant cannot normally form nodules,
but when we transform it with CKAMK from
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, then it complements not only for
mycorrhization, but it also complements
[SPEAKER_00]: for nodulation, indicating that this
signaling pathway, in the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: this signaling pathway, there's nothing
that's changed in the core processes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has allowed this signaling pathway to
be bifunctional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common symbiosis signaling pathway is
there and functional, as functional in
[SPEAKER_00]: cereals as it is in legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue then that cereals have
the innate, but as yet unrecognized
[SPEAKER_00]: capability to perceive and respond to
rhizobial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And engineering that process is actually,
because of these evolutionary history,
[SPEAKER_00]: is much simpler than perhaps we would have
thought a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, for the engineering
components of that, our grant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really focusing just on the receptor
complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really need to do is to get the
receptor complexes present and functional,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the transcription factor
complexes present and functional,
[SPEAKER_00]: to transfer the capability for this
signaling pathway to be bifunctional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell us we're gonna make a
nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I accept there's a long arrow going to not
to generating the complexity of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing nodule, but as I said,
at the moment I've parked all that
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity at the moment, all we're trying
to do is transfer recognition of rhizobia
[SPEAKER_00]: as a first step towards engineering
nitrogen-fixing cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if we really want to understand
the signaling pathway in cereals,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, what we need to do is to
understand this context shown here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this is a plant root in close
proximity to mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's at this early stages where the
fungus is growing down towards the root
[SPEAKER_00]: where the signaling pathway is
functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least the first stage of where the
signaling pathway is functioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: where diffusible signaling molecules
produced by the mycorrhizal fungus are
[SPEAKER_00]: being recognized by the root, activating
that symbiosis signaling, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting the processes that are necessary
to accommodate the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first steps that we've
taken in the Gates Funded program is to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what cereals are actually
recognizing from mycorrhizal fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate that signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last few years, it was shown
that mycorrhizal fungi produce
[SPEAKER_00]: lipoketooloxacarides that are structurally
very similar to rhizobial nod factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very clear that the parallels
going of signaling, of the signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: processes are going continuously,
all the way from the signaling molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the signaling pathways,
and probably all the way through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization of the root by the rhizobial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizal fungi producing
lipoketooloxacarides structurally very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to rhizobial nod factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was proposed that those were the
myc factors that were being recognized by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the second group, also from
Toulouse, was arguing an alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis, which was that mycorrhizal
fungi produce also much simpler
[SPEAKER_00]: chytooloxacarides that are completely
undecorated, so no atrial tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the sulfation or acetylation that
you see in some of the LCOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was actually those short-chain
chytooloxacarides that were the signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways that were activated by the
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this sense, the mycorrhizal fungi
were the signaling molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the things that were activating
the symbiosis signaling pathway implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took both of these classes of
signaling molecules and asked,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are cereals recognizing, and what is
activating the symbiosis signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, we generated rice lines that
had calcium reporters, the chameleon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows us to measure calcium,
and tested an array of different signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, different LCOs, both at the top
is the mycorrhizal-produced LCOs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're testing LCOs from broad
spectrum rhizobia that produce a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of different LCO signaling
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we really do not see
any responses to the LCO signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, but we do see responses to the
chitin oligosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just shown here just in graph
form where we're looking at the percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of cells that can activate calcium
oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see really no response
whatsoever to the LCOs, but very good
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to the chitin oligosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highlight here that we're
looking at very high concentrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: these signaling molecules, 10 to the
negative 5 molar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose those concentrations simply so
that if we got a negative result,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can be very, very confident that that
plant is not responding to those LCOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we compare on the top here with two
different species of legumes, metacargo
[SPEAKER_00]: and lotus, that are showing their
responses to LCOs and COs, and the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: are two non-legumes, tomato and rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the main differences that we
see between legumes and non-legumes is a
[SPEAKER_00]: capability to respond to LCO signaling
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both non-legumes and legumes can
respond to chitin oligosaccharides and
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the symbiosis signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ability to perceive LCO seems to
be an innovation that's happened in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes and probably strongly associated
with a capability to respond to rhizobial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue that this innovation
that's happened in legumes is clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the capability to activate
nitrogen-fixing nodulation and something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we really need to be able to transfer
into non-legumes to allow recognition of
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our project, we have, as I said,
two main focuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, the engineering, the perception
of the nod factor, which is transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptors from legumes into cereals to
allow nod factor recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the second half, we're using the
gain of functions I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gain of functions in our CCAM-K.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also gain of functions in its
interacting partner, cyclops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gain of functions can coordinate the
whole processes of modulation in legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using those gain of functions in
combination with the transcription factors
[SPEAKER_00]: to activate reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very modest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My expectations at this stage are very,
very modest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we transfer nod factor activation of
calcium spiking into cereals and can,
[SPEAKER_00]: using the gain of functions in CCAM-K,
in combination with the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, activate reporters, simply legume
reporters that are reporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: nodulation-specific reporters?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we recapitulate the signaling
capability in cereals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important, I think, at this stage
that we keep our expectations modest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect to be able to transfer this
process and get a nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do keep a relatively open mind about
what will happen if we transfer the
[SPEAKER_00]: capability for cereals to recognise
rhizobial bacteria and, importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the symbiosis signaling pathway
that coordinates the processes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for a mutualistic symbiosis with
a microorganism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be that it will facilitate
improved colonisation of cereal roots by
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I doubt we'll get nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, it's just the nature
of having to go and give seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could wait a couple of years and
give this seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's too early to say what the
results are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a lot of transformation at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an awful lot of transgenic lines
coming from Bali.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some promising preliminary
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just too early to really say
definitively whether this approach has
[SPEAKER_00]: been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to highlight some of the
challenges that we have in this
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really one of the most complex
engineering processes that there is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: public sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly comparable to transferring
C4 photosynthesis which is another of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gates-funded programmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the challenges that we face in
engineering something of this level of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, I just want to reiterate we're
working on the different complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the complexes is the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to highlight again that
the co-receptor, CYMRK, which we know is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in transmitting the signal to
activation of the nuclear calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations, that co-receptor is already
present in cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already there because it's a
mycorrhizal-specific component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably it's a co-receptor with mick
factor receptors which unfortunately we
[SPEAKER_00]: currently still don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all we really need to do is to get the
nod factor receptors in a stable form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We presume they'll form a complex with
that co-receptor and therefore they should
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the nuclear calcium oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other signaling processes that we
need to transfer, not with the gain of
[SPEAKER_00]: function, we can just use the gain of
functions to auto-activate the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereals already have CYMRK but we can use
the gain of functions as a way to switch
[SPEAKER_00]: on the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing is whether we can
get these different transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes to activate their appropriate
promoters in serial routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so one of the biggest challenges in
transferring those processes, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what promoters you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do we just use 35S?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't use, we've got many genes to
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really just keep using the same
promoter again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need multiple promoters to drive the
different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exactly when we look at this,
we've got quite a few proteins to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stably present in the serial route.
[SPEAKER_00]: What level of expression of, say,
CYMRK relative to the transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we just put them all on
constitutive promoters and pray?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult thing and especially when
you don't know what the algorithm,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we get a negative result, is that
because the promoters, we're not got the
[SPEAKER_00]: right level of expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it because there's assumptions in
our process that was actually missing
[SPEAKER_00]: components that we don't know about in the
legume system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's very important, particularly when
you're setting up a large serial
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation process, that if you get a
negative result, that that negative result
[SPEAKER_00]: can be informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've at least tried, I feel like we have
to stack our cards as much as possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a positive outcome and we can overcome
any technological difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would say this is just looking at
the expression of CCAMK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its expression is normally restricted to
epidermal cells, but then when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobial colonization, and the arrow
indicates the point where rhizobia
[SPEAKER_00]: colonizing the route, that you can see
that CCAMK is expressed in a region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: route around that rhizobial colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do we recapitulate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because serials have never seen rhizobia
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the transcription factors
that coordinate this expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're moving, if you want to just
change route development, obviously you
[SPEAKER_00]: just use a route promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we're transferring a new
capability into serials, a capability they
[SPEAKER_00]: never had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there aren't any serial promoters that
will do that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what promoters should we use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is one of our
biggest challenges at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can do something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a whole panel of different
promoters we've hooked up to GUS and then
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps, should I just use the
strongest expressers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right thing to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What level of expression should a
transcription factor be to give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to other transcription factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I personally find this sort of
analysis really uninformative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we started this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, we just need to make a
lot of promoter, GUS reporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into serial routes and the ones
that are blue are the ones we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I find that very dissatisfying and
not particularly informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it, but all we have is some
routes that are blue and some routes that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would say this is probably the most
informative analysis we can get on telling
[SPEAKER_00]: us which promoters that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we've texted, these are mostly
serial promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used a variety of different serial
promoters, constitutive promoters,
[SPEAKER_00]: route-specific promoters, and then
promoters that drive, serial promoters
[SPEAKER_00]: that drive, say, CCAM-K or Cyclops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they should be already symbiotically
relevant promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've done is we've driven the
CCAM-K protein, but with these promoters
[SPEAKER_00]: and transformed those into the CCAM-K
mutant and asked how well we can
[SPEAKER_00]: complement a Medicargo CCAM-K mutant using
serial promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right here is the control,
because that's the Medicargo gene driven
[SPEAKER_00]: by its native promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's the level of complementation
that we can get just from the native
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's actually quite a
few serial promoters that do just as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not better, than the native promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those promoters were actually taken
from serials, which transformed them into
[SPEAKER_00]: a legume, and they are activating the
appropriate expression of CCAM-K.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would say that that's as good as we
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now also recapitulating this by
using those same promoters to test
[SPEAKER_00]: complementation of the rice mutant for
mycorrhization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at least it tells us that those
promoters work in a symbiotically relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: context and are expressing these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're currently doing this for
all of the genes that we're engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing, finding out which promoters are
best for which genes, at least in a legume
[SPEAKER_00]: context, which will then, I think,
at least stack our cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't guarantee we're going to get
exactly the same expression when we go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a serial, but at least we're
starting with serial promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they work in a legume in a
symbiotic context, I'm optimistic that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll work in a serial in a symbiotic
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're still shooting in the
dark a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that this is really,
I think we're still in a somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: imperfect scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from an engineering perspective,
this is a very familiar cycle from an
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to design a jet engine,
you go through this process of design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build, test, and then use the test to
inform the next design, and then build,
[SPEAKER_00]: and always improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we get these perfect jet
engines that can fly across the Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a sort of process in a sort
of, essentially, it's a synthetic biology
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to move something new from legumes
into cereals and create a new
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality in cereals that cereals do
not yet have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, on the left-hand end, the design end,
essentially, in an engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you move through this cycle
many times before you release a jet engine
[SPEAKER_00]: that you sell to Boeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to do exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just go through this cycle once,
and voila, I'm going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not how it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to move through this process many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might, in this first round of
transformations, get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might all be negative results,
in which case we have to scratch our heads
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, okay, what does that tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back, redesign, rebuild, retest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the left-hand side, which is sort of
the design and build side, we've really
[SPEAKER_00]: tackled that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, sorry, we've got Golden Gate
cloning, which is a modular mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you, you synthesise the modules,
you stitch them together to make gene
[SPEAKER_00]: modules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those themselves become modules that you
can stitch together into complex binary
[SPEAKER_00]: vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using Golden Gate cloning,
we can produce hundreds of constructs
[SPEAKER_00]: within a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trivialised the production of
constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can make many constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this modularity is actually very
important because we're testing different
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters with different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even what we're finding when we do the
same promoter testing, if we do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: with terminators, we find some terminators
work and some terminators don't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: implementations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you really need to mix and match
promoters, open reading frames and
[SPEAKER_00]: terminators, and then mix and match the
genes that go into your binary vectors in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to test as many iterations and many
possibilities as you can in this
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Golden Gate modularity has really
trivialised the production of the
[SPEAKER_00]: constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting those constructs into serials
is a huge headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have maximised our throughput into
serials and we are putting 150 constructs
[SPEAKER_00]: into serials this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do the same again next year,
another 150 constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty good in a public
sector in a couple of years getting 300
[SPEAKER_00]: constructs into serials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at what's been done in
synthetic biology in bacteria... So,
[SPEAKER_00]: I take an example, Chris Voigt just down
the road at MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's moved nitrogenase from
nitrogen-fixing bacteria into
[SPEAKER_00]: non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do so, he moved all the regulatory
elements he created his own regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: circuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he transformed that into
non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: for the capability to initiate nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To optimise, to get to a level where he's
getting back to the original levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixation that the starting
bacteria had, he had to test 80,000
[SPEAKER_00]: constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, to do that, he roboticised the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made liquid-handling robots that make
the constructs, liquid-handling robots
[SPEAKER_00]: that do the transformation,
liquid-handling robots that do the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements of the nitrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no point when any person is
actually doing any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person is... The point the person is
doing it is feeding it into a computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: is designing all the constructs or
designing the principles that then the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer design the constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80,000 constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing something much more complex
than moving nitrogenase from one bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think moving nitrogen fixation from
legumes to cereals is pretty damn complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am not tackling this at anything
close to the level of complexity that we
[SPEAKER_00]: currently need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ability to move through this
cycle, I can do it at 150 constructs a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's pretty painful going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that one of the big problems
for us in dealing with this complexity is
[SPEAKER_00]: that synthetic biology, plant synthetic
biology is just not good enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't yet have the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest bottlenecks for us
is transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one area that I think can be useful
for us and is an area we're now putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into place, I said the mycorrhizal
symbiosis is ubiquitous in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means even mosses and liverworts
do the mycorrhizal symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this guy, which is a liverwort,
Macanthia, it's an organism that's
[SPEAKER_00]: haploid, very simple genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can transform it just by grinding it
up in a tube, putting it in a liquid with
[SPEAKER_00]: agrobacterium and you plate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, you have a fully
functional liverwort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is sort of as close as I think
we're ever going to get in plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic biology and the sort of
capability where we can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: roboticize the processes and get probably
not 80,000 constructs, but at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of constructs that we can test
in a reasonable amount of time to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: test the complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is Macanthia doesn't have
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the likelihood that I'm ever going to
get a nitrogen fixing nodule onto
[SPEAKER_00]: Macanthia is very low, but it does have
the symbiosis signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at least as a framework for
engineering symbiosis signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Macanthia is a very good
framework, at least for this first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we're now in the process of
putting Macanthia as a complement to the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that we do in cereals to really start
to make this throughput much greater and
[SPEAKER_00]: to tackle it, I think, at the level that
we really need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think just ending here on,
I just want to reiterate that we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: just tackling the first stages here and
while this evolutionary trajectory,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the evolutionary trajectory makes the
first stages much simpler, it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: probably is also very clear that bacterial
infection is also reusing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that mycorrhizal fungi use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think it's very clear that the whole
process of nitrogen fixation has acerbed,
[SPEAKER_00]: has piggybacked on the mycorrhizal
symbiosis and that evolutionary trajectory
[SPEAKER_00]: means that I think it's much simpler for
us to engineer nitrogen fixation into
[SPEAKER_00]: cereals because we're not having to really
re-engineer anything new in cereals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we assert the existing biology that's
present there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even so, the complexity of the process is
such that I think we need much better
[SPEAKER_00]: plant synthetic biology tools and in some
ways, I think I have to build the bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant synthetic biology before we can
truly tackle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, for me, that's what the next
round of Gates funding is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: about, not just pushing into these other
four areas, but also putting in place the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic biology tools that allow us to
really tackle something of this
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'd just like to acknowledge the
people involved in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an international programme of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My collaborators, Jean Denarié's group in
Toulouse, have been working on the LCOs
[SPEAKER_00]: and COs and helping us to understand what
signalling molecules cereals recognise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joyce Van Eyck, who's at VTI here in
Ithaca, is helping us with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Bruttnell is also helping us with the
maize and the cereal and maize and cetaria
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then both myself and Jens Stauger,
the real engineering labs, are pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of the receptors and the
downstream calcium decoding complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just the members of my own
group who are part of the ENSA programme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also, just like before I
finish, just really acknowledge the Gates
[SPEAKER_00]: Foundation because nobody else has been
willing to take the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high-risk, high-reward project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way...
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be delivering nitrogen-fixing
cereals any time soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gates Foundation absolutely recognise it's
a long-term programme and are willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the funds up in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people will say,
it's not possible, it's too complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't possibly do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer is, if you don't start now,
you certainly will never achieve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start now, maybe there's a chance
of achieving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really acknowledge the Gates Foundation
for taking that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can repeat the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, can you do it a different
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there simpler ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, for instance, put a nitrogen-fixing
plastic, create a nitrogen-fixing plastic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the obvious thing is to move
nitrogenase from bacteria into a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's functioning already as a...
provide nitrogen fixation in a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is actually a second Gates
Foundation programme that's run by Luis
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubio in Madrid, doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to move nitrogenase,
actually, to the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they're doing the mitochondria
is there's some low oxygen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would argue with that perception that
that's simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogenase is a hugely complex enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most complex enzyme on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these unique cofactors... that are
unique to nitrogen, so you're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the components of nitrogenase
there, but you also need to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: cofactors produced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not straightforward just to move
nitrogenase over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I argue that I have the prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleckings are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fix all their nitrogens themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only Bleckings, but many different
species of plants have evolved this
[SPEAKER_00]: capability, and it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely independent nitrogen
fertilises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue that I have the advantage
of having
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transferring nitrogenase is a viable
approach, but I wouldn't say it's simpler
[SPEAKER_00]: or less obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as much riskier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen problem is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's totally legitimate to have
multiple avenues to try to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so that's a very important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I have a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is on specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a bifunctional signaling
pathway, and you get specific outputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I actually showed you that the
engagement function in CKAMK alone can
[SPEAKER_00]: activate a module, and yet when
mycorrhizal points do come along,
[SPEAKER_00]: they activate the same protein with
thousand oscillations, and you don't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: module.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, specificity is there in the
Bleckings context, that the Bleckings must
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's recognised even though it's
activated the signal pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to say, we've been working on
specificity for years, and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was encoded in the structure of
the oscillations, because we saw initially
[SPEAKER_00]: with the mycorrhizal puncture,
we saw what looked like different calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations, but actually now we're
working with the signaling molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of the oscillations is
identical between mycorrhizal signals and
[SPEAKER_00]: the signals coming from mycorrhizal
puncture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even so, we do see different gene
expression patterns to non-factor and
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal puncture that are dependent on
components in myososignal pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clear that specificity is not
because there's other signaling molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced by the microorganisms,
and that would be my argument at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still that the signals themselves are
being recognised, and the specificity is
[SPEAKER_00]: at the recognition of those molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say there's probably some
parallel signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go back to the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that there's probably not much
more than this, but there might very well
[SPEAKER_00]: be parallel signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice the grass proteins,
which are Nsp1 and Nsp2, those are grass
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that we know are important for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually don't know how they're
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One possibility is that there's parallel
signaling in those two sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to those grass proteins,
and it's a combination of the activation
[SPEAKER_00]: of those proteins in combination in the
myososignal pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that we only get modulation in
one context or combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mechanistically, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very legitimate question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can we just get
rhizobias from limiting the signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that mycorrhizal puncture are
producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually part of our strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the main reasons we're
working out exactly what serials are
[SPEAKER_00]: recognising, and the fact that they seem
to recognise in just a simple version of
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little wary to say it's just
chytolic saccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that chytolic saccharides will
activate the signaling pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we still have to use quite high
concentrations of those molecules to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much higher concentrations than we used in
the non-factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some evidence that it might be
decorated with chytolic saccharides,
[SPEAKER_00]: not decorated with an acyl tail,
but perhaps decorated with sulfation or
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonation, or with some of the other
decorations that you see on the non-factor
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have evidence it might be a
decorated chytolic saccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently testing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very much part of the reason for
understanding exactly what it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: serials recognise in mycorrhizal puncture,
because a much simpler strategy would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to engineer rhizome just to make a lot of
that signal, and therefore presumably be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to colonise those.
I have two sort of related questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a guess at a timeline as to how
long you think this might take you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be curious to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question is, do you
envision that you would have to
[SPEAKER_01]: co-inoculate with a rhizobium species,
or do you think that engineered serials
could make use of the natural rhizobia in
the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both very good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've heard those questions
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question, I've got to say I
hate that first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are we going to get natural
phytonutrients in serials?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an incredibly difficult
question to answer, because if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really moving into the unknown,
we don't quite know how much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity that's present in that we need
to transfer into serials, and exactly when
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point for highlighting in the
beginning, I think there's opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: along the process that perhaps we can
deliver useful levels of fixed nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be hugely beneficial to small
farmers well before we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing fertilisers here in the
developed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm optimistic that we can be there,
at least within my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's not mine while waiting for
many future generations to solve this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm optimistic that we can at least be
delivering some level of useful fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen within the next 20 years,
whether that's in the context of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: fully functional P nodule on a cereal
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's optimistic to say we
can do that in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also would say technology is moving
very quickly, and particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic biology, synthetic biology tools
are coming into place that I think make it
[SPEAKER_00]: much more feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have to be reasonably open
minded how long this is really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second question is, would we have
to go in, I guess, with an inoculum,
[SPEAKER_00]: or can we just get them to use the native?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very hard to imagine how we
could engineer it for the native rhizome
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the cereal, at least at this
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to know what the signaling
molecules are produced by the rhizome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in the first instance,
it would probably require an inoculum,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at least then you've got control
both on the plant side and the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the bacteria are producing the
signal that you've engineered the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is there something
intrinsic to cereal that stops them from
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to be involved in the process,
and why is cereal not at this capability?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not that, I mean,
if you look at the evolution, cereals just
[SPEAKER_00]: diverged well before modulation emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the simplest reason to say
why cereals don't have the capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't evolve early enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in agriculture we've
created a situation where plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity is highly dependent on
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an animal system where we
strip everything, all the plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: off the soil, and then come back the next
year and plant new seeds and expect to get
[SPEAKER_00]: high productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no system, natural systems,
that are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've created a system that's hugely
dependent on always adding back the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A natural system has a much more natural
nutrient cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many environments, fixing nitrogen
is not the be all and end all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, when you look at legumes,
where they succeed tend to be in places
[SPEAKER_00]: where nitrogen is limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short grasslands, acidic soils,
tropical soils, that are very low
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I would say that in the natural
world, nitrogen, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some contexts, is the major factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in many contexts, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily have to solve
that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across the spectrum, there are many
different examples where plants have found
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways of solving this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for cereals, probably in a
natural context, it's not the be all and
[SPEAKER_00]: end all for their competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereals tend to grow in areas where
nitrogen is not that limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say it's not that there's
something intrinsic to cereals that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're softening in order to modulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it just doesn't happen in
their lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've created a false alarm where
nitrogen is the key factor to our
[SPEAKER_00]: argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I was going to work on
anything, if I had a choice, I'd work on
[SPEAKER_00]: caxifonia because it's probably the most
recently evolved example of modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also probably the most simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crack entry, the bacteria,
again, in my infection threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get released into, they stay in
infection threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fix nitrogen inside the infection
threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as I can tell, it's also very
clearly a modified natural root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a complex module.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say if I was going to try to
artificialize anything in caxifonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic dissection, modulation in
caxifonia, a tropical tree that takes
[SPEAKER_00]: years to grow, it's just not realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I have to work with a system by
which I can genetically dissect this
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and that is the model I can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has yet to be an actualized
species that's being developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to dissect the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it is something there in a
multi-factor species working, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a model actualized species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm too far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for that to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got enough information by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's clear, at least from the
signaling pathway, it's the same signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can pretty well say probably
similar things have happened in an
[SPEAKER_00]: actualized species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that the question is,
is there a yield penalty when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing serous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a really easy answer for
smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right at the bottom of that curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a field of base in Africa,
it's yellow most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their photosynthetic capacity is being
limited by the availability of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there, they're so far down
on the levels of nitrogen that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available that there's no way,
even if you're having to fix your own
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, you are pushing productivity up
significantly because you're starting from
[SPEAKER_00]: such a low base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That argument becomes important when
you're starting to say, can we totally
[SPEAKER_00]: replace nitrogen fertilizers with
biological nitrogen fixation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that regard, yes, I'm sure there is
a yield penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to think about both the
environmental sustainability and the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic sustainability of the current
model where we're using the best amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average farmer is spending,
certainly in the UK, about 40% sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: production costs for the purchase and
application of nitrogen fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue you take 20% yield
penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still economically viable,
and it's a lot more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there is a yield penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect there will be a yield penalty,
but you're probably not going to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: yield penalty until you get upwards of 70,
80 kilograms of fixed nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my argument, certainly in a
situation where you find your first
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers are might be too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three lysine recetaline,
oh, sorry, two lysine recetaline kinases
[SPEAKER_00]: in all of that content here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, two, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few other lysine proteins that
have just lysine domains, but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: recetaline kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the process of getting
generative mutants, and there's two lysine
[SPEAKER_00]: recetaline kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm guessing they're both nucleotide
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it took us a while to actually get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Macantia polymorpha,
which is the model that's being developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a non-microlysis species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who develops a model plant seems
to manage to find the one, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the few 20% plants that don't
form microlysis in biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to develop a new microlysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macantia model, which we've chosen that
Palaeaceae, which is a close relative of
[SPEAKER_00]: microlysis, and then we had to set up all
the transformation tools in that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have transformation working,
so we're now getting a catheter CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: working in that, in order to then to start
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the SYN pathway's all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it all synthesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the process of testing
transcomponentation in the cargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing it's going to be the same as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that the SYN pathway
coming from Fisca mitrella can transmit
[SPEAKER_00]: the SYN pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue discussion over
refreshments.
