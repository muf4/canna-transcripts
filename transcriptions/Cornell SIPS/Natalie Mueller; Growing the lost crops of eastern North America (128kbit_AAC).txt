[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to be here this afternoon
and share a little bit of what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at Cornell for the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Don just gave an introduction to
what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an anthropologist by training and I'm
taking advantage of this opportunity that
[SPEAKER_00]: the NSF offers for social scientists to
gain experience in fields outside of their
[SPEAKER_00]: major field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever I talk about the lost
crops of Eastern North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: it requires a lot of exposition because
most people have never heard of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of start at the
beginning and give you a little brief
[SPEAKER_00]: interview or interview introduction to how
archaeologists convinced ourselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: others that these are indeed lost crops,
that some of them were domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take you through some aspects of
my dissertation research that led me to
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions that I have about the role
of plasticity in domestication,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I'm exploring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end I'll show you some of the
very kind of preliminary observations or
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things that I've been doing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are still in the field right
now, so we'll be harvesting them soon and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll have more results for this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been trained in is
paleoethnobotany, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-discipline of archaeology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleo obviously stands for old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I analyze ancient plant remains that are
recovered from archaeological sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually in my case seeds and fruits,
but other small fragments of plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethno is people, so ethnobotanists talk to
people a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes talk to people, but because I
study ancient agriculture, I more often
[SPEAKER_00]: will read historical and ethnographic
records to understand how agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then botany I don't think really needs
an introduction in this crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of give you an intro to
how we get the types of plant remains that
[SPEAKER_00]: I analyze or that I specialize in,
it's extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a method called flotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically when we find contexts where
plant remains are likely to be found,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this hearth, which the flotation
sample has already been removed from,
[SPEAKER_00]: this floor that has tiny pieces of
charcoal embedded in it, or this area
[SPEAKER_00]: around a grindstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seem like good places to find plant
remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a soil sample and we process it by
flotation, which basically just means that
[SPEAKER_00]: we pour it into a bucket or a bin of
water, agitate it, and then pour off the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material that floats to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what my students are doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're skimming the organic material into
a cheesecloth, which we then dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bring it back to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully once we've picked out all the
sort of roots and modern seeds and things
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sample that are not of interest
to us, what we're left with is ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: plant remains that were left behind by
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I study domestication,
I usually take this one step further and
[SPEAKER_00]: take micro photographs or some sort of
images of these seeds and fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then analyze them to see if there's
been any change over time in the size and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the fruits, or if there's any
differences geographically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens to be the species that I
studied for my dissertation, just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you an idea of kind of what my data looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variability, obviously,
but there's also variability in how well
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all exceptionally well
preserved, which is why I bothered
[SPEAKER_00]: photographing them in the first place,
but you can see that they're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so another big aspect of what I do is
kind of trying to reconstruct what they
[SPEAKER_00]: look like before they were burned and
buried in the ground for 2,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not really gonna talk much about
how we do that today, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually very boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So domestication is what I specialize in,
and the way that I define that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: coevolutionary relationship where human
practices are changing the bodies and
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors of plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if it's a coevolutionary
relationship, I strongly believe that our
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with these plants and
animals are also changing our bodies and
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors over the course of thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why I chose these two images
to represent domestication is because
[SPEAKER_00]: these were two very simple experimental
projects that taught us very important
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons about how to make domestication
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of Balayev's fox
experiments, what he did was he just
[SPEAKER_00]: selected wild foxes on one specific trait,
which was lack of aggression towards
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ended up happening over the
course of several generations is that a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole suite of other traits that our
domesticated mammals share, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter birth intervals, piebald codes,
floppy ears, all these different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that many of our domesticated animals
have, ended up kind of coming along with
[SPEAKER_00]: just the selection for that one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the implications of this have been
really important, and people are still
[SPEAKER_00]: doing research about how that works in our
domesticated mammals today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Hillman's experiments with wheat
showed that if you exert really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: selective pressure on wild wheat through
harvesting methods, you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticate it very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both cases, it was a very simple
experiment that showed us something really
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental about domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've really taken a lot of inspiration
from studies like these in my own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Eastern Agricultural
Complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, Eastern is referring to
Eastern North America, east of the Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the plants that people grew
here in pre-Columbian times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these crops, obviously,
are familiar to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize, beans, and squash were and continue
to be extremely important to indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are from Eastern North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the wild progenitors of these plants
are not from Eastern North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were first domesticated in what is
now Mexico, and they reached the region
[SPEAKER_00]: where I work, around 900 AD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incidentally, it was probably a little bit
earlier in New York, but that's a story
[SPEAKER_00]: for another day and quite mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that were domesticated in
Eastern North America from native wild
[SPEAKER_00]: progenitors are other squashes,
like acorn squash and sunflower that we
[SPEAKER_00]: still grow today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other five plants on this slide
are the lost crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the species that I'm studying
and that I'm growing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, they're sort of in
chronological order here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From when they entered the crop system,
so these were the earliest, followed by,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both fall-maturing pseudo-serials,
so non-grass seed crops, to
[SPEAKER_00]: spring-maturing grasses, and then
arachnoid weed entered the crop system
[SPEAKER_00]: last, probably around 2,500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area where we have really good
evidence that these plants were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the core area because there's
not a good name for it in like 21st
[SPEAKER_00]: century geography, like it's not really
the Midwest, it's not exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast, but it made a lot of sense as a
region to ancient people because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically centered on the
Mississippi River and includes most of its
[SPEAKER_00]: important northern tributaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's two highland areas that
are on the periphery of this core area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've been really important because
we get better preserved plant remains from
[SPEAKER_00]: caves and rock shelters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the evidence that I'll
talk about and all of the evidence that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have that we can get ancient DNA out of
comes from these peripheral highlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start talks about this that
aren't for archaeologists by just
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining how we know that these are lost
crops so that everyone doesn't spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time on talking being skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started with flotation in the
1960s, and one of the first things that
[SPEAKER_00]: archaeologists started to notice is they
would excavate contexts like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the bottom of a storage pit,
the last 10 centimeters or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are just this dense layer of burnt
plant remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, what this turned out to
be was a homogeneous mass of millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: arachnot weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is one of the assemblages that I
analyzed for my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can also tell you that it's from a
domesticated population, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent line of evidence that these
were cultivated plants, and I'll talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even just from the context,
this is not the kind of thing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect to find if people just had
these plants growing around and were
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we would expect to
find when people are storing seeds to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: them and to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have even more unambiguous
evidence of seed storage from contexts,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, on those peripheral areas where we
have dry caves and rock shelters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe my favorite artifact ever is this
beautiful bag from Eden's Bluff in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arkansas that's full of the seeds of
domesticated quinoa cousin in Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this bundle of Maygrass is also
from Arkansas, and it looks like I could
[SPEAKER_00]: have harvested it a couple years ago,
but actually it's about 2,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have evidence not only that people
are storing these plants, but that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: storing their seeds in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably both, but we know they were
eating them, and based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication syndromes that we see,
we can be fairly sure that they were also
[SPEAKER_00]: planting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gets to consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a human, a 3,000-year-old human
feces, human poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of sealed the deal,
I think, for convincing archaeologists in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late 1960s and early 1970s that these
were, in fact, crops that people were
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This archaeologist, Patty Jo Watson,
led excavations of salts in Mammoth Cave,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are these deep, dry caves in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the many things that they found
down there were human feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have been directly dated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 3,000 years old, and they're full
of the seeds of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, if you didn't believe that
they were eating the seeds before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're convinced now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of simultaneously,
archaeologists started to send these plant
[SPEAKER_00]: remains to botanists, because back then,
there really wasn't any such thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: paleoethanobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally, these plant remains that
were coming out of archaeological sites
[SPEAKER_00]: were analyzed by botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they referred back to
this early literature by people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Harlan and his colleagues about
domestication syndromes in annual plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and say, OK, is there anything
about these seeds that were getting out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the archaeological record that would
indicate that they were domesticated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't see all of these things in
normal archaeological samples that we get,
[SPEAKER_00]: like growth habit or increase in seed set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that are really hard to see in
the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some things that we can see,
usually, if we have well-preserved seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or fruits, such as non-shattering,
greater seed size, loss or reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: germination inhibitors, and loss of blooms
and other appendages that would make it
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to process or digest seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these botanists and eventually
archaeologists that were trained as
[SPEAKER_00]: paleoethanobotanists started to document
these changes in the archaeological
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, sumpweed is the common name
for iva annua.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from their sort of wild
comparative collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 3 by 3 millimeters as a normal
size for a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see sort of from the
older, these dates are a little bit wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is an old paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the late archaic going up to the
Mississippian, increases in seed size over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, resulting in giant seeded iva annua
by about 1,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three to four times bigger than it
would be in a wild population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed size is the key criteria for
identifying domesticated assemblages of
[SPEAKER_00]: iva, which will become important later in
this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Kena podium, the key characteristic,
although there are others, is a reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in the thickness of its testa,
which makes it germinate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing these are old species
names, but basically different native
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes of wild Kena podium with a
thick testa, like 40 to 60 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for comparison, Chia,
which is a domesticated Kena podium that's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this archaeological assemblage
from Russell Cave, which has even thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: testa than our modern domesticated Chia
down in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is for this species that
key criteria is that reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: germination inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slightly less well known is
little barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several archaeologists have argued that
little barley was also domesticated either
[SPEAKER_00]: in the southwest or in the southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the argument that they make is a
little bit complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are experimentally burned seeds
that I burned myself this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in various states of Andras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that after they've been
burned, you still have the chaff adhering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have the paleo and lemma,
the glooms, whatever, adhering to the
[SPEAKER_00]: karyopsis, the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true if you try to process
little barley in various ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: like soaking it, grinding it, pounding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get everything off of
that grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the archaeological record,
we only find these grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never find chaff, which is actually
really mysterious and weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's been fully
explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a partial explanation for it is that
there used to be a naked variety of little
[SPEAKER_00]: barley domesticated, like naked barley in
the old world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty convinced by this argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we could keep doing more
research about it, because it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: weird that we don't find chaff when
everyone else in the world does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of where things stood in
terms of domestication research when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing this in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had really clear, good, accepted
evidence that sumpweed and kena podium
[SPEAKER_00]: were both domesticated based on changes in
seed size and germination inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pretty solid argument that little
barley was as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had lots of evidence that
magras was cultivated for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: even outside of its natural range,
but no sort of morphological indicators
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was arachnotweed,
which was mysterious and kind of up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air when I started doing this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first heard about this mystery when I
was working in the lower Illinois Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a really beautiful region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some of the most productive and
valuable farmland in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of looking out over the
floodplain from the bluff, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: this little site is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this site was somebody's house,
just one family's house about 1,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that they were
growing was arachnotweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this assemblage of arachnotweed was
really, really weird looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the obvious thing that's weird
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really have time to talk about
sprouts today, but if there's anyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience that studies sprouts,
I would love to discuss it, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that one way that this plant may
have been processed to make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritious and easier to eat, basically,
would be to sprout it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were other things that were
strange about this arachnotweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the botanists that analyzed it in the
1980s basically said, this doesn't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like anything in our comparative
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly doesn't look like
arachnotweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either it's a domesticated form of
arachnotweed, or else there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: missing from our comparative collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, this is how it stood for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I saw this as working on my
master's, I was like, wow, this is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: neat little question I can investigate for
my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was actually a lot harder to answer
this question than I anticipated that it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be, as it usually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ended up being able to convince
myself, and then eventually a panel of
[SPEAKER_00]: anonymous botanists, that there was,
in fact, an extinct domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies of arachnotweed in Eastern
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type specimen for this comes from
one of those rock shelter collections in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the course of doing this research
and convincing myself that this was really
[SPEAKER_00]: a domesticated population was when I first
became interested in plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was taking seed samples from
many different species of polygonum first,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing how there was a ton of
variability within and between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, once I'd established
for myself that I was working with
[SPEAKER_00]: arachnotweed, from arachnotweed that was
growing in a lot of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: habitats and different places,
and then eventually I was cultivating it
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to notice that there's a lot
of variability in what I was seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of seed morphology, depending on
what was going on with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first, I'll admit that I was just
annoyed by plasticity, or I saw it as
[SPEAKER_00]: noise, and I wanted to be able to
eliminate it as a possible explanation for
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was seeing in the archaeological
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I continued to study it longer and
longer, I started to think that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly be important for why this plant
was domesticated, for how this plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to explain why I think that,
or using this as an example, I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain some things about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unless there's weed scientists in
the room, people probably aren't familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it fruits and flowers all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a typical summer plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has pretty much mature fruits,
maturing fruits and flowers all on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before it dies,
it does this thing where it does a big
[SPEAKER_00]: bout of simultaneous fruiting,
and then the whole plant is covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, which is nice if you're a farmer
and you're growing it for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing about this plant
that you need to understand is that under
[SPEAKER_00]: normal conditions in its wild state,
it produces two different kinds of fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dimorphic akin, akin is a type of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces this one, the tuber cold
morph, all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to harvest all of the seeds
off of a plant in summer, they would all
[SPEAKER_00]: be this morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts to produce these in the
fall, but these are still adhering to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and they're still being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any typical harvest that you take in
October or November is going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of both of these from a normal
wild population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just like micro photographs of the
thickness of the pericarp, just to quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: show the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had a better image,
like from an ACM or something of the tuber
[SPEAKER_00]: cold morph, you could see that it also has
layers of wax, which keep water from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the seed and also
mechanically restrict the germination of
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weird thing about the domesticated
assemblages that we find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: archaeology record, there's two
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, there are no tuber cold
morphs that are completely missing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least there are very, very few of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the smooth morphs are bigger than
you would really expect them to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite animation, which I've been
using that for years, which is a classic
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator of domestication in annual seed
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this disappearance of the tuber cold
morphs is important from the perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: of farming this crop or from the
perspective of domestication because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a really clear germination
heteromorphism between these fruit types
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, as you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smooth morphs germinate more readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these experiments, these seeds were
subjected to sort of standard simulated
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were in moist substrate at four
degrees Celsius for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that treatment, with some
exceptions, I get pretty good germination
[SPEAKER_00]: from the smooth morphs, but the tuber cold
morphs, that's not enough for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another difference between them,
is that they also grow more slowly once
[SPEAKER_00]: they germinate, probably because less of
the volume of fruit is made up of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritive material that the seedling is
using for its early growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just visualizing that in a more
quantitative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number of leaves and height as indicators
of how big the plants are at different
[SPEAKER_00]: times in the first five weeks of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this becomes important because if you
have human cultivators coming in and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning out stands of arachnotweed at any
point during the first five weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, they're going to remove more of
the seedlings that come from those tuber
[SPEAKER_00]: cold morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plant in the previous
generation that produced a ton of mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth morphs, more of its offspring are
going to survive this kind of an activity
[SPEAKER_00]: by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, maybe people were thinning or
maybe they weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most gardeners do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most farmers in the past that practiced
scatter seeding did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of arachnotweed,
I think it's even more likely that people
[SPEAKER_00]: were thinning because there's a huge
difference in terms of yield depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason why is because the
plant produces seeds in the axils of its
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more highly branched it is,
the more seeds it produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you have more than twice
as much seed and basically the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of space as these 20 plants produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just showing that relationship
where the less dense the plants are,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more branches they have and then the
more seeds they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting because in a
typical wild stand, you're a very very
[SPEAKER_00]: dense populations of arachnotweed because
they drop hundreds of seeds right
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's giving ancient
people too much credit to suppose that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have noticed that thinning out
a stand like this could double their
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, right, in the course of a single
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a pretty neat little
story of how domestication occurred and we
[SPEAKER_00]: see this really strong like kind of
beautiful trend with only a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird things going on where you have your
modern comparative sample here and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: chronological order you have fruits
getting bigger until the very end when
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some feralization is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these open circles indicate the
smooth morse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these later assemblages are almost
completely composed of smooth morse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ignore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is a really kind of
classic like case of domestication,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with this neat story is
that in the course of doing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: growing arachnotweed and looking at it and
the wild and stuff, I noticed some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that made me think that this might not be
the end of the story or it might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to think that plasticity
might be a really important part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to look to what people had
been writing about plasticity and
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, because I'm an
anthropologist, I started with
[SPEAKER_00]: anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our most beloved theorists of
domestication and anthropology is Mindy
[SPEAKER_00]: Zader, who works on animal domestication
in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been saying for, you know,
it's been general, the reason why I have
[SPEAKER_00]: Putin riding the bear up here is because,
you know, it's generally accepted,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has been for a long time, that some
animals are more domesticable than others,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a reason why we don't have
domesticated bears, although it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic if we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Mindy has been arguing for a long
time is that rather than saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this animal is domesticated when we
see a difference in its skeleton in the
[SPEAKER_00]: archaeological record, we should look at
behavioral indicators because there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of animals that were being penned,
were being bred in captivity or ridden or
[SPEAKER_00]: milked or any number of really important
behavioral things before we can see any
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological evidence from their bodies
that they were domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started thinking, okay, what's the
equivalent to these kinds of pliability
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see in our domesticated animals in
the plant world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started reading what evolutionary
biologists have been writing about
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity and evolution and realized that
we're in the middle of a big to-do about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, with some biologists arguing,
that the modern synthesis needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be revised and updated in this
extended evolutionary synthesis to put
[SPEAKER_00]: more emphasis on plasticity, epigenetics,
and niche construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just from one of the papers,
you know, and sort of arguing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at three different genotypes,
and they're what's called reaction norms
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to two different environmental
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you just kind of a concrete
example and a really easy to see one from
[SPEAKER_00]: erect knotweed, we've got these two
populations, same time of year,
[SPEAKER_00]: only like an hour drive away from each
other, and this one's like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: unbranched herb, and then my plants that I
was growing in the garden are like giant
[SPEAKER_00]: woody shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a sort of unresolved question with this
whole how important is developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity in evolution question is how
does something that's originally plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: become fixed, which is genetic
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that become a fixed trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the mechanisms that underlie
genetic assimilation, if and when it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens, are really poorly understood,
and I really think that domesticates are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the best way to get to the
bottom of this, because with domesticates,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have before and after, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the wild progenitor, and we have
the domesticate that came from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at traits that are
originally plastic, and then that have
[SPEAKER_00]: become fixed in our domesticates,
and try to understand how that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example, just you know, there are
other studies I could point to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is one that I like and I think is
cool, is manioc, which in its wild state
[SPEAKER_00]: can be either a shrub or a vine,
depending on whether it's growing in an
[SPEAKER_00]: open or a closed canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its domesticated state, it can still be
a shrub or a vine, but it's much less good
[SPEAKER_00]: at being a vine, and frequently it breaks
and falls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's lost some of that plasticity that
it had in its wild state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So according to theorists of genetic
assimilation, in order for this to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a plastic trait, obviously,
something in the environment that changes
[SPEAKER_00]: permanently, because at least
hypothetically, if the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to be unpredictable,
then it will continue to be good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to be able to have these two
different phenotypes, and some kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary cost associated with
maintaining plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the non-plastic genotype is better than
the plastic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take this example of the
dimorphism, the fruit dimorphism,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two different types, tubercle and
smooth morphs, the first question to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is this plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I discovered that it was completely by
accident when my first experiment with
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant pretty much utterly failed,
because I was interested in what was
[SPEAKER_00]: causing this dimorphism and blah,
blah, blah, and I grew these plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse where they were subjected to 16
hours of light and eight hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness, no matter what season it was,
and direct unlimited light right above
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was they didn't ever
produce any smooth morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just produced tubercle morphs,
and it was a monomorphic assemblage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite of the domesticated ones that
we're finding in the archaeological
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely is plastic, and the first
thing I decided to investigate is what
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to do with light, so just ignore
how really messy this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My redo of this experiment this year is
much nicer looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a first try, it gave me some good
data, and I grew the arachnotweed outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I had a shady and a sunny
treatment to see if it was day length,
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly day length, or light availability
in general that had something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of these two different
morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found again is that,
yes, it's plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are significant differences between
the percentage of one morph or the other
[SPEAKER_00]: that are produced by plants grown in the
shade versus the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shady plants produce more of the
smooth morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, in general, the garden-grown
plants produce more of the smooth morphs
[SPEAKER_00]: than any of the wild populations that I've
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in particular, these are all individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three plants that produce over 90%
smooth morphs, if I found those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: archaeological record, I would say that
they were domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's outside the range of variability
that I've documented in wild populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is going on with these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're growing in a garden,
but it's not a particularly well-tended
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not sure what is causing this
level of plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there an evolutionary cost to
maintaining plasticity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I think I've already talked about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are coming through and thinning
out those plants, they're going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: an advantage to plants that produce more
of these smooth morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just showing the same thing
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, are the populations subjected to
new environmental conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question you have to answer first
is, where would they be growing if they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't in cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually a really complicated
question, because the landscape in my
[SPEAKER_00]: study area has changed so dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it could be a whole other talk,
like, how do we reconstruct where these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were before the entire Midwest was
taken over by industrial food production?
[SPEAKER_00]: But where they grow today are in these
highly disturbed, frequently flooded creek
[SPEAKER_00]: banks and floodplains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use this as an example, because it
illustrates why I think, and this has been
[SPEAKER_00]: theorized by plant biologists,
why this plant has two different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows in an unpredictable environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes what happens is these plants
were coming up in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just had their very first little
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a week later, there was a really
extreme flood that scoured the river bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was underwater for over a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back there in October,
all of that generation of plants had been
[SPEAKER_00]: wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, the following year, the population
was back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those tubercle morphs that don't
germinate very readily, they're a bet
[SPEAKER_00]: hedging mechanism so that the population
can recover after a catastrophic event,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in theory, dormancy strategies
like arachnotweed and other plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: have this kind of germination
heteromorphism have this strategy of
[SPEAKER_00]: escaping from unfavorable periods in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sampling different growing seasons,
whereas plants that have a very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersal mechanism are sampling different
locations in the same season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these could be seen as sort of
alternative ways of dealing with risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stands to reason that if
arachnotweed obtained a new dispersal
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, its existing dormancy strategy
would become less important for its
[SPEAKER_00]: survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are populations subjected to new
environmental conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say based on the archaeological
record, we can say that yes, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that people were taking these plants
up out of the floodplain and clearing
[SPEAKER_00]: locations on terraces that would otherwise
be stable forest ecosystems to grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that they were storing the
seeds and keeping them safe, which
[SPEAKER_00]: provides an alternative to storage in the
soil seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, that those tubercle
morphs are no longer necessary for the
[SPEAKER_00]: survival population because it's living in
a more stable environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of thinning and cultivation
behavior, they're actually detrimental to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm discovering all this stuff about
arachnotweed and thinking, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe genetic assimilation is part of the
story of how this plant was domesticated,
[SPEAKER_00]: my colleagues were coming to similar
conclusions about two of the other lost
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my colleague, Liz, is working growing
all the lost crops in her garden down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in particular, she was noticing some
fishy business with iva annua,
[SPEAKER_00]: sumpweed, which you can see is dwarfing
her in her garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a normal height for iva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my colleague, Paul, and his students
were growing kena podium at Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: University and also sampling from a lot of
different wild populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basis of our project about
plasticity and domestication rested on
[SPEAKER_00]: three observations that were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liz, in her garden, noticed that over the
course of four growing seasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: the iva started to spontaneously produce
bigger seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was without any kind of selection for
bigger seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't planting them deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't doing any of the things that we
thought for generations caused the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in seed size in our domesticated
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, again, if we found these seeds in
the archaeological record, we would say
[SPEAKER_00]: they were borderline domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely above the cutoff for
what we've considered to be domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: iva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already talked a lot about knotweed,
so I'm not going to belabor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if I found these particular
plants in the archaeological record,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say, based on the criteria
that I myself just made up, that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hate to contradict myself so soon,
but we may need to either rethink how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're defining domestication or rethink
our criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, with kena podium,
what we're finding is that we knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these seeds that have thin testas
occur naturally in wild populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can sort of see them with your
naked eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that show up as red or yellow
instead of black, they have thinner testa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're seeing harvesting from more
different populations of kena podium is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, actually, it can be up to 50% of
wild plant can spontaneously have these
[SPEAKER_00]: thin testas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we want to figure out,
well, first of all, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: kena podium, because it's a mess,
just in terms of the species delegations
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that, but also what sorts
of environmental conditions may be causing
[SPEAKER_00]: this variability that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three projects make up this
larger project, the Pallet for Selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are doing in collaboration with
Logan Kistler at the Smithsonian National
[SPEAKER_00]: Museum of Natural History.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part of it that I'm currently
executing right now is the polygonum
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm redoing that messy looking
experiment that I showed you from St.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis with the sun in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are taking RNA samples from the
leaves, flowers, and developing fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks so that we can try and see
at what point this trigger happens where
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants start producing these smooth
morts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's happening more so or earlier
in one treatment versus the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good sort of way to transition
into talking a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular facets of Paleoethanabotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is changing really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ancient DNA, especially human ancient DNA
research has exploded exponentially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that we're going to see a
similar kind of explosion of research in
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient plant DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far in Eastern North America,
there's already been some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been based on chloroplast DNA so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly what it's been used for is
biogeography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So studies of what ancient populations of
squash and how they're related to modern
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of squash and this really cool
mystery about bottle gourds and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up getting from Africa to North
America 10,000 years ago, which is a story
[SPEAKER_00]: for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then biogeography proving that or
demonstrating that Kena podium was
[SPEAKER_00]: independently domesticated in Eastern
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing for sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So molecular backup for those being from
Eastern North America as opposed to some
[SPEAKER_00]: other region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most recently, chloroplast DNA
has been used to look at sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity in the ancient biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this study just came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite paper of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's showing a couple, a few ancient
genomes in here, or ancient plastomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, and a lot of historical and
ethnographically known sunflower landraces
[SPEAKER_00]: and modern cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of really interesting
things in this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to just go read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I really like about it
is that it's showing, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've even compared to, we know we've
lost a lot of agro-biodiversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even compared to that, there still are
even more ancient losses that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these sort of types is not
represented, one of the ancient types is
[SPEAKER_00]: not represented in any of the modern
samples that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that ancient people were
cultivating more than one landrise in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same place, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's to be expected, but it's nice
to have proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ancient epigenomics is just kind of
getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, has mostly been deployed on
humans, not plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But could be really cool way to explore
plasticity in plant domestication as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNA has been extracted from ancient
maze kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylomes have been reconstructed for
ancient humans and relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how useful this is going to
be for plant domestication since most of
[SPEAKER_00]: our well-preserved DNA comes from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds are inherently not really doing
much before they germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, maybe we can come up with
some applications for this going forward
[SPEAKER_00]: as our methods improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing that's starting to
come out of the ancient DNA research with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is looking at kind of these deep
histories of plants and their evolution in
[SPEAKER_00]: human communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sorghum, both these studies are
about sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of showing how the major
landraces of sorghum are correlated with
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnolinguistic groups across the African
continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of looking at the connections
between human cultural movements and their
[SPEAKER_00]: action on the one hand and
agrobiodiversity on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's looking at a huge amount of
ancient plant genomes in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's showing is that these really
well-differentiated landraces that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: in sorghum are probably pretty recent
because all of the ancient genomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of falling into this undifferentiated
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other conclusions in this
paper that I don't have time to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically indicate that sorghum,
the bottleneck, that where sorghum lost
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity with respect to its wild
ancestor didn't occur at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: its domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurred thousands of years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of contradicting what we
have thought about domestication in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's highlighting the importance of,
instead of looking at domestication like,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we've identified when this was
domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have like when the early
botanists went out and collected and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in between is just a wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of kind of evolution and
different trajectories that were happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in between those two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're looking at in
this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go ahead and show you
some of the other things that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, I don't have like concrete
results yet because we're still doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we're looking
at is how to get these things to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy to get wild plants to
germinate in comparison to crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably something that ancient
people struggled with when they started to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually plant these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started over the winter with just
doing like simulated winter treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we could figure out how to even
get any of the seeds to germinate for our
[SPEAKER_00]: big experiments this spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this winter, we're going to do some
other things to try and get better
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a practical standpoint,
this is important because if other people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to pick this up and do research
about it, they have to be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these things to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really can slow down the
experiments or ruin them if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see like this experiment
that I spent such a long time sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up is right here, back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority of the area that we're
cultivating is actually what I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: calling general experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at there is just
the effects of multi-cropping and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing on yield and just plant health,
plant size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we think based
on historically known and currently
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted Native American agriculture is
that it's probably a multi-crop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't very much monocropping going
on in the New World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what kind of synergies there may
have been between these plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, we don't know how well they would do
with each other versus if they're grown by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took this picture because these are
the two oldest lost crops, Kenopodium and
[SPEAKER_00]: Iva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow in very similar types of
environments naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem to be doing very well
together out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what kind of yields we get
from them when they're in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: community versus by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is something that I haven't
really had time to circle back to in like
[SPEAKER_00]: months because I've been out in the field
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're taking these kind of overhead
shots of the plots every week so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can hopefully get the computer to learn
how to pick out the different species and
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate how much of the canopy they're
making up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know some people here do that because
I've seen posters around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone has good ideas for me about
how to operationalize that, I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we noticed some kind of
strange things about the lost crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will just be my final kind of
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Maygrass, which I haven't said
really anything about, is called Maygrass
[SPEAKER_00]: because it produces seeds in May,
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it produces seeds in like mid-June
because it doesn't usually grow in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, it produces seeds in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some archaeologists have been
wondering for years if it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to get two crops out of Maygrass,
like if you harvested the seeds in May and
[SPEAKER_00]: then replanted them, could you get a fall
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that it's actually even
easier than that because if you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the area around the Maygrass weeded,
it will die in the middle of the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: and then spontaneously regenerate in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought that these plants had
completely senesced and were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few weeks ago, they started
sunning up new seed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're getting a second crop of
Maygrass out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice if you're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do anything except keep
it clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our Iva struggled a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really didn't do well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason why is because
we're way up on top of a hill on Caldwell
[SPEAKER_00]: Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a really dry June, and it just
didn't germinate well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this picture is kind of harder to
interpret, but this is the lowest plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's probably about a meter lower
than the other ones, not very extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the only one of these
abandoned plots where nothing germinated
[SPEAKER_00]: that had any Iva, this is Iva right here,
at all germinate in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that little difference in altitude and
soil moisture, I think, although I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: directly measuring that, is making a huge
difference in terms of whether or not this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can germinate and grow, which is
important for reconstructions of how this
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural system worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if people were trying to grow
these plants, plants together,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of them couldn't tolerate being
taken out of its sort of marshy
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, then that presents a
constraint for the agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, I guess I will take
questions for the next five minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, I just want to thank my,
especially thank my students, one of whom
[SPEAKER_00]: is here, Andrea and Peter, for just being
awesome this summer and keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments running when I've been out of
town and just being really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, Andrea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyone have questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a salinity factor here as well,
because both Cainapodes and Iva are upper
[SPEAKER_03]: salt marsh plants in this part of the
world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely a factor to be
explored, although many of the places that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found them growing are not
particularly salty out in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilds of the Midwest, but it's definitely
one of many factors that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting how well they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I really only had the time and
resources to grow them in one location,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to do two different
locations this summer, but it was just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't have enough manpower
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the soil could be a huge factor
that I really want to look into in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that the indigenous people
who fed on the Cainapodium and Iva were
[SPEAKER_03]: doing so because they were nutritionally
rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has any research been done on looking at
the nutrient content of the more ancient
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds versus their contemporary varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there has been very limited
research done on the nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one paper that looks at kind of
like gross nutritional properties like
[SPEAKER_00]: protein versus fat versus carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that has been
constrained by lack of seeds too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we want to do cooking experiments,
nutritional experiments with these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so far, like good farmers,
we had to first see to our needs for next
[SPEAKER_00]: year in terms of planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I didn't talk
about, but I'm hoping to get out of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we're also just growing a bunch of
plants in the greenhouse for seed so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be possible to do some kind of
nutritional analyses of the ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticates too, the ones that are from
the desiccated collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know enough about how that
works to know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a good collaborator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dana?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering in terms of why these
resources fell out of cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: became re-fertilized in the ancient,
if that was related to cultural,
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental, combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question is, so why do you... Okay,
so Dana's asking basically why these crops
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out of cultivation, if it was
environmental, cultural, or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a huge question that I would
love to do a long-term project on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the biggest problems I think
that we have with answering this question
[SPEAKER_00]: is that archeologists really like to date
the earliest occurrence of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not at all interested in
dating the latest occurrence of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually don't really know when
these plants fall out of cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: because people aren't trying to find the
latest assemblage and date it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I personally think, based on a sort
of cursory literature review, is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were at least some farmers that were
still growing these crops right up until
[SPEAKER_00]: European colonization began, and that that
knowledge was lost along with probably
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of other knowledge as communities
were moving around and so much warfare and
[SPEAKER_00]: destruction was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was going on, but it is
undeniable that there were definitely less
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing them by the time of
European colonization than had been before
[SPEAKER_00]: maize, beans, and squash arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that, to a certain extent,
once people had functioning mazeland races
[SPEAKER_00]: that worked for this climate, it was a
better crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that's part of the answer,
because people all over the world have
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted maize because it's highly
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's probably other things going on
too, and some communities like that one
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was like, ignore this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that's kind of like
an archaeological detail has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this assemblage here that's not
domesticated, that looks like it's even
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than the wild population,
it might not even be the right species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these people might have been just
cultivating the wrong species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say wrong because it was different from
what everybody else was ever cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are early adopters of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This culture is called Fort Ancient,
and it's an approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand-year-old culture in the Ohio
River Valley that's known for adopting
[SPEAKER_00]: maize as a staple crop really early before
other people had switched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really surprise me that
their knowledge of erect knotweed and
[SPEAKER_00]: their seed stock wasn't very good,
considering that they were so focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of variability too,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really an answer, but somebody
should write a dissertation about it
[SPEAKER_00]: someday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one more in the back, and then
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shattering is the thing that people
who study serial domestication in the old
[SPEAKER_00]: world, that's their favorite criteria
because it's less like wishy-washy than
[SPEAKER_00]: seed size, and they don't actually use a
seed, they use the chaff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll look at the morphology of the
rachis to see whether it was like a robust
[SPEAKER_00]: connection that had to be like broken or
whether it was like, I don't have an image
[SPEAKER_00]: of it right now, but it's based on
experimental studies where they've looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at the morphology in wild and domesticated
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be something similar for
these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's looked at it as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is a lot of them are into
hissin in their wild state, which is also
[SPEAKER_00]: a story for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Geneva, you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is buckwheat old world or new world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is buckwheat old world or new world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat is old world, and its
domestication is fairly not well
[SPEAKER_00]: understood compared to a lot of other old
world crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a pretty late domesticate,
and I think the latest is that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably domesticated on the Tibetan
Plateau somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Natalie, I again want to thank you for
a fascinating presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
