[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the sixth annual Cornell
Pioneer Symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very excited that you're all here,
both in Cornell, in Geneva, and all across
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever, if you're on the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Daniel Sweeney, and on behalf
of the Student Organizing Committee for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pioneer Symposium and Synapsis,
the graduate student plant breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: organization, we're very excited to have
you here for our seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, so this year, our theme is seed to
startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The startup business mentality is broadly
characterized by small size, risk taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: and innovative thinking, and may be
beneficial to plant breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This symposium features speakers
addressing how small plant breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: companies start and find success in a
marketplace dominated by larger breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, how large breeding companies
evaluate, acquire, and collaborate with
[SPEAKER_01]: startups, and how researchers start work
on largely unknown and novel crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to acknowledge the gracious
support of DuPont Pioneer for allowing us
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a symposium for the sixth year in
a row, and also the support of the section
[SPEAKER_01]: of plant breeding genetics here at Cornell
and Synapsis, the grad student
[SPEAKER_01]: organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to invite Taberet Abadi to give a
few opening remarks for us, and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: will commence with the speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure and an honor again to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six symposiums in a row, and great,
great, great thing to be back in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me some time to get here this
time, but I made it, and I'm very glad to
[SPEAKER_00]: be here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as usual, to start this,
we tried to give a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference of what this series is about,
and why we do it, and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: context of where we are going around the
world, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am out of fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the series is a series that is fully
student run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The students organize run absolutely all
the logistics, and manage the budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make all the decisions around the
symposia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of the universities work on their
own, in a way, and as much as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating with the other universities
around the world, but driving their own
[SPEAKER_00]: agenda to actually do what is meaningful
for them, both from the scientific or from
[SPEAKER_00]: educational perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their own situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we think that this is a way to
meaningfully contribute to education,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of the skills that the
students learn or acquire during the
[SPEAKER_00]: process are hands on skills related to
budget management, risk management,
[SPEAKER_00]: making adequate networking with the
scientific community, communication in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all very, very important skills
that are going to be useful for their
[SPEAKER_00]: future careers, no matter where they end
on their career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is a major emphasis
for us, because the way that we see this
[SPEAKER_00]: is we are contributing to build a broader
scientific community for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is we think that this is an
opportunity for outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for Pioneer to actually share
what we are doing, but for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: community to actually open it up to the
public, and listen to new ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and discuss in a scientific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relevant topics for the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, of course, is while
doing this, we think that the students
[SPEAKER_00]: have the opportunity to think about their
future career, career opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably the topic of my
conversation yesterday with most of you
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had had the chance to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we try to be very open
minded on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, very clearly making it clear that
it is not just about one career
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, but it's broader.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to promote that idea generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about the history of the
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started in Minnesota in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept doing this symposium in
Minnesota continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year is going to be the 10th
event consecutive in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The students, as Mark always says,
once you ask the grad students to organize
[SPEAKER_00]: something, they do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took it to Madison as a proof of
concept to see what's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year after, we began expanding
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we are this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flyer that you can see all the new
universities that are added this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I realize now that it's not
absolutely complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have at least one more university in
the series now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is, again, to build a global
forum and as much as possible to take this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to everybody that is
interested in participating and playing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way within the general rules of this
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are excited that we have reached
this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel was asking me yesterday,
when is this going to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I yet don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the idea has become known by other
people, they really want to participate
[SPEAKER_00]: and have the opportunity to do this on
their own communities too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, while I have energy,
I will try to give the opportunity to as
[SPEAKER_00]: many people that are interested as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this series this year,
we would have had more than 90 events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now it's really around 42
universities and more than 15,000
[SPEAKER_00]: participants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, there was an event in India in
which the total number of participants was
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I was not really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody that was there was very
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a great event for them and a
great opportunity for them to bring people
[SPEAKER_00]: from all around the subcontinent too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that we want to do with
this is to build up a forum for
[SPEAKER_00]: participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that we try to do every
year, and at least once or twice a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to have either an in-person meeting or
a virtual meeting with as many
[SPEAKER_00]: participants and organizers as possible to
make general decisions about the series
[SPEAKER_00]: and which other things that we need to
keep doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to establish the general governance of
the series so that it doesn't rely on a
[SPEAKER_00]: single person in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we share the decisions among
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there were a lot of ideas
that we had, that we tested, that we
[SPEAKER_00]: discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a great opportunity for people to
think broadly too about the whole series,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just about their own experience that
they manage very well, but actually to
[SPEAKER_00]: think and to learn from other people
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another component I think that is very
important is the idea of expanding topics
[SPEAKER_00]: and expanding, opening up to new ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that Cornell has been a
testament for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you always bring new things into
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very proud of that, of the work
that you guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other places are actually doing the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started originally to be sincere around
plant breeding and a little bit of bias on
[SPEAKER_00]: our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been expanding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have symposia that are mainly
based on a much more diverse set of
[SPEAKER_00]: topics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from pure plant pathology and
entomology to genomic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are even considering working with
some projects that are working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: interface between engineering and the
plant sciences so that we could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: begin working with a broader community
into that space too and bring the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I mean, expand our
connections for the future of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big things are going to happen in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that, you know, we really are
able to expand this even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, you know, I always put
this as this is an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the universities have been
publishing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And publishing in the academic community
is a very powerful tool, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: to communicate and to systematize and to
make things clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: On what are your objectives?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these are things that are
all peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, you know, it becomes part of
the larger community by participating in
[SPEAKER_00]: the language and ways of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is, you know,
each of the symposia has their own
[SPEAKER_00]: webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a centralized webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a repository of all the
webpages of the individual symposia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can actually go to that
centralized webpage and navigate back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual webpages to get the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, the webcasts and,
you know, the information about the
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker, the organizers, and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually thinking about doing some
research on all this data that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered over the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that we have enough
replication now, 90 events, to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: try to do some data mining and actually
try to understand what has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, again, thanks to Synapsys
and to the community here in Cornell for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this and for keeping doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we have a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we will enjoy a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
