[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really delightful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very thankful to Alex and to Kathy for
helping to bring me to Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very much to Lou, as well,
who's somewhere in the back, for helping
[SPEAKER_00]: on all the logistical arrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun and also frightening to talk
about these topics in front of a room full
[SPEAKER_00]: of scientists, which is not my typical
audience, because you all will know when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying things that are totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The historians don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope you'll be kind in the Q&A if
I've totally butchered something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I have an interesting story
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to apologize to anyone who's
listening to this on Zoom, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: PowerPoint looks pretty nice in person,
but will look clunky on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have my apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let me begin with the problem of
rotten shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the year is 1942.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is late August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Australian and American armed
forces are fighting to defend a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategically valuable point at the
southeastern tip of Papua New Guinea,
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Milne Bay, which is roughly
there, from a Japanese assault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the Battle of Milne Bay was a
small engagement, it was important for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, for instance, the first time in
World War II that a Japanese amphibious
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion was defeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also fought in a hot,
humid, jungle environment, an almost
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous pouring rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photo gives you a sense of the
landscape and its challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a field recording from
elsewhere in Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're hearing is the experience
of being in a rain in the Gondola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Australian forces who had been in the
region longer noticed that much of their
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment was malfunctioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine detectors did not detect tank mines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio sets went dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soldiers found that they couldn't even see
through their guns sites because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged by mysterious forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boots and tents fell apart overnight in
the hot and wet environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guidebook published in 1943 by the
Allied forces explained, quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: And as evidence of what that meant,
this is an ammunition magazine after one
[SPEAKER_00]: week of exposure in New Guinea compared
with a factory fresh magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this was not the first time that
militaries had fought in a humid
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the scale and the intensity
of the conflict in the tropics caused a
[SPEAKER_00]: previously invisible environment to make
itself felt very forcibly on world
[SPEAKER_00]: militaries, technologically,
scientifically, and strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molds, in particular, microscopic life
forms that most soldiers had never even
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about were coming out of the
woods, very literally, to sabotage the war
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today what I'm going to do is trace the
development of the science of
[SPEAKER_00]: deterioration prevention, which we can
think about as the effort to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how environments damage materials and how
it made our system of sort of global fast
[SPEAKER_00]: moving goods possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already told you about the problem of
moldy shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue by giving you
background on my larger book project and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of giving some context for this
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll trace how the field was transformed
or I'll introduce you to the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial mycology and talk about how
that was transformed by the fighting in
[SPEAKER_00]: World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I'll end by showing how these
technical and scientific advances from
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier decades enabled the growth of
rotten capitalism, you'll forgive the pun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but an economic system that is structured
on an ambivalent relationship with fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: both proactively utilizing micro fungi to
produce products, but also destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi to preserve a series of other
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last few years, I've been
working on a history of the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal science, as Alex very kindly
explained, and I've been exploring a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of connected disciplines,
so taxonomic mycology, medical mycology,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathology, industrial mycology,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the project, I'm particularly
interested in thinking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: previously ignored aspects of the
environment become knowable by scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: and by regular people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that knowledge propels novel forms
of utilization of those materials and
[SPEAKER_00]: produces new human relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we know that a mushroom is a
fungus rather than a plant, which most
[SPEAKER_00]: people throughout history did not think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that change our relationship
to that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean for how we interact with
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling the book Rotten Beauty to kind
of index this ambivalent relationship that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have with fungal things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are lovely, beautiful,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are scary, dangerous,
and need to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research builds on my first book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is The Shameless Self-Promotion
Moment, which comes out in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I provide a history of the
laboratory dog over the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be wondering, why is someone who
wrote a book about dogs qualified or
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in writing a book about
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one answer to that question is my sort
of repeated interest in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mention this in part because an early
section of that first book talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: influential research on canine health and
diseases that took place not very far from
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are now at the Baker Institute,
which was then known as the research
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory for the diseases of dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This facility opened in the 1950s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that Ithaca looked a
little bit different back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the many ways that my
historical interests have kind of returned
[SPEAKER_00]: me to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a historian, I'm kind of interested
in the knowledge that we have about other
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efforts to make sense of dogs or pigs or
parrots or other kinds of living things
[SPEAKER_00]: connect unexpected people across places,
across disciplines, across knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the dog book, I was really
interested in what is it like for
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and other people to study an
animal that they identify with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they see themselves in dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like being with dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is a little bit different
with a fungus that many scientists who
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with them don't really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like them very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of disgusting at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not something that you want to
have in your house too much of,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this changed the kinds of
historical questions that I was interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in trying to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we come to deal with and understand
alien or invisible or microscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as this sketch that I found in a
Dutch museum helpfully demonstrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I began to shift my focus from the dog at
the top of the tree to the mushrooms at
[SPEAKER_00]: its bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with good reason because
today, if you open newspapers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to avoid the sense that the
world needs fungi to save us from a host
[SPEAKER_00]: of modern problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, I think, an eagerness in the
cultural sphere for the non-human power of
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms and other fungal things to save
us from human-made crises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my project, I'm trying to bring
together a number of historical threads to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain how we got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it make sense that fungi could be
a solution to global climate problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: other issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, however, the first person to try
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm following somewhat in the
footsteps of Geoffrey Ainsworth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the British mycologist and historian,
who attempted in three books published in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1970s and 80s to try to do something
of a broad, sweeping history of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycological science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the benefit and the fault of
Ainsworth's work is that he separated
[SPEAKER_00]: these topics into sort of their distinct
disciplinary areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in doing so, I think he accepted the
idea that these are different
[SPEAKER_00]: undertakings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested in trying to bring some
of these things more together and tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: more comprehensive story about the
development of this knowledge project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you just a few overarching
kind of threads, and then I'll get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the question of rotten stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of what I'm interested in is
tracing the development of general
[SPEAKER_00]: mycology as it emerged out of botany and
separated itself from conventional medical
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in the late 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at tools of visualization from
water color and microscopes to DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing and image recognition
algorithms to show how a vision of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycology or fungal biology as a sort of
worldwide project began to take over in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say a bit more about this a little
bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also interested in tracing how medical
mycology gradually separated itself from
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways of knowing and engaging with
fungal things and how the people who study
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal infections became sort of caught at
times between different worlds,
[SPEAKER_00]: between medical schools and biological
laboratories, and often suffered the
[SPEAKER_00]: funding challenges of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The historic marginalization of medical
mycology I think is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: because today we know that fungal diseases
are of growing prominence and importance
[SPEAKER_00]: at an international scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the World Health Organization has said
that the next pandemics could be fungal in
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change, of course, is increasing
this risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to understand
this history and understand why we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: done so much research in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area of the book that's,
of course, very relevant here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a major transformation at the
start of the 20th century where suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: universities all around the world are
opening programs in plant pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: including this one here at Cornell,
and begin to see the subject as essential
[SPEAKER_00]: for the development of international
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did that influence our sort of
modern version of agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of you who know a lot about
rusts will maybe recognize this as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Elvin Stackman's early research into wheat
rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few of the threads of the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk more in the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to bore everyone with too
much sort of overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm trying to argue is that
although often kind of ignored and thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of as a subsidiary or unimportant area,
research about fungal things really
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed and shaped the 20th century in
very prominent ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm preaching to the choir
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think more people need to think
about the history of mycological science
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand its importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to illustrate a bit of this ambivalent
relationship that people have to fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about the
field of industrial mycology, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from, and sort of show how this
developed into a much kind of broader and
[SPEAKER_00]: more nebulous sort of study of
environmental deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1938, British mycologist George Smith
published the first edition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduction to Industrial Mycology and
acquainted many people with a new area of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge concerning fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Smith explained in his preface to the
first edition, quote, this book is
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to assist those who are
commencing the study of molds rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: a fungi in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is already an extensive literature
of systematic mycology, plant pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been up to the present no
book in English dealing particularly with
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungi, which are of importance in
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Smith made clear, there was a great
amount of mycological knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: existence, but biochemical knowledge of
molds was urgently needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what had changed to make that
necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochemist Harold Raistrick, who is today
so little remembered that I actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: to create his Wikipedia page, explained
that the two basic challenges of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial mycology in a forward to
Smith's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, on the one hand, you have all
these industries involved in handling
[SPEAKER_00]: organic materials, including the food
industry, the textile industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: wood, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these industries were losing
extensive supplies and products to the
[SPEAKER_00]: destructive powers of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antifungal sprays and other kinds of
things were needed to combat these molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the other hand, biochemists
had recognized the marvelous powers and
[SPEAKER_00]: capacities of fungi for producing useful
industrial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you may know that prior to
World War I, most of the world's citric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid came from lemons in Sicily,
which are shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were used in the production of
things like sodas, desserts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But World War I cut America off from
citric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to find artificial and
synthetic ways to produce citric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: without getting all of these Italian
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an important development for a
whole bunch of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really bad for Sicily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it introduced a lot of researchers
like Raistrick to this idea that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: use small fungal organisms and produce
these kind of fantastic and useful
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raistrick knew about all of this firsthand
because during the First World War,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had participated in secretive research
to use yeast to produce glycerol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a key chemical for explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: His findings were utilized in the war
effort, but they were also really valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: for the British mining industry in
peacetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of synthetic explosives were
produced for mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: In subsequent years, Raistrick focused his
attention on assaying fungi for a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of other useful industrial purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 1920s, he took up a chair in
biochemistry in the London School of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
where he appointed Smith, the author of
[SPEAKER_00]: the book, as his research assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than explosives, though,
Smith came to industrial mycology via the
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He began his career as a chemist for the
textile manufacturer Boardman and Baron,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the headquarters are very blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boardman and a number of other companies
at this time were producing dotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a sort of white cotton fabric
that was shipped to British India to use
[SPEAKER_00]: for clothing and a bunch of other uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the long oceanic transit,
however, from England to India,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these things mildewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became sort of destroyed by fungal
processes that was then known as
[SPEAKER_00]: tendering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a brand new concern at this
time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, this print from the 18th
century Japanese artist Katsukawa Shunsho
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to depict women airing out books
to prevent mildew and insect infestations,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to curators, which kind of
demonstrates that this fight against
[SPEAKER_00]: spoilage was a very longstanding one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Smith's work showed how the British
Empire in this kind of continent spanning
[SPEAKER_00]: scope made a lot of these economic
problems much more serious and requiring
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the exact numbers are difficult
to come by, it's clear that a huge number
[SPEAKER_00]: of cotton goods were destroyed by mildews
during this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response, the British Cotton
Manufacturers Research Arm in Manchester,
[SPEAKER_00]: known as the Shirley Institute,
shown here, invested significant effort
[SPEAKER_00]: into understanding how to prevent and
destroy these molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, the most effective solution
was the application of zinc chloride,
[SPEAKER_00]: which protected clothes, but you needed to
use a ton of it, so it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around 1930, researchers at the
Shirley Institute had a breakthrough with
[SPEAKER_00]: a new anti-fungal product known as
salicylanolide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was a mouthful, they called
it Shirland for their institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: For over a decade, Shirland was the single
best way to prevent cotton products from
[SPEAKER_00]: deteriorating over time in warm,
moist environments and to prevent their
[SPEAKER_00]: tendering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so building on their work in the
1930s, Smith was able to identify a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of species of aspergillus responsible for
this mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here what you're seeing is the
aspergillus organism inside the fabric of
[SPEAKER_00]: the doti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may know that they're called
this because Pierre Antonio McKelley
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that under a microscope,
the aspergillia looked a lot like the sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of holy water dispenser that he found in
the Catholic Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, at roughly the same time,
a lot of American mycologists were also
[SPEAKER_00]: studying aspergillum, and they were
reclassifying the aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charles Tom and Margaret Church
published a big monograph reclassifying
[SPEAKER_00]: the family around this time, or the genus
around this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Smith's work took that kind of
laboratory mycological research and
[SPEAKER_00]: combined it with a much more economic
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed how laboratory mycology
could really have a sort of major economic
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research was pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ray Strick brought him to the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on industrial mycology full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Smith's book introduced industrial
mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go on to have six editions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty popular text.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it remains the case that this sort of
general area of research only became truly
[SPEAKER_00]: popular because of World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Smith explained toward the end of the
conflict, quote, before the war,
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the loss in tropical countries
caused by molds was taken for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moreover, there was no coordinating
body, like the Ministry of Supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: to initiate research, which would benefit
many different industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There simply had not been enough modern
military equipment in a tropical place
[SPEAKER_00]: like New Guinea to justify research at the
necessary scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: A similar thing is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably know for penicillin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antibiotic activity of penicillin,
which is produced from penicillium molds,
[SPEAKER_00]: was known for decades before World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was only produced at industrial
scales because the war added sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of dollars into finding ways to
produce penicillin much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So World War II is often thought of
generally as the physicist's war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people think of this fellow here,
Oppenheimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we can also think about
World War II as the mycologist's war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without mycologists, the war would
have gone dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In retrospect, it's a little surprising
that it took this kind of large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: international conflict to get people
interested in the question of tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, the bananas that arrived from
Central America to places like New
[SPEAKER_00]: Orleans, which is shown here in the 1920s,
were gathered in tropical climates by
[SPEAKER_00]: workers whose health was a major economic
and social concern at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public health researcher Alfred Reed,
for instance, explained in an overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of tropical medicine that
attention to tropical medicine was one key
[SPEAKER_00]: indication that everywhere commerce,
business, and government are recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that more and more of mankind must live in
close relationship with the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this idea that a lot of
Western folks were moving to the tropics
[SPEAKER_00]: and that it needed to be made safe for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example from the time, this is a 1914
newspaper headline of a speech by Army
[SPEAKER_00]: Surgeon General William Gorgas,
who said that science had so advanced in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last decade, it is now safe for any
white man to make his home in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a time, but as you can tell,
the focus here was really on making white
[SPEAKER_00]: people safe from tropical diseases,
not so much on the technological
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructures that existed in tropical
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was instead the mass quantities of
material moving during World War II that
[SPEAKER_00]: made this consideration somewhat
unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to one early estimate,
nearly 50% of all items shipped by the
[SPEAKER_00]: British military to Burma were lost in
transit or destroyed by molds in transit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an astonishing amount of stuff if
you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As researchers learned, the majority of
then identified molds live really well
[SPEAKER_00]: between 75 and 85 degrees at high levels
of humidity, which was the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that were found throughout this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was mold heaven, and it wreaked
havoc on a lot of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 1940s, scientific
collaboration began between Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: England, and the United States,
which sort of pooled findings together to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how could we protect all of our
stuff from destruction by mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the American side, the research
organization was partly led by this man,
[SPEAKER_00]: Selman Waksman, who is better known for
coining the term antibiotic and leading
[SPEAKER_00]: the discovery of streptomycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Waksman was important in leading the
kind of American side of the tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: deterioration fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of the Allied work,
the Australians found, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: that US-packed things were a lot better
than British-packed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not totally sure why, but Americans
were, I guess, just better at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually one of the major
revelations that pushed Australia away
[SPEAKER_00]: from a traditional relationship with
England and toward a relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of Australian-American
technological relationship really got
[SPEAKER_00]: going at this moment in World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the urgency of this concern,
research initially took place in
[SPEAKER_00]: metropolitan laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in London, Smith and Raistrick at the
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: became kind of the semi-formal experts on
how to protect things from tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They constructed tropical chambers where
temperature and humidity could be kept at
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially elevated levels to facilitate
mold growth and to try to kind of test
[SPEAKER_00]: product deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As simulations of a faraway environment,
I think that they didn't really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These experiments are really important as
an attempt to kind of domesticate faraway
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical places and recreate them inside
of temperate climates, so the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can grow all kinds of wonderful
trees here despite the snow in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question was, or the problem was,
this didn't work that well for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tropical chambers just didn't
produce the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the war pressed onwards,
it was also deemed important to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical testing stations throughout the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1940s, Britain founded the
West African Tropical Testing
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishment in colonial Nigeria in Port
Harcourt, which you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I lost my little arrow down kind of
the bottom on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the station, both electrical and
textile goods were tested aggressively in
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of similar tropical conditions to see
how they would hold up over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kinds of products could protect them
from deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: An exhibit in Australia in July 1945
confirmed just how central packing seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be for the war effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't typically think of waterproof
cardboard as an exciting development of
[SPEAKER_00]: World War II, but here it is literally
central in this museum exhibit to what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the technological developments of the
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropic proofed items emerged as a really
visible signal that could be shared with
[SPEAKER_00]: the public of the kind of innovations of
the allied military's flexible approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: warfare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were similar exhibits also in the
UK, which kind of showcased these findings
[SPEAKER_00]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tropic packaging became this really
essential example of sort of how adaptable
[SPEAKER_00]: the American and British militaries were.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the war, electronics were
being hermetically sealed to resist
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binoculars were shipped with silica gel
inside to resist in molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packaging materials were now waterproof
and resistant to humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an entire tropical sort of protection
regime had come into operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these developments were very much a
shared project, but if British researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: like Smith and Raistrick had kind of the
initial advantage, by the end of the war,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really American mycologists who
were the leaders in the development of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the Tropical Deterioration
Information Center, which was located at
[SPEAKER_00]: George Washington University, became kind
of the centerpiece of collating all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that existed about mold
management and prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many British researchers found this to be
a rather upsetting development because
[SPEAKER_00]: they had been the traditional experts in
mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it was in the United States that sort
of fungal knowledge was best kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a scientific shifting of the
guard that had really important
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for the history of biology in
the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropic proofing may not have really won
the war for the allies, but I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: aided in their fight, and it caused some
major changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, and I think most important for
those who work here, is that it spurred a
[SPEAKER_00]: really large transformation in the field
of what we maybe now think of as fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in his presidential address to the
Mycological Society of America in 1949,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred Sparrow, who you see here,
explained, quote, that the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycology has been given a new impetus and
drive in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent years, for many years,
research in mycology has been primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological and taxonomic, and it has
been fruitful work indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But new research, Sparrow continued,
was making possible the recent development
[SPEAKER_00]: and expansion almost by leaps and bounds
of new fields of investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in one of the examples of these sort
of new fields that were really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: he talked about new research on
Neurospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sparrow perceived the emergence of what he
called a new mycology, and he argued that
[SPEAKER_00]: the MS A needed to adapt itself to this
new biological laboratory style of
[SPEAKER_00]: inquiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycologists were no longer principally
taxonomic botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were practically inclined.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked with the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked with agricultural groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increasingly, much of their research
was focused in high-tech laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used things like electron
microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a major cause of this change,
Sparrow mentioned in his presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the war, that it had given tons of
money to a lot of these researchers and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed them to develop brand new
biological research regimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around this same time in the
mid-1950s that Jeffrey Ainsworth started
[SPEAKER_00]: to publish a series of articles on a
problem that was facing researchers of his
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was too much mycological information
for them to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just too much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lecture he gave to graduate students
at the University of Wisconsin in 1962,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ainsworth explained quote, mycological
information is increasing exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the literature of mycology is today
published in more languages and scattered
[SPEAKER_00]: through more publications than ever
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycologists, in common with other
scientists, have the problems of noting,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorting, storing, and retrieving
information, problems that are complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the fact that in addition to the
literature, much mycological information
[SPEAKER_00]: is kept as dead specimens preserved in
herbaria and as living specimens conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: in culture collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you are probably familiar with
this idea that there's too much science to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up with, but the point is that this
was already acutely felt in 1950.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, in fact, it was felt even earlier
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third group in this figure that I
think looks like a kind of avant-garde
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metal band is Italian mycologist
Pier Andrea Sicardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late 1800s, Sicardo began
collecting all known species of fungi with
[SPEAKER_00]: the help of a bunch of assistants into a
single multi-volume book, which he called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Seloge Fungorum Omnium Hucusque
Cognitorum, the collection of all
[SPEAKER_00]: presently known fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote it in Latin because he considered
Latin a universal language that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: could speak, and so it solved the problem
of translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Italians, you have Americans,
you have Japanese folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all doing mycology, but they can't
speak to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they use Latin, that'll solve all
of those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent letters and postcards,
like this one below, to researchers all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world to exchange samples,
turning the botanical plant garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: Padua into a kind of center place for the
collection of specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this sort of mail exchange,
was uniquely possible at this moment in
[SPEAKER_00]: time because the Universal Postal Union
had just gotten started during this
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, if you sent a postcard,
you had to worry about the local cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging your money, whether you'd be
charged extra at transit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Universal Postal Union meant that
Sicardo could send a letter from Padua.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get to America, and everyone is
paying roughly the same price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exchange of Exacata, things like
that, was uniquely possible in this
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sicardo got started in the early 1880s,
and he thought that he could list every
[SPEAKER_00]: species of fungus within eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it turned out that it was a
really difficult project, and he was still
[SPEAKER_00]: working on it, and the 25th volume came
out in 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for almost 50 years, most of his life,
Sicardo was trying to list all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more recently, we know that the
arrival of internet-enabled mycology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1990s did not cause the information
problem to disappear, but rather to
[SPEAKER_00]: mutate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a 1998 paper, Kathy Hodge and Tom
Volk predicted that the World Wide Web
[SPEAKER_00]: would enable researchers across the planet
to search large databases of species and
[SPEAKER_00]: access specimen identification keys that
were formerly only available to those with
[SPEAKER_00]: privileges at specialty libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of a democratizing vision
of mycological research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say that they were right about
this, that you can do all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But scholars at the time also worried that
this internet-enabled mycology was
[SPEAKER_00]: creating new problems for the working
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, if a species was first
published online and the website went
[SPEAKER_00]: away, how could you ensure that that
information would be saved?
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you believe that something was a
species if it wasn't published in a book?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think today we're now very aware that
when databases disappear, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge can go with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more close to the present,
with the flood of new possible species
[SPEAKER_00]: identified with advanced sequencing
techniques, yet without obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological characteristics,
there are new questions about what it
[SPEAKER_00]: means to name or identify an organism in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hoping to suggest here is that
I think history can help orient us to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these ongoing conversations about
arranging and controlling mycological
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent generations have felt flooded
by overwhelming quantities of information
[SPEAKER_00]: for over 100 years, each time made
possible by new technological developments
[SPEAKER_00]: of their ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these generations developed new
tools and new ways of coping with this
[SPEAKER_00]: changing world of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really the war that kind of got
a lot of this started and sort of made the
[SPEAKER_00]: massive expansion of mycology possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of scientific
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another major sort of result of a lot
of this wartime research into tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: deterioration was in how this affected the
world of industrial products and their
[SPEAKER_00]: movement around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US Tropical Deterioration Information
Center, which was that bibliography group
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned, rebranded in 1945 as the
Prevention of Deterioration Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its bibliographers carefully collected all
kinds of information about deterioration
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the name change, I think, signaled
that they were expanding from a focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical questions to deterioration at the
kind of broadest possible level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1954, they published a general guide,
The Deterioration of Materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is covered, celebrated as,
quote, the first book ever published to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover all aspects of deterioration
prevention, which is a very exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: claim, you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the center, which continued operations
until 1964, continued to receive extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: support from all the branches of the
American military.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason is that the
American military did not give up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of tropical deterioration after
World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, the US kept access to tropical
testing facilities in places like Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Britain maintained access to them
until they were kicked out of Nigeria when
[SPEAKER_00]: it became an independent country in 1958.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they closed in 1958.
[SPEAKER_00]: Independence came later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US military has fought to maintain
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason is that studies in
the middle of the 20th century predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: that all future conflicts were likely to
take place in tropical environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the American military had to
continuously test all of its goods in
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical places.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of came to a head in 1977,
when the Carter-Torrijos Treaty required
[SPEAKER_00]: the US to leave Panama, potentially lose
access to this tropical testing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't quite happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the US actually maintains a lot of
tropical testing all across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hoping to kind of suggest also
is that this early sort of mycological
[SPEAKER_00]: research focus into tropical deterioration
was not just important for scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also underwrote an expansion of the
American military all across the planet in
[SPEAKER_00]: a vision of sort of American military
power that could be projected anywhere at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time, because American guns could be
safe and protected, whether they're here,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're in Guam, or whether
they're somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't just change science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really changed how the American
military imagined its readiness on a
[SPEAKER_00]: global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also really affected visions of
post-war international trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the war, you have a lot of
companies who emerge and start to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the exciting new ability for
American corporations to expand their
[SPEAKER_00]: business across the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1944, John Glenn of the Pan-American
Trust Company noted that American business
[SPEAKER_00]: could take advantage of post-war world
trade, expanding into new markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote,
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, he stressed that this
opportunity would rely on willingness to
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of all of these wartime
developments in packaging and shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new techniques developed during the
war were perceived as sort of essential
[SPEAKER_00]: elements of the expansion of American
corporate sort of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Scientific American explained in 1945,
commercial shippers may not be working in
[SPEAKER_00]: quite the same areas, but they could use
these new tropical shipping and prevention
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries in order to sell their goods
in all kinds of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could build a motorcycle in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get it to the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be in fine working condition
when it arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it enabled this vision of a truly
global kind of capitalist enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a vast array of research
programs into various sort of modes of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus prevention and tropic programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study, for instance, emphasized that
trade with tropical areas was increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason for doing a lot of this
research was this expansion in tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless examples of this
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't list all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much of it concerns this idea of
adapting wartime discoveries to the new
[SPEAKER_00]: peaceful post-war environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at the height of optimism about
peaceful uses of radioactivity,
there are many examples of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of radioactivity, there were
suggestions by some people that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: zap underground cables with high levels of
radiation to keep fungi from destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of ways to fungus-proof the New
World Order.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more important development
that I think came from a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it concerns a new material that was
popularized during this period because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its fungal resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PVC, or polyvinyl chloride,
was discovered in 1872 by chemist Eugen
[SPEAKER_00]: Baumann.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it only received widespread
application in the 1930s and 1940s after
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist Waldo Siemen at the Goodrich
Company boiled some waste PVC and turned
[SPEAKER_00]: it into this flexible plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually immune to fungal deterioration,
PVC was used widely after the war for
[SPEAKER_00]: things like vinyl records, pipes,
and even some mini-golf hazards.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1966, the Goodrich Company produced 260
million pounds of PVC a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, the most recent estimate I
could find is that nearly 6 billion pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of PVC is produced annually in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So massive amounts of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem, as you can probably
predict or already know, is that PVC is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely damaging to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both its production and its lifecycle
release harmful chemicals that build up in
[SPEAKER_00]: water, air, food chains, et cetera,
and cause a variety of human health
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think from the present vantage point,
we can tell a very different story about
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not just a development about
miraculously overcoming the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and building all these wonderful
fungus-proof things, but of creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: host of new materials and processes that
didn't just resist the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually potentially destroyed the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a multifaceted transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, with all the stories about how
fungi might save lives, we're experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: a kind of ironic inversion of a lot of
this history.
[SPEAKER_00]: As unrecyclable plastics give way to
sustainable alternatives, now you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that we can actually build all of our
shipping boxes out of fungi themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to protect boxes from
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build boxes out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial mycology is thus kind of
reemerging to neutralize a problem partly
[SPEAKER_00]: of its own making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial mycology was thus an essential
component in the system of production and
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange that expanded around the world
after World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: The universe of fast-moving commodities
and waterproof boxes with those little
[SPEAKER_00]: desiccating silica gel packets that you
never totally know what to do with,
[SPEAKER_00]: shielded by plastic wrap, all of this got
started after World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was made possible by major advances
in mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system, as we know, is also a rather
destructive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by studying how this knowledge changed
and transformed, how it was lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it developed, I'm hoping we can better
approach the present and the ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that we deal with today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'll end by returning to a more basic
question for you all, which is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: means to study a fungus and why anyone
would want to do that in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011, the late Cornell mycologist
Dick Korff addressed the Congress of Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: American Mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, Korff worried that granting
agencies were now aggressively dictating
[SPEAKER_00]: what kinds of research people could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional ivory tower, he worried,
was disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was being destroyed by commercial
forces, which I think we're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Korff insisted that I do not find this
to be a doomsday picture, but rather a
[SPEAKER_00]: candid view of our future in which we can
hope by changing our focus to pursue the
[SPEAKER_00]: holy grail of saving whatever we can of
our natural diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this as a moral duty, and I'm
convinced that we have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: change our focus to one of serving
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a complicated moment like the one we
find ourselves in today, perhaps we can
[SPEAKER_00]: take some solace in knowing that others
have faced down a lot of the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: about funding, political involvement with
research, and we can embrace the work of
[SPEAKER_00]: saving what we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't mention it, but I'm curious if
part of the research for your book
[SPEAKER_03]: includes culinary mycology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say more about what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just either I'm thinking of culinary
production for edible mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also, I guess, foraging is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I almost talked about this today,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I missed an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting part about it,
there's a major transformation in how
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms are grown and produced for
agriculture starting in the late 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing into the early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1800s, you have these
interesting French guys who start going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the catacombs of Paris and growing
mushrooms underground, which they realize
[SPEAKER_00]: is the perfect place to do it because it's
kind of artificially temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled, protected from rain,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea of using caves to grow
mushrooms becomes super, super popular at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Americans try to do it,
for instance, in Mammoth Cave,
[SPEAKER_00]: the national park.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of fails because it turns out
there isn't a big market in Kentucky for
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get a lot of these projects to
kind of turn caves and abandoned tunnels,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, into mushroom production
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Americans make really major
advances in pure culturing and then
[SPEAKER_00]: growing mushrooms in controlled outside
greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you get to the fact that
Kennett Square, for instance, is now one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world mushroom production meccas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this has to do with research
in a little bit of an earlier time period,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that takes some of these pure culture
techniques and then supplies them to
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's part of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am interested in kind of tracing
this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a kind of connected question
of production of soy sauce and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these culinary products that require kind
of industrial mycological work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this will hopefully be in the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that it's kind of surprising
that it took so long for industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: mycology to emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an area of study, given how long for
that trade in the tropics had been going
[SPEAKER_01]: on with perishable things, I wonder if you
could say a bit more about why you think
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't emerge in previous centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that part of the easy
answer, I suppose, is that there was not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough stuff yet in tropical places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't deteriorating at a fast
enough rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, as I kind of said here,
World War II is a really wonderful moment
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bad moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a kind of industrial and
scientific standpoint, it's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting moment because you have so
much money being invested with very little
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of concern about wasted funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if there's an urgent problem,
it's worth working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get massive investments in the
problem of tropical deterioration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are just unthinkable in any earlier
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody had enough money for that
to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if our soldiers are literally getting
lost in the jungle because their radio
[SPEAKER_00]: sets are being eaten away by molds and
they can't even talk to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't see through their guns,
I mean, that's a life and death problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the US military invests a massive
amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the same is sort of true
with the Manhattan Project, that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these massive fundamental advances in
physics that are possible because an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of money is invested into
these questions right during that time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had an audience of politicians
here, I would argue that this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: massive expenditure has all kinds of sort
of fundamental and basic benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that that kind of broad project
dream of sort of spending tens or hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of millions of dollars at a time to solve
these problems kind of dries up
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just doesn't exist in kind of the
earlier period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a question about permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're talking about the exchange of
material and collecting all the different
[SPEAKER_05]: funds, I imagine that maybe it's gotten
worse, like permitting and exchange more
[SPEAKER_05]: restricted over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that true?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does that play out where there's
relaxes and regulation and then stricter
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an influence to the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for like collecting samples and
sort of shipping them around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like there's negative impacts by you
could have outbreaks in other areas,
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, disappointingly, early in the 20th
century, there are very few restrictions
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you can take from a place and
ship elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the sort of charm or humor of
looking at like Cicardo's correspondence
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the biggest problem is just that
if someone ships something from North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, so like J.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ellis would send him stuff and it would
just get lost all the time on boats and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would get stuck at the post office for
months because the post office didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real concern was that it was a
weapon or something was being kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: illegally moved across international.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's very little concern about that
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, there's also not that much
interest at the time in studying the sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the funga of non-Western places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really intense focus is on European
North American, to some extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Japanese species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of attention to Central
American, South American, African
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there are very few
restrictions, the kind of ideological
[SPEAKER_00]: focus meant that a huge amount of sort of
possible questions weren't really asked at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time in terms of species that could
have been studied, but just there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: enough attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely changes, of course,
as you get into the later 20th century
[SPEAKER_00]: when things become a lot harder to just
kind of pick up and ship around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there weren't a lot of
restrictions early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Curtis Gates Lloyd is a wonderful sort
of mycological history figure that some
[SPEAKER_00]: may know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in Cincinnati, and he creates
this journal called Mycological Notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that if you ship him a
mushroom from anywhere in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will identify it, and he'll send you a
free copy of Mycological Notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a bunch of money that he's made
through pharmaceutical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's able to do this in a way that most
other people can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amazing thing about Lloyd is that
he is getting things shipped to him from
[SPEAKER_00]: just everywhere across the planet at a
kind of breathtaking scale and develops
[SPEAKER_00]: this unbelievable dried specimens
collection, in part because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost no restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got all these guys who are just
bored colonial administrators in Angola or
[SPEAKER_00]: Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I didn't have much going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this kind of spectacular
international trade at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also slow to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that's lost in transit
because dried specimens don't hold up very
[SPEAKER_00]: well when they're received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different kinds of problems
at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions from our audience
today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you'll join me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is a little random.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early on, you showed the magazine being
completely destroyed by mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine that that would be made out
of metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But molds can't eat metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm wondering how did it get that
destroyed that quickly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just like acid production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of problems that
they deal with during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I suppose I should have
talked about a little bit more is that at
[SPEAKER_00]: first, the major concern is only about
mold action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's initially a kind of purely
mycological concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how do we stop the molds from
getting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they do cloud gun sights from the
inside, which people can't figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does become clear that after a
while, molds aren't the only problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the other problem is just massive
constant humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have things that are just in
very wet environments where metal is
[SPEAKER_00]: corroding very, very quickly over extended
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of the combined effect of
moisture corrosion and fungal activity
[SPEAKER_00]: that causes this massive destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boxes get destroyed by fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then metals get ruined by all kinds of
other rust and other processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, will you join me in thanking Brad
for everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
