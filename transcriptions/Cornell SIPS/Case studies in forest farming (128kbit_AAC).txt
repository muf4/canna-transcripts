[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Don just mentioned the fact that I
teach a couple of courses, including one
[SPEAKER_02]: called practicum in forest farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a unique course, at least in
the sense that it's taught almost entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors at the McDaniel's Nut Grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures here are shots from the
McDaniel's Nut Grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the students that we've taught
there over the last 12 years and this
[SPEAKER_02]: fellow is Lawrence McDaniels, whose house
Don now lives in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mack came to Cornell in the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_02]: After he cut down all the trees on this
particular site on the south edge of
[SPEAKER_02]: campus, he started planting nut trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though his responsibility was
primarily pomology, apples, and so forth,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was really dedicated to temperate nut
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and a few others in this country,
like J.R.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smith, believed that nut trees could
become a very important source of food for
[SPEAKER_02]: livestock, as well as people on steep
hillsides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good idea as the depression was
approaching, but as things turned out,
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't really take off like they
thought it might because of advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: advances in modern agriculture,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a variety trial, as I say,
for temperate nut trees, walnuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: hickories, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a clonal collection, so it was a
clonal repository.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he learned a lot about the trees
and how they perform and how efficiently
[SPEAKER_02]: they could be grafted onto various
rootstocks and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mack retired in the mid-1950s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about that time when he was sort of
phasing out his involvement in the
[SPEAKER_02]: McDaniel's nut grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was immaterial in letting go of that
and turning on to other pursuits.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, since then, the site sort
of reverted to secondary forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We rediscovered it overgrown with all
sorts of invasives and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: In about 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since then, we've been developing it
as an outdoor teaching site for forest
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple hundred students have passed
through, and it's the students who have
[SPEAKER_02]: contributed a great deal of what you will
see on the ground there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, I and Steve Gabriel,
who also helps me teach the course,
[SPEAKER_02]: we spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, it was the McDaniel's nut
grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: That inspired me to write this book along
with Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Steve Gabriel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here to sell you books today,
but I would like to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we bring up in the book that I
think are important opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: people who have small woodlots and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me tell you what forest farming
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest farming is one of a number of
different agroforestry practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest farming, the one that's penultimate
in my mind, but also alley cropping,
[SPEAKER_02]: riparian buffers, wind breaks,
silvopasture, those are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: cows down there, and forest gardening,
which is distinctly different from forest
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can define forest farming as,
well, the simplest definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an elegant definition by Jean
Grace, my graduate student, under the
[SPEAKER_02]: unique microclimate created by the forest
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, forest farming has to do with
growing non-timber forest crops beneath
[SPEAKER_02]: the canopy of an established forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things can happen under the
northeastern forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: These non-timber forest products fall into
a number of categories, including
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinals, nuts, fruits and other food
crops, tree syrups, ornamentals,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think I missed mushrooms right up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to start with mushrooms,
not only because I'm passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but also because from the standpoint
of advising a woodlot owner, someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in getting involved in their
forest, it's one of the best bets as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as generating some income in a relatively
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good starter crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow shiitake primarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that you can kind of count
on, but there are a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few others that are possible
entries into the commercial world of
[SPEAKER_02]: forest mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lion's mane is one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oyster mushrooms, pretty common,
but they're not very often grown in forest
[SPEAKER_02]: situations, and wine cap stapharia,
which is grown on wood chip beds on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really talking about rot and decay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is all about,
which is what makes it so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you a few case studies
today, introduce you to some of the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that really helped us as we went along in
writing this book, people who have a
[SPEAKER_02]: practical experience with some of these
crops, and I actually learned a lot from
[SPEAKER_02]: these folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These folks are Steve and Julie
Rockcastle.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live, it's a little hard to see,
I think, but they live in the southwest
[SPEAKER_02]: corner of New York State, and they don't
just grow much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow shiitake mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardly anyone that grows shiitake
mushrooms commercially makes their living
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, Steve and Julie have an
organic farm where they have grass-fed
[SPEAKER_02]: beef, also pasture chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not shown here, but their eggs
are, and a couple other crops besides the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, but these guys have a really
unusual source of income.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Great Blue Heron Music
Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have about 100 acres, most of it
woods, and they have a festival out there
[SPEAKER_02]: with about 8,000 people every summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to consider it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to use Steve and Julie as a
vehicle to introduce what I consider to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the six stages of shiitake mushroom
cultivation, and it really, it applies for
[SPEAKER_02]: any mushroom species that grows on wood as
a saprophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, substrate acquisition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fancy way of saying take your
chainsaw out there and cut down live
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Nick Laskowski, who graduated from
Cornell maybe eight years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: six or eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked with me in the Nut Grove,
along with Sonam Sherpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see Sonam here, but anyway,
those two guys really contributed a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: the early development of the site,
and he was the one that taught Steve and
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie how to grow mushrooms, so he's
cutting down trees for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I call stage two,
inoculation out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inoculation is basically introducing the
fungus to the substrate, to the log,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it involves a pretty simple sequence
of things, drilling holes in the log,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then this spawn, as it's called,
is injected into the holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spawn is simply a mixture of sawdust and
the vegetative mycelium of the fungus,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're not talking about spores here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody uses spores in shiitake mushroom
production, so this spawn is injected into
[SPEAKER_02]: those holes, and the holes are waxed off
to prevent the log from drying out too
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm on number three now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colonization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the logs in the laying yard,
and they just lay there for about a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what that's all about is the fungus
begins the process of decay of the log.
[SPEAKER_02]: It colonizes the log.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about a year for a log to become
fully colonized by the fungal mycelium,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the meantime, it is decaying the
log, and white rot fungi like shiitake are
[SPEAKER_02]: really rather unique and kind of amazing
because they and few other creatures on
[SPEAKER_02]: the planet Earth can break down the
complex compound lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lignin is the hard part of wood,
and it's very difficult, biochemically
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, to break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're degrading the wood,
and the wood is turning into more fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium, but also it's going into the
mushrooms that will emerge later on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course, respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through respiration, it's blowing off CO2
and adding water, and that CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it contributes much to
global warming, but often a grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, let me say this, that drying of the
logs is one of the most serious problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: More growers fail growing shiitake because
they let the logs dry out than any other
[SPEAKER_02]: cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that respiration is
adding some of that water back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water's being lost through
evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being added through rainfall,
sometimes irrigation, and when the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms start coming on, water's being
lost from that source too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CO2 loss contribute, or decreases the
dry weight of the log, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think, well, I can just lift
that log, and I know it's lighter than it
[SPEAKER_02]: was last month, and that's true,
but the change in weight is not entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: due to evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also due to carbon dioxide being
blown off into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next stage, once you've got
those logs, you know, I've done it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say one more thing about this,
the fruiting stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great big tank of water,
600 gallons of water, and that's Julie
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Castle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiitake's very good in the sense that the
grower can determine when to produce the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, schedule them very precisely
for the market, whatever that may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the way you do that, once the log is
colonized after that first year,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be placed in water, soaked in water
for 24 hours, and that triggers the
[SPEAKER_02]: process of mushroom formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about a week for the mushrooms to
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you have a Saturday's
farmers market about Thursday of the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous week, you can soak the log and
pretty reliably have those logs,
[SPEAKER_02]: those mushrooms, ready to sell at market
on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, once the mushrooms form,
you have to harvest them, and Julie's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the little pocket knife she has there,
and that's her basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's cutting off the mushroom stalks
and putting them in the basket,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she has that knife for another reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a, the most serious pest problem
with Shiitake mushrooms is not bears,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not deer, it's not poachers,
it's slugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the bane of every mushroom
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slugs are very difficult to manage or to
kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are all sorts of homey recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remedies like wrapping the base of the log
in copper or making a little circle of
[SPEAKER_02]: diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these things work very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the beer traps don't work all that
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Julie does, she goes up there in
the evening, I went with her one time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and she's got that little knife,
and when she sees the slugs crawling up
[SPEAKER_02]: the log, she cuts them in half with the
knife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tells me, busy time of the year,
she'll spend two hours a day doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really brutal, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's come up with, well, I won't say
nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say nobody's come up with a
good control for slugs, except Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabriel has come up with a really
ingenious idea, and I'll show it to you in
[SPEAKER_02]: just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a given season, you can flush a log
three times, and that log will continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: be productive for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now once you have harvested the logs,
you'd better be selling those mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty quick, because they only store for
about a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Steve, there's Julie at the
farmer's market in Buffalo selling fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a farm store, which happens
to be their garage in the basement of
[SPEAKER_02]: their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sell things on a sort of a
you-pick basis, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: A customer comes in and takes fresh
mushrooms, weighs them out, and puts the
[SPEAKER_02]: money in the can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can also get fresh eggs from the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get frozen cuts of beef and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the honor system, because these guys
are too busy to be hanging around the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement all the time, or the carport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to show you also, I said that the
mushrooms don't hang around, fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms don't last that long,
and you're really kind of limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the season is only about five months
long, and after that, you can't be selling
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can be selling value-added
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make several of them at their farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are dried shiitake mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two ounces of dried mushrooms in
there, and they charge $20 for that two
[SPEAKER_02]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hydrate those two ounces back up
with the equivalent fresh weight,
[SPEAKER_02]: would be about 14 ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're actually making $20 on 14
ounces, where if they sell them fresh at
[SPEAKER_02]: the market, they're making $16 for fresh
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can actually make more on the dry
weight basis than the fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a couple of other interesting
products, like shiitake pate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't liver, but it's a paste made of
shiitake mushrooms, cream cheese,
[SPEAKER_02]: and hazelnuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is to die for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, they produce an alcoholic
tincture for what ails you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Julia's very meticulous in record
keeping, and she keeps track of all her
[SPEAKER_02]: expenses and income.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been doing this for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the first year, they started in 2007,
all the way up beyond now in their 2014
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are their expenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just highlighted sort of the combined
expenses in this row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular year, they don't
have any sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that column of sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any sales to offset the
expenses, because as I say, it takes a
[SPEAKER_02]: year for that log to start producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first year, you're spending a
decent amount of money, and you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting any income.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do start to get income after that,
increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the profit, initially, of course,
there's some red ink here.
[SPEAKER_02]: For two years, they're actually losing
money, actually a little bit on the third
[SPEAKER_02]: year too.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, they're starting to make
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by now, they've eliminated this
deficit entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look at these numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this work, and they do a lot of work
for a profit of only $1,300, $2,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: $1,500.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little perplexing to me one of the
things is in the first year, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: making any mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the second year, they're making
some, but not very many, because in their
[SPEAKER_02]: first year, they used red maple logs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And red maple is not a good substrate,
as they have learned and others have
[SPEAKER_02]: learned since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got off to kind of a slow start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, they've gone over to oak and
done better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put in another slide, unrelated,
well, yeah, unrelated to their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that Northeast SARE project that
Don was referring to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here that we basically,
we trained 25 people who wanted to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow shiitake and make money at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took 20 novices and trained them not
only in how to grow the mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's pretty straightforward,
but also taught them some enterprise
[SPEAKER_02]: planning skills so that they could
intelligently go forth and kind of put
[SPEAKER_02]: this into a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this went on for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kept track and fed us and did data
from their expenses, their sales,
[SPEAKER_02]: their income, everything that was
involved, including their labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see here, okay, this is pounds per
bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recall that Steve and Julie were producing
about a quarter to a half a pound per
[SPEAKER_02]: bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a log.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bolt is a log.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas most of these folks, particularly
the ones that made a profit, were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: upwards of a pound, a pound and a half to
two pounds of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I say, I don't really understand
why the difference, but it's important to
[SPEAKER_02]: note that there can be considerable
difference in log production and that
[SPEAKER_02]: concern, mushroom production from a log,
and that can certainly affect the profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the numbers in black here represent
farmers, novice farmers that actually made
[SPEAKER_02]: money on the ordeal, and only several did
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the red.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was impressed that 25 people could
seriously attempt to learn how to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and how to make a business of it,
and most of them, more than half of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: succeeded at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I think, is encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me introduce you to another mushroom
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Steve Serek.
[SPEAKER_02]: His place, Hawk Meadow Farm, is out in
Truman'sburg, not far from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Steve is one of the most experienced
mushroom growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been at it for, I'm not sure,
but I know it's in excess of 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing it for a long time,
and he's very experienced and very good at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I say, nobody makes all their money
on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Steve runs a card business.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a graphic designer, and he sells
these sort of nature-related cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I say, he takes mushroom growing
very seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some shots of his laying yard
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve is of the opinion that oak is the
absolute gold standard for mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just swears by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, he's not locked into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the only one I know who has begun to
look at bitter nut hickory as a source of
[SPEAKER_02]: shiitake substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a lot of that on his land,
and he's found that bitter nut hickory can
[SPEAKER_02]: be an effective substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes on a little later, so that gives
him flexibility as far as timing is
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than use that tank of water to soak
his logs, he has this beautiful stream
[SPEAKER_02]: running right through his property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs all year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Steve loves to get his feet wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that's one of the main
reasons that he grows shiitake mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of his interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he builds these little log rafts so
that the logs won't float down the stream,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he can keep them in there for 24 hours
and put them in the laying yard and
[SPEAKER_02]: produce those mushrooms in another week
and harvest them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has hired or he has gotten two,
well, several Cornell students have taken
[SPEAKER_02]: the forest farming course as interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ben, and this is Hannah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were both out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This summer, it's a real good opportunity,
and he's committed to education of young
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, like I said, he's well organized,
and this is a kind of lousy diagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is the way he's scheduled his
crops so that he'll have mushrooms just
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly when he needs them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't sell farmers market,
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sells to retail to high-end
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a contract to sell
mushrooms to a chef, you better be on
[SPEAKER_02]: time, and you better produce the numbers
that you say you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Steve does is he takes advantage
of different spawn types.
[SPEAKER_02]: These isolates are essentially clones,
and the clones have different
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, like the wide-range
strains, fruit at a higher temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: ranging from 55 to 75, whereas other
strains called cool weather strains fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: at a lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consider the main mushroom season from
the beginning of May until a little way
[SPEAKER_02]: into October.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll take his whole laying yard full of
mushrooms and divide it into seven groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each group here is represented by a stack
of logs, but groups are actually larger
[SPEAKER_02]: than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate, he will take the first
group and soak it on the first day of this
[SPEAKER_02]: sequence of weeks in the beginning of May.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll soak it, he'll take it out,
harvest the mushrooms, and put that log
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the laying yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he'll take the second stack,
soak it, laying yard, and put it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third stack, third week, and all the way
until he's covered all seven stacks in
[SPEAKER_02]: seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's convenient because a log has to
rest between the time it's fruited and it
[SPEAKER_02]: produces mushrooms again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs about a seven-week resting
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time all seven stacks are
completed, he's ready to start with the
[SPEAKER_02]: first stack again, and that's the pink
ones here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go through another seven-week
sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the weather cooperates,
he'll get a third flush, as it were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at the numbers,
these are just rough numbers, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting half a pound per flush,
and often Steve is getting better than
[SPEAKER_02]: that, three flushes per year for three
years and selling at $12 a pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that log is worth more than $50.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit more than you'd get
from that log as firewood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some potential to make money
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, I also wanted to mention the
use of those different strains to
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage as far as scheduling is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool weather strains, they fruit early
in the season when it's too cool for the
[SPEAKER_02]: warm weather strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's getting a total of about two
months extra production time in the spring
[SPEAKER_02]: before the others would come on,
and those same logs, cool weather logs,
[SPEAKER_02]: will fruit again in the fall when it gets
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's really almost doubled his season
through these strategies for season
[SPEAKER_02]: extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, remember, it's sawdust kind of
integrated with the mycelium, and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting about two cubic centimeters in
that hole.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, she's holding that tool right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's plunged that sort of an injector
into the sawdust, stood it over the hole,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just forces it down, and it just
sends a plug of spawn right into the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those bags of spawn can inoculate
about 30 logs, and the bag costs about
[SPEAKER_02]: $25.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cost of the mushroom spawn per log
is really quite reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of issues that are going to
affect the future of mushroom cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: forest mushroom cultivation, one we hope,
and some of the growers are trying out new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains like the lion's mane and the
stropharia and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insurance is something you might not
expect, but we've been surprised to see
[SPEAKER_02]: that there have been quite a few farmers
who have been denied or canceled their
[SPEAKER_02]: farm insurance because they're growing
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these insurance companies,
the agents, they're supposed to be experts
[SPEAKER_02]: at risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what they're worried about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poison mushrooms, you know, you might eat
them instead of shiitake and die,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the chance of coming across a poison
mushroom or a mushroom log are just about
[SPEAKER_02]: nil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gallerina.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's poisonous, but it only affects logs
that are far more rotten, just falling
[SPEAKER_02]: apart compared to the shiitake log when
it's in its prime or even when it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller, and if you know what you're
doing at all, there's really very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very low probability that you're going to
poison somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always say that the risk of the farmer
cutting his leg off with a chainsaw is
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a bit higher than poisoning one of
his customers, his or her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did mention slug control earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a depiction of Steve Gabriel's
forest farm called Spring Meadow Forest
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm out in Mecklenburg, and you can see,
you know, this Carl Whitaker made this
[SPEAKER_02]: drawing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the log with a lot of mushrooms on
it, and these nasty slugs are climbing all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the log, and they're eating those
mushrooms, but the ducks come to save the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve has actually introduced ducks into
his laying yard, and they keep the slugs
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard of anybody doing that,
but it's a really a clever idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess it really works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me shift gears and talk to you a
little bit about forest farming of
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the most prominent
one, the one that almost everyone is
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with, is American ginseng.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very valuable, and I'll talk more about
it, but there are a number of others that
[SPEAKER_02]: are used as medicinal herbs one way or
another, not just these five, but quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy wand, black cohosh, blue cohosh,
snake root, golden seal, but the one to
[SPEAKER_02]: really launch into, you know, whenever we
get questions about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: can I start forest farming, I want to grow
ginseng, the answer isn't always yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the conditions, but there are
basically four different ways to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money growing medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to collect them from the wild,
and a lot of that is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another is to grow these herbs in a forest
garden or a forest farm and harvest the
[SPEAKER_02]: root, for example, for the medicinal
organ, as I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root or the rhizome of the leaves or
whatever, that's the product that the
[SPEAKER_02]: buyers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a forest farmer can specialize in
producing propagules, plants, planting
[SPEAKER_02]: stock, produce seeds, or produce,
in the case of ginseng, these are called
[SPEAKER_02]: rootlets, they're just two-year-old
seedlings, and they're worth about $2 a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece, and a beginning grower can get like
a three-year head start by using those,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the seed, to go from seed to a
finished root can take eight to 10 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then finally, the last one here is
medicinal ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't normally think of medicinal
herbs as being ornamental, but you see
[SPEAKER_02]: American ginseng here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's in these red berries,
it's quite attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things like black cohosh,
just elegant-looking flowers, and they do
[SPEAKER_02]: quite well in a shade garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as ginseng is concerned,
it's a very interesting crop, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: price that a grower can get, or a
grower-collected collector can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: is sort of inversely proportional to how
intensive it is to grow the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild-collected ginseng is not intensive at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: The collector goes out in the woods and
collects the ginseng, doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage the crop beforehand at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's worth $600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most American ginseng is sold to Asian
buyers, to Hong Kong in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the demand for ginseng in Asian
countries is very high, almost insatiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these amazingly high prices
for ginseng on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild-simulated ginseng, you go into the
woods with a handful of seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you scatter them around, and come back
eight years later, and there you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everything has worked out, there are a
lot of problems, but if everything works
[SPEAKER_02]: out, you can have that ginseng ready to
harvest in about eight years, eight to ten
[SPEAKER_02]: years, and since it looks identical to
wild ginseng, you really can't tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth just as much, $600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's woods-cultivated ginseng.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the kind of thing you see in a lot
of forest farming situations, including
[SPEAKER_02]: the McDaniel's Nut Grove, basically raised
beds where ginseng is planted and managed
[SPEAKER_02]: moderately intensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some weeding and some
cultivating and perhaps some use of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides and so forth, so it's
moderately intensive, and yet the price is
[SPEAKER_02]: half of what wild ginseng is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in the lower right here, this is
ginseng grown under artificial shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way they do it in Wisconsin
and Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have these vast structures covered
with shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very expensive to build them,
and you can only use them once.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you've harvested that crop,
you have to move on to a different piece
[SPEAKER_02]: of land that planted at an incredibly high
densities, requires the use of lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicide to keep alternaria and
phytophthora in check.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all that work, you're only getting
$30 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can produce a root instead of eight or
ten years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can produce a root in three or four
years, but it looks like a carrot and has
[SPEAKER_02]: none of the character that a wild root has
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Note the resemblance to a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, ginseng grower I want to introduce
you to is Bruce Fetterplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce lives in somewhere near Norwich,
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: He won't tell you exactly where because
you'd go out and steal his ginseng,
[SPEAKER_02]: but anyway, Bruce, he doesn't look that
dour all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a really nice guy, but look at what
he's up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a buyer of wild furs, ginseng,
deer hides, horns, full line of trapping
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even went out there and he was selling
castor glands from beavers, which mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: men used to use as a lure for trapping
beavers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's as close as anyone I know to a true
mountain man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is standing on one of his woods
cultivated beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce is kind of a clever businessman.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can make money several different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a buyer, well, he collects wild
ginseng, but he also buys wild ginseng
[SPEAKER_02]: from other collectors, and then he sells
it to buyers in New York City and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth, and he makes a good amount of money
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He cultivates some ginseng like this woods
garden right here that he's been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: for quite a while, and like I say,
if he does it right, he can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, $300 to $600 a pound depending on
how he does it, but he also sells seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the seeds are really rather expensive
because they have a two-year dormancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be pre-stratified before you
sell them, and a pound of those seeds cost
[SPEAKER_02]: about $150, and then finally, as I
mentioned before, these are the ginseng
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings or rootlets that he sells in
some quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the one on the bottom I call Bruce's
retirement account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's really a pretty amazing
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce, you know, he plants ginseng every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has about seven acres that he's
planting ginseng on, and he hardly ever
[SPEAKER_02]: harvests any.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started planting about 30 years ago,
and most of it until a couple years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: was still in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: He let these things get bigger and bigger
until they looked something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called man root, not just because it
looks like the pillberry dough boy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because it also is anatomically
correct, if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more so, the more valuable it is,
and the house that ginseng built,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish I had taken pictures of his
house, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: His house is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He built it by hand, and the way ginseng
relates to it is he had all this ginseng
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ground for some of it 30 years old,
and I guess the Rosentis rodenticide label
[SPEAKER_02]: was taken away, so he didn't have access
to a good rodenticide against mice and
[SPEAKER_02]: voles, and so they started ravaging his
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was losing lots and lots of ginseng to
these mice and voles, so he had no choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went and dug it all at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sold it for $150,000, and he tells me
that if the mice hadn't got most of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: he would have made at least a quarter
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he used this money to build this
amazing house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you might be saying that,
well, you can't build that much of a house
[SPEAKER_02]: for $150,000, but Bruce took care of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has 100 acres of trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the logging.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the milling into lumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an experienced carpenter,
and so he built the house from the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and he's a really elegant Finnish
carpenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just looking out his living room
window and a glass representation of
[SPEAKER_02]: ginseng right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk a little bit about minor medicinals,
which is practically everything besides
[SPEAKER_02]: ginseng, although goldenseal is worth,
whereas ginseng is $600 a pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: goldenseal is about $60 a pound,
but that's better than most of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black cohosh, for example, is a so-called
women's herb, and a collector,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who's collecting it from the wild
or growing it in a garden, can get about
[SPEAKER_02]: $3 a pound for the dried root,
and it's just hardly worth the trouble of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it for five years if you're only
gonna get $3 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are ways around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beth root, or as we know it, trillium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy wand is an interesting crop,
and blood root, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave Carmen is a retired telephone
executive who lives in West Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he specializes in growing not so much
the roots of the organ of medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: interest, but rather planting stock for
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about a quarter acre or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of his overall garden,
and he tells me that in this block he has
[SPEAKER_02]: about 30 different plants, and it just
looks like a random mix, but I think Dave
[SPEAKER_02]: knows where every single plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about six different plants
represented right here in this roughly a
[SPEAKER_02]: square meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also developing a steep hillside with
terraces, and he just enjoys doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: and has time to do it, and makes some
money at it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of his favorite crops, most valued
crops, is fairy wand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful flower there, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he starts this in little small seedbed,
grows the plants for, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: several months to a year, pricks them out,
transfers them to a raised bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then after a couple more years,
he transfers them, transplants them out
[SPEAKER_02]: into the garden, into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't use containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a total of six years,
the plant is ready to be dug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dave is a pretty small, light guy,
so he really has to wail on that shovel to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it down where the roots are,
and so he's digging it out of the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: there, and well, that's him doing it
again, but he'll take one of these big,
[SPEAKER_02]: fibrous root systems about like that from
a six-year-old plant, and he'll divide it
[SPEAKER_02]: into several pieces with chute associated
with each one, put it in a plastic bag
[SPEAKER_02]: with sphagnum moss, and ship that out to
buyers, to people who want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he does a couple of other money-making
things with the same crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He collects and sells seed, and the seeds
shatter from the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're ripe, they'll just drop to
the ground and pretty much be lost,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so he'll put these little bags,
mesh bags, over them to prevent the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from getting lost, and then because fairy
wand is worth about $60 a pound dry root,
[SPEAKER_02]: he will actually sell some of it that way,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other crop that he grows that he's
really proud of is Virginia snake root.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not particularly ornamental,
and it doesn't grow around here as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it's further south of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower, well, the seed is valuable,
and the flower is very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right down here at ground level
underneath the leaves, and once it matures
[SPEAKER_02]: and sets seed, the seeds just fall,
and you've lost them once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: so he has this really clever mechanism for
collecting the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a flower stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's one right there coming from
the crown of the plant, and he has these
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum vials with a transparent lid,
takes it apart, and he's got a slot in the
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sets the stalk, the flower stalk,
right into that groove, and the flower is
[SPEAKER_02]: now inside the vial, caps it off,
and it's already been pollinated after
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever period of time, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds drop right into the vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've never seen anyone do anything
like that, but that way he collects the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds at a dollar a piece, and he also
lines some of the snake root out in a
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant bed and sells some of it that
way, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's American ginseng, again,
at Dave's place, Dave Carmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't dig any root at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't have any voles, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what he does is he grows the plant,
and this is a very old plant, for seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Bruce doesn't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce fed it to the place, but he finds it
necessary to cover the seed heads with
[SPEAKER_02]: these mesh bags and collect the seed that
way, and as I say, the seeds are worth
[SPEAKER_02]: $150 a pound, so it seems to be
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's the last one I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, we're pretty much up to
time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I wanted to talk about one other
couple that do forest farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Dave and Diane Kornman.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very confusing, because they're
both Dave, and the spelling of their name
[SPEAKER_02]: is practically the same, but this is
Kornman, and the other one was Carmen,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have a really beautiful nursery
in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just immaculate, and it's a pleasure
to go there, just walking through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a shot from their website,
and here's typical raised beds within
[SPEAKER_02]: their nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very prolific, and they built
these two beautiful little outhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not outhouses, small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small outbuildings, that's what I meant to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks a little sloppy, but they
actually specialize in trilliums,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is right after the trillium crop
was pretty much finished and dug and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little trashy, but the next
slide you can see more typical,
[SPEAKER_02]: well-ordered forest nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants are in these raised beds in a
compost mixture, and others are being
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in containers over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned before, black cohosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it too often, but when it's in
bloom, it's just very impressive.
Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actaea resimosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he grows it in containers, and he sells
those containers for about $20 a piece,
[SPEAKER_02]: and remember, the root is only worth $3 a
pound, so this is really a value-added
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bed of his Actaea, or black
cohosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this thing isn't medicinal at all,
but you probably recognize the yellow lady
[SPEAKER_02]: slipper, cipripedium.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the few people I've seen who
actually grow cipripediums and sell them
[SPEAKER_02]: for a phenomenal price.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is illegal to dig wild cipripediums,
and if you collect seed from your own,
[SPEAKER_02]: scatter it around, forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No germination at all, because they have a
very tight symbiosis with a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: type of fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really can't grow it from seed
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way you can get it reliably is to
have it grown in tissue culture at a
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized lab like Spangle Creek Labs up
in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave buys the seedlings from Spangle Creek
and gets them out into the raised bed and
[SPEAKER_02]: grows them on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even see here, I thought you could
see some flower heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, these aren't far from
flowering, and he'll sell one flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, takes about, I think about three
years to get there, for $60 a plant.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time's up, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ginseng too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aquatic plants, and that's all I have to
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: When medical marijuana becomes legal in
New York State, do you expect some forest
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers to start growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you mention the difference between
forest gardening and forest farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what is that difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, forest farming is starting to grow
non-cubic forest crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneath the canopy of an established
forest, forest gardening is starting from
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch, and basically growing a forest
using forest ecological principles and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A forest of edible cannabis and used
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bottom up, top down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, do mushroom growers ever find that,
or ever produce their own spawn after a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years, or is it always more than 30?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as far as shiitake is concerned,
some people do it, it's just because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're fanatic and stuff, because they
really enjoy being in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at $25 for 30 logs, really high
quality spawn doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're interested in cultivating
lion's mane or oyster and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go out into the woods,
harvest plants, get them into culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: and make them into spawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few people do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that as part of the research
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me talk about slugs attacking mushroom
crops, at least in this part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the main problematic one the big,
basic leopard slug?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the slugs that I see on mushrooms are
little tiny things, and I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're named.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the big guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just ask Geneva if they have any
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two people?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently not.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Ken, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
