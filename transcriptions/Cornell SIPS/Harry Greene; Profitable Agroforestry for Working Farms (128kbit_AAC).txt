[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Propagate Ventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll dive right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, this is a photo looking down a
windbreak, which is also an irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: canal, but it's one of our favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most all of these photos, we've taken
across different farms in different states
[SPEAKER_01]: and countries and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any questions, just maybe write them
down and happy to dive in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But agenda for the day, we'll go into an
overview of how we work as a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our general pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at a product demo or analysis
snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll review overyield as a concept,
so how trees and crops together are more
[SPEAKER_01]: productive than managing them separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw up a few agroforestry farms in the
Finger Lakes, and then we'll look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what's been recently interesting and
what's upcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ag and farming get a whole lot of
attention in the news in the climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change discussion, and they've really
become a focal point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so often we see images like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually former Amazon or Amazon
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanna move this, at least at the
onset, towards something more like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So agroforestry, it's a super old concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weed and poplars here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a current iteration of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's known to be about 40 times,
excuse me, 40% more productive than,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, traditional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll dive into how that works in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But say if agroforestry were incorporated
onto a fraction of US farmland,
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon data looks like those
offsetting about 10% of annual emissions,
[SPEAKER_01]: US annual emissions every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with returns, at or below 5%,
farmers are looking for alternatives like
[SPEAKER_01]: apples, chestnuts, and timber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not necessarily easy to add tree
crops to farmland because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: operational, business, and financial
challenges in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've chosen to do is address
these obstacles, which really unlocks
[SPEAKER_01]: farmland, ag productivity, and investment
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four third parties looking to invest in
region ag and specifically agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really what Angel List did
for startups and Wonder Capital did for
[SPEAKER_01]: solar, if y'all are looking for some
analogs to our business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I guess I can walk you
through how we look at farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a design for about 200 acres of
chestnuts and elderberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not investing in just not just
forestry or just kind of R&D as an end
[SPEAKER_01]: into itself, but actually owning trees on
land along commercial from trees from the
[SPEAKER_01]: land itself as bankable assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to walk you through how we do it,
it starts with de-risking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks apply and run through an analysis
process and look at everything within a
[SPEAKER_01]: context of how a farm operates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use the holistic management
framework from the Savory Institute to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at, what do a set of land managers
want out of their lives and land?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we look into costs,
revenues, yields, and labor assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a few slides on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use financial metrics like NPV,
value, internal rate of return,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, kind of traditional financial
analysis to really just elucidate how
[SPEAKER_01]: agroforestry adds financial value to the
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So revenue for different crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor is something to be interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just how many dollars it takes to
manage a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how many people is it going to take to
operationalize that farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, say, 20 people for an apple
orchard, that could flip down to one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two people if it's a timber system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So context alignment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We qualify projects and then group them
into funds, which are diversified across
[SPEAKER_01]: crop types and geographies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funds, cohorts that de-risk each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once farms are qualified, connect them
with investors and commercial buyers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a key part of getting all of
these fruit, nut, and timber crops to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then profit share partnership between
farmers, land managers, and investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is our team up until very
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have Audrey on the call as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's our new director of business
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have three more people,
so up to a team of seven, joining us by
[SPEAKER_01]: February.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just succinctly recap that
agroforestry econ, data analytics,
[SPEAKER_01]: project development tools, so brokering
trees needed to meet investment
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations, de-risking tree crops,
and connecting land managers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The financing to scale agroforestry into a
cornerstone of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to switch applications now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just jump into a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a farm in Hudson, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about four hours from Ithaca,
or three and a half or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on 120 acres total, 50 acres open.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mostly a chestnut and black
currant combo polyculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zoom in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange rose or chestnuts, purple rose or
black currant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else are things like black
locust, curly poplar, or biodeficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if the graphs load.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, I guess we can imagine
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess Google is slowing down how fast
they push graphs to Notion and other
[SPEAKER_01]: external programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll go through total capital
required to bring a system to break even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cumulative earnings, internal rate of
return, NPV, which we'll work through
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cash flows, the discount rate that we use
for the NPV, full-time land manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many full-time equivalent
positions?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many jobs a certain project is going
to create?
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just did an analysis for an
organization down in Pennsylvania that's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at water quality and what would
scaling profitable agroforestry-based
[SPEAKER_01]: riparian buffers look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of jobs that scaled up just
riparian management and say elderberry
[SPEAKER_01]: processing would create was super
interesting to dive into.
[SPEAKER_01]: This site was fallow for four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we moonscaped it once and then planted
cover crop just to kick back the sycamore
[SPEAKER_01]: and the goldenrod and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roam mulched everything with hardwood
bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's all organic protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty keen on the uptake in price
from organic products and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing we're doing is
using raked hay as mulch, so growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: situ biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with that, we should jump back
into the keynote.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can return to all those other concepts
in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in a little bit, maybe in the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to over-yield as a concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really one of our favorite words to
describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you have over-yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 140% statistic, it's kind of a
fundraiser, so we're going to dive into
[SPEAKER_01]: what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plantation forestry on the left,
so that's just trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain-based ag on the right, just grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both canopies are 2D.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to do is take advantage of
the vertical space with agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, if they're just harvested alone,
on the left, that's a poplar plantation I
[SPEAKER_01]: visited in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 70,000 acres of just wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these figures are just for today's
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If an acre of wood yields 100 units of
wood and an acre of wheat yields 100 units
[SPEAKER_01]: total.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the combination, you get less
wood and less wheat or less understory
[SPEAKER_01]: crop per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: But together, see, it's 140 units total at
the bottom of the left column.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a greater yield per acre in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two acres, whereas you have 200 units
here, you get 280 units here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 140% over-yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Examples of this that are really tangible
for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polonia, so empress polonia tomatosa and
wheat, and I guess other understory grain
[SPEAKER_01]: crops in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really good data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pulling a few data points or talking
points out of that, with rows of trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: 130 to 160 feet apart or so, depending on
the crop and the year, it yielded 99 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 104% of the control yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by planting trees, they actually
increased crop yields between corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat, soy, and cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly with wheat, just because it's a C3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's less zero sum than corn,
which is C4 in terms of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at the latitude of the border of
South and North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe it has the climate more like
Missouri, just because they have these
[SPEAKER_01]: cold fronts that come down from Siberia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one of these, I guess,
over-yield common systems is silvopasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a combination of trees, forage,
and livestock data points here.
[SPEAKER_01]: On hot days in Kentucky, cattle gain 60%
more weight when they have access to tree
[SPEAKER_01]: shade or produce 20% more milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big bump in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 200,000 acres of this in the
North of Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: I visited some of that in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually grow yerba mate there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a wood and mate or wood
and cattle situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have the monocrops of all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bump in yield from the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the increased economic returns from
trees at wider spacing arises,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you have trees really close
together, they grow up as spindly pulpwood
[SPEAKER_01]: thin logs that you can't really mill into
any economically meaningful amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: lumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the trees have more space,
you get fatter logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go from producing pulpwood to
producing saw logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just over-yield of ag
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over-yield of income.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we communicate that over-yield
of income over the 30 plus years that an
[SPEAKER_01]: agroforestry system is going to be a
working farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we touched on a little bit of that in
the snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we use is modern financial
analysis to value tree crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess these are the main topics,
titles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a slide on each.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time value of money, we have to ask,
what $100 is worth to us today versus that
[SPEAKER_01]: same $100 received to us in 10 years is
different, because now it's available for
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works into the opportunity cost of
having or not having dollars in value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the time value of money,
we can express, say, in 2020 dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it worth to us if we were to earn
$100 in 2030 or if we earn $10 every year
[SPEAKER_01]: between now and 2030?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that worth to us in today's
dollars?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when value in tree crops, that's
something that is totally imperative to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate their value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we add all of those net income,
we'll say, bottom of the spreadsheet,
[SPEAKER_01]: add up all of their present values.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the net present value of the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to borrow money from the bank
to, let's say, operational expenditures of
[SPEAKER_01]: a system, the internal rate of return is
the interest rate that the bank would have
[SPEAKER_01]: to charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: To eat up all of our profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy to explain more of that in the Q
&A, if need be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the greater the IRR, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this sort of analysis, what was,
I guess, not surprising, but kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reassuring to us is that it's applicable
across socioeconomic groups, even for,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, subsistence farmers who are growing
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it might not be dollar return on
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be, say, caloric return on
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this kind of discounting
process is applicable to any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, be that pounds, calories,
dollars, nutrients, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a few more examples of over
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a poplar silvopasture system that
I got to visit in Argentine Patagonia a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a wood-scarce place,
so it makes sense for them to grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just run-of-the-mill type of timber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Argentina is a big beef-producing
country, so cattle in the understory.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's in, it's kind of like northern
New Mexico, the climate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some chestnut silvopasture in
eastern Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just really using the cattle as
lawnmowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chestnuts are the main value prop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just takeaways here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to screenshot this if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to succinctly review kind of what
we've just gone through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the trees and the understory have to
create positive economic returns for over
[SPEAKER_01]: yield to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clarifying on that, saying that we can
grow something in the understory is,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, that we can combine a tree to
overstory with an understory is much more
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant when the trees and the understory
are both profitable in a way that aligns
[SPEAKER_01]: with a context of a land manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how we've chosen to operate in this
department is just to make tree crop
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomy as agronomy for annual grains and
livestock production is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're spurring familiarity in order to
make trees a bankable asset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna take a breather here,
have some hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually live up in Truman'sburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a lot of folks on the webinar
today, that's super close to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 12 miles north of Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually moved to this region,
to the Finger Lakes, because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: presence of agroforestry that's already
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few farms that are doing it really
well, the Finger Lakes Cider House,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see apples and asparagus here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say it's one of the most beautiful
agroforestry sites in temperate climate
[SPEAKER_01]: North America that's masquerading as a
cider house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't been up there,
highly recommended, go walk around,
[SPEAKER_01]: have some cider and food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peaches in the summer, pick your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do Thanksgiving turkeys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the turkeys actually decrease pest
damage from asparagus beetle to an
[SPEAKER_01]: economically meaningful extent and
decrease the pest load on the peaches,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just selling meat,
but actually making the fruit system work
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick strawberries, you can see the
turkeys and the apples in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is Wellspring Forest Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve and Liz Gabriel, what they've
done is super interesting how they thin
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of existing early successional
forest, feeding things like honeysuckle
[SPEAKER_01]: and buckthorn to sheep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then actually getting more,
what was undervalued kind of trebland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also do shiitake mushrooms and ducks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is actually underneath a
maple canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the tubing in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then thirdly Angus Lent Farm over in Kins
Glen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is black locust, black walnut
silvopasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett Chedzoy was a Peace Corps volunteer,
I believe in the early nineties or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: came back and on his family's former dairy
farm, planted silvopasture because saw
[SPEAKER_01]: that, saw silvopasture in Argentina and
now has a hundred head of cattle on 300
[SPEAKER_01]: acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also converting existing forest into
silvopasture, doing it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maintaining the health of the trees,
so not set stocking and trampling the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really beautiful landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cattle come in during hot days and eat
everything in the understory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I'm just going to time check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been interesting for us,
Saskatoon serviceberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great tasting berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less acid than blueberries,
more floral flavor, ripens two to four
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks earlier than blueberries or
currants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for you pick purposes, this farm
right here is called Juneberry Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually up in Ovid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also do pick your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in the area, highly
recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guy, his name is, he's a great guy to go
and hang out with as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So serviceberry, what's interesting,
you can use the same mechanical harvester
[SPEAKER_01]: for black currant, serviceberry,
aronia, maybe beech plum and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically staggering the harvest and
better distributing that capital
[SPEAKER_01]: expenditure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over different crops and in different
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one actually connected with Larry
Smart of Cornell on this front,
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass willow kind of with the cost of
petroleum as being a substitute right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not often profitable to grow willow
for chips and then burn it for energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But feeding that willow to cattle can
actually offset hay costs as a reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: lower maintenance return, especially for
riparian zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So riparian are kind of low lying
saturated soil that would otherwise get
[SPEAKER_01]: plugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pugging is when kind of cows punch through
the soil with their hooves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill the wet spots with willow,
have the cattle eat it in say the late
[SPEAKER_01]: fall or winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder to do winter grazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cattle can't use their horns or their nose
or their hooves to brush off the snow like
[SPEAKER_01]: they can in Montana or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that biomass, that food above
ground is a great substitute for hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's upcoming and interesting for us
are, I'll give two examples of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess three things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea buckthorn, it's a nutraceutical,
super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are 3 million acres of it across
so Siberia, Mongolia, China.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're curious in how to best mechanize it
and what the returns are for growing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: this climate or kind of over into
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that's upcoming is looking
at across latitudes and geographies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the optimal number of acres of
silvopasture that a farm would do well to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many hot days are there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many days over a certain heat
index?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one input cell we'll say,
and then how many units of dry matter do
[SPEAKER_01]: they need on those hot days?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a forage species in the
understory, cool vishers, warm trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: grasses, C3, C4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we make the data sets from
different latitudes and places talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: forecast optimal number of acres and
silvopasture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same deal with windbreaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another photo from Argentina on
the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I mean, it's a photo of me,
but if you look at the background of these
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, these windbreak systems,
it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the questions that we want to answer
are how often are our winds, how much
[SPEAKER_01]: weight gain, how much weight loss do we
have, and then what are the costs and the
[SPEAKER_01]: revenues of managing a windbreak over 30
years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're coming up on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just takeaways, agroforestry creates
over yields, uses time value of money to
[SPEAKER_01]: elucidate the financial value of perennial
ag, and then de-risking trees creates
[SPEAKER_01]: trees as a bankable asset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we didn't go over too much,
but yeah, that's the scoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we have some time for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will ask anyone in the audience if
they have questions for Harry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if people would prefer, they can
certainly put their questions in the chat
[SPEAKER_02]: box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yep, Harry, you did just what I was
about to ask, which is getting off the
[SPEAKER_02]: shared screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So questions from anyone in the audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets for some of these crops in the
Northeast.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So holes from Michael Snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets for some of these crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say chestnuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of demand from recent
immigrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Koreans, Bosnians, Chinese,
et cetera, more in the urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selling retail prices differ pretty
drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackcurrant is really an ingredient
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans aren't super familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, in terms of blackcurrant in a
product that has the similar quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: minute made, we have things like grape
juice, but say blackcurrant in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer, wine, et cetera, that's a bit more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then black locust decking is a
substitute for the synthetic decking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lasts for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want black locust decking right
now, most of it's imported actually from
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So processing, there are existing
processors for a lot of things like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we'll say off season apple
infrastructure for juicing different
[SPEAKER_01]: fruits that fruit earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juicing, fermenting, refrigerating,
transporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like look at rented space and not
spending more on newer capital
[SPEAKER_01]: expenditures that are necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a black locust mill in
Ithaca, Newfield, black locust lumber,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we model everything for different
regions with a custom sawyer coming on
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How small is the minimum land for an
agroforestry project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say if a farmer wanted to beef up the
riparian buffers on his or her farm from
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 feet to 100 feet wide and convert it to
agroforestry to maintain economic return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum land for an agroforestry project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally depends on the crop type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like one acre of blueberry you pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would totally work out if we define
agroforestry as just diversifying with
[SPEAKER_01]: perennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It scales up and scales down really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smallest farm we're working on is 30
acres of growing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, converting buffer agroforestry is
pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the cost of taking land out of
production and like say you have to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the highest number of crop species
you use in an agroforestry system?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like there's only one species in
some of the systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Association and rotation without
complicating management too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends if we're going for insect,
fungal, plant diversity, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say every 10th row is a row of
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those insects can fly into the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We highlight maybe three core economic
species, but the biodiversity species are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say unlimited,
but maybe up to 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that's based on what the Xerces
Society says are good species for a region
[SPEAKER_01]: for insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a general process to follow in
determining what species and plants to put
[SPEAKER_01]: on a farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: How site specific do you get when picking
plant communities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very site specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that has to do with just the
biogeophysical climate, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate between the ears of a set of farm
managers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what works for their lifestyle and
their land and their current system and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a long process of holistic
context development there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Sam, speak to the experience of
propagate finding research on agroforestry
[SPEAKER_01]: systems in the Northeast and how an
institution like Cornell could help
[SPEAKER_01]: advance agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding research on agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do on that front is dive into a
lot of university and NGO white papers on
[SPEAKER_01]: different crops and say, read four by 75
pages, synthesize the info and make text.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell is great for that with new crops
coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grad students writing up a,
there's one established, just top of mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: establishing organic black currents in
maritime Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the more you dig, the more you
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely keep going on that front.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Mel, what amount of supply is there
for crops like these in terms of nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: presence?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an elephant in the room in the
nursery world because a bunch of nurseries
[SPEAKER_01]: have frankly retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So efficient nurseries growing a lot of
these crops is definitely an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nursery hustle is very real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going out and finding different nurseries,
some that have unique genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily the easiest order from
ordering trees is not like ordering off of
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any income generated by
incorporating plant nurseries into your
[SPEAKER_01]: systems with plants that can be harvested
for cuttings like willow and blackcurrant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a possibility, but that's not our
core focus right now, though it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From James, mentioned black walnut
agroforestry in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice example using moldy purpose trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: To offset long-term econ of growing
boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other examples of multi-purpose trees
in the North?
[SPEAKER_01]: James, if you could just follow up on that
one with just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: clarification there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from Peter Woodbury, can you talk
about examples or plans for building up
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing and supply chains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give two examples of buyers,
brewery and supplements brand and an egg
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pastured organic raised organic egg
brand wants to diversify their pastures
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can't grow crops,
but they can grow trees that the chickens
[SPEAKER_01]: integrate into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then say breweries are interested in
buying different fruit for their beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplements brands interested in
elderberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we create that stack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holly Stevenson, do you use any forestry
management techniques to assist in land
[SPEAKER_01]: management, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed burning, invasive species
management?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forestry mulching is a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like a wood chipper on the front
of either a bobcat or a bulldozer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescribed burning is one of our farms in
Maryland did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't done that as a company yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very interested in prescribed
burning just as an alternative to tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mark Phillips, what are good
agroforestry pathways for diversified
[SPEAKER_01]: organic veg farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say things that already use the
existing refrigeration and processing
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So small fruit is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put this in the chat here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: To send chat to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: La Durette is a market garden and fruit
combo in the south that's doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Nat Stein, do you work at all
with agrivoltaic, like incorporating solar
[SPEAKER_01]: panels of livestock?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the pipeline as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big, very large solar system
that has sheep underneath it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: southeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have extra land where it didn't make
sense to put solar panels, but they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see that value analog between
solar and trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone's grazing solar, then it's a
good fit to then go from solar pasture to
[SPEAKER_01]: silvopasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helloagriculture.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would a greenhouse space be required for
plant nursery or open feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps just to de-risk weather events
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen people grow blueberries and
raspberries and peaches underneath high
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnels for frost protection and whatnot
and just season extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that answered that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what about herbs and medicinal
plants integrated in your operations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that profitable?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a market for it and the
processing works out and it fits with the
[SPEAKER_01]: context, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting ones there is
schisandra vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't modeled it yet, but I would love
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbs and medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of questions about hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I'm sure a lot of folks have seen,
it's been a big boom and bust crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thankfully avoided getting pulled
into the CBD craze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking a bunch, but any other
questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we doing on time, Sam?
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there were more questions,
we would be able to accommodate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marvin Pritz gave an introduction to a
lot of these lesser known berry crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: our berry production class today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was super cool to see how they're
being economically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked a lot about the economics of
these integrated agroforestry systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does carbon sequestration kind of fit
in to all this with you were saying you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to reduce tillage and have you
modeled any of the carbon sequestration
[SPEAKER_00]: and long-term benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon itself with trees feels really
easy to model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to model and have an input
cell for the price of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But assuring what that price of carbon
will be is the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote an article about this economic
reality of agroecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the title that dives into a deeper
version of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a few ways that that works
out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we're addressing this is via kind
of creating those ecosystem services as a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive externality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just doing it anyway and the crops make
the econ work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is having a municipality,
not a carbon market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a single buyer pay for ecosystem
services, be those carbon or water quality
[SPEAKER_01]: payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ecosystem services markets in the US
are generally underdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do definitely keep tabs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not necessarily holding our
breath right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other question I see from Michael
Snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we find equipment for mechanizing
these operations?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for berries in particular, that's what
you want to Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically shrub fruit mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question that we always ask is how
do we model systems to use readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available equipment that farmers already
have to manage these systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to go out and buy another
$20,000 piece of machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we use a rotary rake integrated
into an agroforestry system?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a basic hang implement that everyone
has or like a bale chopper to mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a fun rabbit hole in
mechanization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from Holly Stevenson,
do you ever model your systems after other
[SPEAKER_01]: types of ecosystems like savannas or
prairies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely on savannas and prairies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wide silber pasture spacing kind of
mimics that, that sparse tree system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then wide spacing for alley cropping
for grain might also mimic that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Harry, based on the number of questions
that came in in the chat, I would say that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a great deal of interest in your
subject and your methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we had a terrific turnout today
so late in the semester.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank you for sharing so much
about how your firm is not only working
[SPEAKER_02]: today, but also looking to the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess Dawn and Sam and Catalina,
thank you so much for hosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate the opportunity to
come in and share what we're up to with
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email is just harry at
propagateventures.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome anyone to follow up there or on
social media, we're just propagateventures
[SPEAKER_01]: on Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this Nat asked if this is being
recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think it will be up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure when exactly, but yeah,
that'll be available to go back and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: decipher things that I've said quickly or
just- It will be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you quite how soon,
but it will be on the section of
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks again, Harry, and farewell to
all of you from the fall semester.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will hope to see you again in
February.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
