[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is really a big honor for me to
be given an opportunity to visit Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Cornell, we give this
university high regard in the Philippines,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially there in our university,
and share to you what we have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also thankful to Dr. Matson
because of being patient on how we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: through this scholarship, this fellowship,
during the COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I'm here, I'm so glad to meet
his team at the KPL and meet everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, share to you today what we
have in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have been involved in the
promotion of urban agriculture in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines, particularly the technology
of hydroponics and aquaponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: and greenhouses, urban agriculture,
and a controlled environment, controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the Philippines, investment
and funding is the very big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we try to do whatever we have there,
locally available materials, just to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start with, I want to first talk
about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born in this little island in the
Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call Malibuke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has six towns, and it is situated in
the central part of the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent my childhood there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my childhood is not East.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are just struggling, coconut farming
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thank our parents that they taught us
how to go through with our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spent my elementary and high school
in this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given an opportunity to go through
Central Zone State University to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: Bachelor of Science in Agricultural
Engineering where I graduated in 1983.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my study is all about rice combines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also took up Master of Science in
Agricultural Engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I graduated in 1989, focusing on the
automation of pressurized irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: systems using soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I pursued my PhD in Agricultural
Engineering, completing it by 2008,
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on water management systems for
hydroponic energy balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, I was sent to University of Arizona
in Blue Zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completed a six-month scholarship
program under Fulbright in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my study is all about integration of
freshwater prawn in aquaponics systems for
[SPEAKER_01]: tilapia, lettuce, pak choi, and cabbage
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, I am here at Cornell with
this advanced research and university
[SPEAKER_01]: lecturing program under Fulbright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am focusing on the study on the
effect of pH on the growth and yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of carotenoid content with Dr.
Patz.
[SPEAKER_01]: After graduation, I went to the Middle
East for six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became an agricultural engineer,
landscaping engineer, irrigation engineer,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything there in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are installing and maintaining rip
irrigation systems, sprinklers in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and open field for the RRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also involved in the
establishment of modern farms and water
[SPEAKER_01]: management for pressurized irrigation
systems in the Sultanate of Oman,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the Sultan had given lands to the
Omanis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our company participated a lot in those
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I settled in the Philippines for
good, I started as a substitute teacher,
[SPEAKER_01]: high school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Central Islam State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I persevered until I became a
professor at the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering in
that university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach agricultural and biosystems
engineering subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the subjects that I love is all
about advanced techniques to crop growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and culture, which focuses on the things
that I love to do all about hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics, and control agriculture
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later that when the COVID hit the
Philippines, the Secretary of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: called some of the researchers in
Philippine universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was instructed to lead the Urban
Farming Innovation Center, wherein we are
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting urban agriculture with
innovative technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we establish demonstration farms,
especially in Metro Manila and other big
[SPEAKER_01]: cities in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also assist and provide suggestions in
the policy making and implementation of
[SPEAKER_01]: urban agriculture in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Central Islam State University is
located there in the central part of
[SPEAKER_01]: Luzon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is about 100 to 150, about four
hours drive from Metro Manila,
[SPEAKER_01]: the capital city of the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the early developments in CLSU is when
I had this design of automatic irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers for low-cost, using low-cost
soil moisture activated controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that great ideas started
from group ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started from group ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we employ these in our studies and
research in our chart of the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, I was called by our university to
lead the establishment of a demonstration
[SPEAKER_01]: farm using the Israeli greenhouses and
technologies for the production of honey
[SPEAKER_01]: to melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not yet doing that in soilless
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were able to produce superior
quality of honey to melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, I pursued my PhD and I focused on
the hydroponic honey to melon,
[SPEAKER_01]: on water management of hydroponic honey to
melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my study.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see in the pictures,
we do not have such systems that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to invest in our own system
using the locally available materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later, I was sent by Fulbright to
University of Arizona, where I had this
[SPEAKER_01]: integration of prawn with tilapia and
vegetables in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is actually the result of this
available online published under the
[SPEAKER_01]: scholarship publishing house in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can see my faculty professor,
Dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons, and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: prawns that we have grown in this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prawn is located under the raft
system, not with the tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while in the University of Arizona,
I also involved myself in the production
[SPEAKER_01]: of tomatoes, mushrooms, and controlled
environment of the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a lot of knowledge about what
they are doing there in Biosphere 2 and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Lunar Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I attended lectures on how they do
this, which probably I can use when I go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is my report.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm going to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many publications that tell
us that scientists all over the world
[SPEAKER_01]: agree that today's agricultural production
systems are not any more suitable for the
[SPEAKER_01]: new food security challenges of our
century.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, prevailing farm systems cannot
meet the food requirements of the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first tier in this diagram,
you can see an area in orange bounded by
[SPEAKER_01]: the red and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 2010 to 2050, that area is
increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that the food requirement of
the population is increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably, according to scientists,
by 2030, which is seven years from now,
[SPEAKER_01]: in many parts of the world, there will be
severe hunger, which would result to
[SPEAKER_01]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would threaten the peace in the
globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Philippines, despite the advances
that we have in modern agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is from farm mechanization that the
government is pursuing, to protected
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation onto plant genetics,
food production, especially in our
[SPEAKER_01]: country, remains at the mercy of the
changing climate, subject to various
[SPEAKER_01]: destructive elements of natural and
manmade disasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other serious interrelated
problems, like overpopulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: urban migration, and aging farmers,
and of course, corruption, because we are
[SPEAKER_01]: popular with corruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on the United Nations projection
as of today, we will have a population of
[SPEAKER_01]: 117 million, more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is scattering in only 300,000
square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to study that,
that is six times greater than the
[SPEAKER_01]: population of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we are ranking about 1.46% of
the total world population, ranking number
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a small factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the population density is about
384,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people per square kilometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Metro Manila alone, that colored area
there, composed of several small cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the fourth world's most crowded
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking of the city of Manila,
this one, it is the most densely populated
[SPEAKER_01]: city in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the big problems that we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because of this, people want to
go to the cities, to urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live on the countryside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not want to be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2015, it is about 51.2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rural population is about 48.8%.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 2020, it had increased to 54%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leaving the old farmers in the local
communities to work on the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the average age of Filipino farmers
now is between 57 to 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just imagine that age will be working in
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be a critical shortage of
farm workers within 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually it's happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our youth love to stay in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many computers, they love, they don't
want till the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the impact of climate change in
our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Filipino agriculture is sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have accepted that and dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its contribution to the country's GDP has
dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And continues to decline over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetable industry alone is almost in
comatose condition because every year we
[SPEAKER_01]: are devastated by so many natural
disasters, especially typhoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers' financial condition continues
to worsen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dignity crushed and devastated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why farmers found farming not
profitable anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an attractive business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were forced to sell their lands to
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lately we, a big typhoon,
destructive typhoon has busted the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the regions in the northern part of
the Philippines were devastated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we are an agricultural country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are one of the highest-run importer
of rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we are a rice-eating country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of this, when I arrived from
Tucson, from Arizona, I thought it is back
[SPEAKER_01]: proper for me to utilize what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I submitted proposals to the
government, particularly in the Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was awarded of six projects from
2012 to 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to develop this demo
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this demo farm, that has become a
center of promotion of modern technology
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, what we have there is not
similar to your high-tech technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a proof that we Filipinos can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in our own small way, using locally
available materials and our engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to produce some researches
and result of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow beefsteak and cherry tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technology has been shared to many
people, especially those in commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sample, this setup is scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can even improve this because this
is our prototype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using our locally available materials,
especially nutrient solution, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: become the biggest problem in the
hydroponic industry in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to produce our own hydroponic
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We formulate our own and share this to the
government and have it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the systems that we have are scalable
from commercial to backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our backyard system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can grow here, leafy vegetables and
birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably you will see how these plants
can grow in this system because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sunrise will not be available to all the
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we first harvest on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every harvest, we promote everyone and
we start from the bottom again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will include labors, but just to
maximize the space and the investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be a smaller version of
this we call household model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's smaller, but it depends because
the capacity of our investors is limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we have this one square meter
garden, which can be established in
[SPEAKER_01]: condominiums and small areas, even in our
roof decks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we use this as a system for
aquaponics, one square meter garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use the discarded fruit boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To contain the transolution and plant
their lettuces like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our system that we use for
tomato production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow we were able to do some
research about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we can improve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this we always tell to our farmers,
to our investors that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that needs to be improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can start on what we have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also grew cucumbers, different types of
cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have done some harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is good here is that we are not only
producing more, but we are producing
[SPEAKER_01]: safer, cleaner and fresher vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nutrient solution that were
discarded are not thrown to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that to fertilize our open food
crops like dragon fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our dragon fruit is so sweet because we
utilize the discarded fertilizer from our
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also grow swamp cabbage grown in
gravel culture using aquaponics systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also some research is conducted in
aquaponics systems for insulin plant
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our university is introducing this herbal
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told them that there is a safer way
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of this is to do that
aquaponically rather than planting in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also we constructed a vertical indoor
farming system there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fabricated this out of our locally
available materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew these tomatoes and other leafy
vegetables and herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also tried to grow strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when the COVID-19 pandemic happened,
the agricultural in the Philippines really
[SPEAKER_01]: suffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this pandemic has revealed the
fragility of our food systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lockdowns and checkpoints made food
distribution and delivery difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some time, maybe one month or some
weeks, our country was paralyzed because
[SPEAKER_01]: we do not know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of our countrymen suffered from
hunger and poverty because no one is
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to move our health and livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the economy was greatly
devastated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happened in the Philippines
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so much production in the
countryside that should be brought to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is no movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delivery is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why most of the produce are
just food, sometimes fed to livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of this, the Philippine
government somehow give assistance to our
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also those agencies,
private agencies and organizations who
[SPEAKER_01]: help the communities, which we call the
Bayanihan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this Bayanihan or cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a spirit that was relived during the
pandemic, which is all about the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, community boundaries and
donations from people, which somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: relive our problems during those times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the government intervention is
to produce more vegetables, produce more
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the new secretary came in,
the person of Dr. William Carr,
[SPEAKER_01]: he made this proposal, plant, plant,
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all about urban agriculture
because the urban areas was totally
[SPEAKER_01]: devastated during those times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it encouraged the Filipino to go back
to farming and to maximize the use and
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity of every land, resources and
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is encouraging us to have a new
thinking for agriculture and that is to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply modern technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, a house bill was approved that
talks about the Integrated Urban
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is all about the creation of the
urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads to the creation of the
center, which we call the Urban Farming
[SPEAKER_01]: Innovation and Learning Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was called to lead this program,
to lead the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have done a lot of campaign all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have this five point agenda just to
unify and harmonize the activities of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call the people to be involved in
food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of our setups that we are
introducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an aquaponics system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our favorite and we grow a lot of
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is just a small,
maybe this is just four by six square
[SPEAKER_01]: meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can scale this one according to the
financial capability of the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we try to involve the people,
the urban dwellers to be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those people that are living in
urban areas, we encourage them to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: and use all the spaces, even in their own
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people involved in tourism,
we help them so that all those who will
[SPEAKER_01]: have vacation in their area will not only
enjoy the scenery that they have there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but will also learn how to produce food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those people in the in the
academy, we try to introduce using their
[SPEAKER_01]: roof deck of their universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them introduced these crops in
the sky or crops in the rooftop like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing all the spaces in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is one of our participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have space in their area,
so we use the rooftop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the production is really very
improved, very much improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the neighborhood learned about
this one, they were all encouraged to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some of our projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only use PVC pipes because we do not
have that rectangular one, rectangular
[SPEAKER_01]: pipes that you have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so somehow we produce these different
types of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some of our clients try to duplicate
what we have there in our research area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put, he wants to try this
controlled environment using this
[SPEAKER_01]: fabricated chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Philippines actually need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why I told Dr. Manson that if
somehow we can have some collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: with our universities, because the target
now is the youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those people in the academy must call
those students to learn more about food
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it must be included in their
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we could have collaboration and
share what you have here in Cornell,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably it would be a great help to our
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in conclusion, urban farming,
actually, we have found out is a viable
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy of maintaining the food
requirements in urban and rural areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing modern agriculture like smart
and precision agriculture could enhance
[SPEAKER_01]: food production that would utilize the
limited resources like water, space and
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And policymakers should legislate laws to
involve the youth because they will be the
[SPEAKER_01]: one who will suffer if they do not in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Telling them that food security is not
only the concern of the government,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the professors, but it is our concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us is concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are encouraged to plant,
plant, plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a challenge, our secretary is always
telling this to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That no pandemic can bury our dreams and
aspirations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That no lockdowns can slow us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us turn challenges into
opportunities to survive and move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: towards a food secure and resilient
Philippines with prosperous farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: features.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were all encouraged and somehow
the people were have had no new thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: for agriculture because of this presence
before us sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from here, I would like to thank you
very much for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should just give you one.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a participation perspective,
how much participation are you seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: recently from the sort of growth in urban
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: The participation of our group,
sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the general population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how how quickly is this growing
and where is it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, before, when we introduced this
hydroponics and awaponics, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: telling that this is a stupid technology,
especially for a country like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines, wherein we are totally
agricultural country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But later, you know, just informing them
the importance of this and the relevance
[SPEAKER_01]: of the benefits of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, after 10 years, many have
participated, not only in the urban
[SPEAKER_01]: communities, but also in rural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would suggest from year one that we
started this, we are probably about six
[SPEAKER_01]: from one to ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are about on level six of of acceptance
and interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow with the program of
government, I think we have helped them in
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's not not a bunch of crazy
scientists anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're accepting of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it going from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, our government is pursuing
this urban agriculture and a house bill is
[SPEAKER_01]: approved in the lower house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the the Senate now is creating a
joint, a big camera committee on this
[SPEAKER_01]: talking on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and actually the first thing that they
are doing is to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Include this in the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is the youth that needs this to
be to learn distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be reaching down into
like elementary school, high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because from the elementary school,
the love of killing the soil or growing
[SPEAKER_01]: food like this must be taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as I was watching your talk and
thinking about the history of rice
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and biodiversity of rice
cultivars, I was wondering then as
[SPEAKER_03]: governments to industrialize the
agricultural system, are they going to
[SPEAKER_03]: save parts or implementing strategies to
retain that in the first place?
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like it's a very climate smart
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in the Philippines, the
International Rice Research Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a Philippine version of
that, which we call the Philippine Rice
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute on the field rights,
which try to improve our our varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before, let's say 20 years ago,
the average harvest of rice per hectare is
[SPEAKER_01]: only about seventy five kevans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about 50 kilograms in one sack
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, our farmers know because of the
influence of these two institutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they and the improvement of the varieties,
we are now growing about 200 kevans per
[SPEAKER_01]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, land area is reduced because
of, you know, as we grow population and
[SPEAKER_01]: also the urban because of the industries,
we are losing several hectares of land
[SPEAKER_01]: every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that increase in harvest because
of the improvement of rice varieties we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the only problem that we have
there is declining.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how good our production systems
here, we do not have full control of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow they are trying to improve the
varieties, having this resistance to weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to drought and submergence to
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: To come in on chat, let's take this one
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using this low technology, we have somehow
improved the production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are several studies on comparing
this in the traditional system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have improved the production because
you can do this everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the cities, I just don't know
whether I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the intervention of the city
government is really very great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're in the city, especially in
Metro Manila, they are employing this
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive that if there is a vacant lot in
an area, let's say in a subdivision,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can utilize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the owner of that lot will be exempted
to taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people in the community
utilize those techniques and the owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: those lands actually or those lots are
actually like that idea rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it very dirty and weeds will grow
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very not nice to look at,
especially in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question that came in on the
Zoom chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul writes, hello, thank you for sharing
your experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you please let me know how do you
split the cost of hydroponic equipment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you participate to pay for the
equipment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who manages the technical stuff such as
the nutrient solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you teach them how to manage
the crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the expenses involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Philippines, the investors are
really afraid to invest because we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the cost of establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we utilize everything that is
there in the locality, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you use different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock pool, the expanded clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to import that in the
Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use what is locally available like
gravel, like volcanic cinder, like lahar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of lahar in the Philippines
because of the Pinatubo eruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we are a rice producing
country, we utilize rice hull and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonized rice hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are also having this waste of
coconut, you know, from the coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of coconut wire and
coconut feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for the cost of establishment of
greenhouse, we try to simplify the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, but taking into consideration
the impact of typhoons that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, our design is good enough to
withstand the signal number three that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, about less than 200 kilometers per
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have there is we usually share
what we know, everything, just to help our
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the establishment of the
greenhouse on how to prepare the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: even to the growing, the maintenance of
the nutrient solution, we do that in
[SPEAKER_01]: seminars.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there are so many available
materials that was recorded by our
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Science and Technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: available online for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just click, say, LSU, Chito Sase,
find it in Google about hydroponic and
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there and it is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have some publications for some of
these technologies which are available
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is how we could help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have our team in Central Arizona
State University that when you request
[SPEAKER_01]: from our university president,
we can send even in the farthest place in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Philippines just to help extend what
we have known and share to them whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the beginning of your presentation,
you mentioned problems with corruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that affected your efforts at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds funny, but years ago,
we are about number three in Asia about
[SPEAKER_01]: corruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three years later, we are number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these people in those countries
tell that corruption in their country is
[SPEAKER_01]: always done under the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another country, oh, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corruption in our country happens on top
of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the Philippines, it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We include the table in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it would be corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we are just laughing at this,
but you know, corruption is everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably worse in our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if there's vegetables like
native to the Philippines or that the
[SPEAKER_02]: population uses that we're not maybe aware
of in the US, but you're finding like
[SPEAKER_02]: success growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do some research about that,
but introducing some of our that is how
[SPEAKER_01]: that is why some of our university,
my friends, they wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell, we really love to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need more knowledge how to
improve our systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: we usually do what we call tropical
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical means whatever the surroundings,
we will utilize that just to grow food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually discourage them to introduce
funds to cool them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have is only a motor and a
system we call passive system just to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not use any cooling systems and just
to limit the cost of energy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it, we tropicalize the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it is the process affected,
but somehow we can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, there is the presence,
the devastation of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inside the greenhouse, of course,
we will not spray, especially for short
[SPEAKER_03]: duration crops like lividate, suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to limit the investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, our structure, it is just made of
galvanized iron parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is fully welded and strongly
connected to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we do some grazing just not to
allow water during typhoons and heavy rain
[SPEAKER_01]: downfall to go inside and affect our
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the strong wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow we were we were successful in
doing those structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were good through category three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is about it is about 200
kilometers per hour, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know a coconut tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would bend to about 50 to 45 degrees
like that in signal number.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see a bamboo that would bend like
that signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we somehow managed to have those
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's hold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some questions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, to my host professor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also to Cornell and to all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
Thank you very much.
