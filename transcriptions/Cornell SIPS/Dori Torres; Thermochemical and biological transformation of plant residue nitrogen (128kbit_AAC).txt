[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Johannes mentioned, I've been here for
five years doing my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of the culmination of
those five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last five years, I've been
working in looking at biochar systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically at small cook sto systems in
Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically in this talk,
I'm going to be talking about what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to the carbon and nitrogen within those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a brief look at what
I've been doing, this is how typically a
[SPEAKER_00]: cook stove system or a household energy
system can look in Kenya, where I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working, where we have a traditional
stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of wood gathering from the
trees to combust in a three-stone fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is totally open air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot of greenhouse gases and
air pollutants that are constantly going
[SPEAKER_00]: and being emitted into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we were to introduce a biochar
cook stove, or I might actually call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolysis stove throughout the course of
the talk, this system might look totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main things of this system is
that we are now using biomass residues or
[SPEAKER_00]: plant residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are being used in this pyrolysis
stove, which I'll later go into explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still emits greenhouse gases and
air pollutants, but those are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this talk, I'm going to be looking
at nitrogen and carbon emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you would ask, well, where is this
feedstock coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the chapter I'm not talking
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the dynamics that I look
at, but I'm not going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'll be talking about the
biochar production with the stoves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then afterwards, once you have that
biochar, what happens to the biochar when
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually want to use it and put it
back into soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to be specifically
looking at is what happens to that
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in the plant residues that was
not emitted into the air but remained in
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do this, I actually have a series of
things that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start with the initial residue N,
and we pyrolyze these plant residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be looking at the gaseous
C and N losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thereafter, I took the biochar,
and I characterized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that there was a biochar
enrichment, and we want to look at how,
[SPEAKER_00]: why there was an N enrichment in the
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also look at different parts of the
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually fractionated the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extracted some components from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ended up with some volatiles,
or what we call volatiles, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: Italian extracted volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we remained with also the
extracted biochar, and we wanted to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how those look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, in an incubation experiment,
I look at the stability of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at what happens to the carbon in
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the nitrogen actually affect the
carbon stability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just again, a little bit of the three
things that I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The influence of small pyrolysis cook
stoves, systems on gaseous C and N
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, the characterization of the
organic nitrogen in biochar, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen's role on biochar stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving right along, let's look at what
happens when you have a system where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have introduced a biochar stove or a
pyrolysis stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, we have this
woman that I actually did some research
[SPEAKER_00]: with in Kenya, and she's using one of our
stoves to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are actually measuring the
emissions that are coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing to remember here is that
when you actually have the original
[SPEAKER_00]: system, the three-storm fire, there is
carbon and nitrogen oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, what happens is
that there's not enough oxygen in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process to combust fully the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is you have a lack of
stoichiometric air in complete combustion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have a lot of carbon monoxide
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the features of the system or of the
stove actually affect is the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, the mixing of the oxygen with the
gases, and also the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually affects those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in nitrogen oxidation,
those things also happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxygen mixing and temperature are part
of the variables that affect NO emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more specifically, we wanted to look
at what happens with the nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually is the effect of the
nitrogen in the biomass in the subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions that we're going to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we see from the stove?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this specific case, what we're
looking for is still the stoichiometry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the fuel and concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do we care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we even care to look at these
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from a climate change perspective,
we all know emissions are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They affect the greenhouse gases in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that more importantly,
there's actually an aspect to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is human health, which CO actually
leads to 3.5, or sorry, not CO,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor air pollution actually,
which includes CO, leads to 3.5 million
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths worldwide each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at the bigger
picture, that is why we're also trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how you can change the dynamics from
combustion emissions to maybe introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: a pyrolysis stove and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Africa in general has 20% global
emissions of CO and NOx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, more importantly, as wood stocks
actually diminish in a lot of these parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more people are using higher
nitrogen content plant residues for
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually has also some
implications in emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main objectives initially were to
measure the overall performance of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolysis cook stove and compare those to
the international standard organization
[SPEAKER_00]: cook stove parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to understand the mechanisms by
which CO and NO emissions are formed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pyrolysis stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, we designed a stove,
which I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, an engineer from India did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've taken this design on and in and
improved it from my master's on to my
[SPEAKER_00]: dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mechanical engineers have worked with
us for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you a little brief
explanation, inside here is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolysis chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the pyrolysis chamber right
over here, where you actually would put
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pyrolysis chamber is partially
sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does not actually have access to as
much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle over here,
we actually have a combustion chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you still have to feed some wood
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the combustion chamber actually is
what generates the initial heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: both for the cooking and also for the
pyrolysis of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as this biomass in the pyrolysis
chamber starts devolatilizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gases come into the combustion chamber
and are ignited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is you kind of switch over
into using more of the fuel from the
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles that are coming out from the
pyrolysis chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consequently, what happens is you have
both the wood and the volatiles or the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: from the pyrolysis forming part of the
flame that actually is generating heat for
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured these emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the performance of the stove in our
lab just so we could have a standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: way of comparing our stove to other stoves
that are potentially available to make
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hood that was designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought some students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the stove in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used two different types of biomass to
represent high and low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switchgrass pellets to be the high
nitrogen and hardwood pellets to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: low nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use pellets just to keep the
uniformity of the biomass and not
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce that as a variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a water boiling test, which is sort
of a traditional way of measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency or the performance of stoves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what you do is you boil
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you do is while you're boiling,
a specific amount of water, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually measuring emissions, temperature,
fuel use, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this stove operates a little bit
differently than your regular combustion
[SPEAKER_00]: stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to actually to modify the
original test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only difference is that generally
you extinguish the stove once the water
[SPEAKER_00]: boils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we just continue to change
the pots of water till the pyrolysis had
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like till all the fuel was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to measure real time
pyrolysis fuel loss and fuel consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say fuel consumption,
I'm referring to wood fuel consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were measuring with a real time
instantaneous gas emissions with a gas
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzer, Hariba 2PG 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right into the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to show you first is
what traditionally everybody shows you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's the pyrolysis stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wood pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The WP is wood pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are three metrics that are not
normally used to measure what happens with
[SPEAKER_00]: overall stove performance, specifically
this one has to do with sort of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's CO grams per megajoules of dry
fuel used.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO in grams per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rate of grams of amount of CO
emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually used as an indicator
for health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the modified combustion
efficiency, which is actually used to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether your stove is actually
combusting properly the gaseous products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a high combustion
efficiency, your stove is performing
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, here's the three stone
fire, the pyrolysis stove of our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are all similar stoves in
terms of what they claim to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them perform, these are more
gasifiers, but they do claim to make
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar and they do tend to operate in
similar fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tier ranking here is the
standards, the ISO standards that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, where basically they have set some
standards to see if your stove is
[SPEAKER_00]: performing properly or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being a poor performance and four
being the most optimum performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for each of these, there might be
individual rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually rank them individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tier one for CO, it's above 0.97.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 7 grams per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tier four is less than 0.42 grams per
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, fortunately enough,
our stove actually performs fairly well in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also, when compared to the three
stone fire, although it doesn't perform as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the stove tech telide,
which is actually the highest performing
[SPEAKER_00]: stove that is out there right now in terms
of emissions and that also can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that we're actually in a
range that is favorable for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as nitrogen, because I
said I was going to talk about nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: too, we want to look at the overall NO
emissions that we got from the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular case, there isn't a
lot of studies that actually look at
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen emissions or NO emissions from
stoves because they don't deem them as
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have anything to compare
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here what we wanted to show is that as
you have more nitrogen in the fuel,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in the x-axis, we have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the y-axis, we have NO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that as you have more
nitrogen, you have more NO evolution from
[SPEAKER_00]: the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was sort of a given to us that
that might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't satisfied with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't satisfied with those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you tell people, great, my stove
performs properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that actually mean for the
person that's using the stove?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean really in the context
of how things are evolving within the
[SPEAKER_00]: stove?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we looked at answering two more
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the key processes affecting the
formation of CO and NO emissions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolysis stove?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesized that there were the
rate of fuel consumption, wood
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, the rate of pyrolysis fuel
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they would all be positively
correlated with CO and NO emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher the nitrogen in plant
residues, it would lead to more NO
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we wanted to look is,
well, how does pyrolysis affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning of N?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought that most of it would
actually be going into the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show the results of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to actually look at the
dynamics of what's happening with the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, you actually need to look at
the instantaneous emissions, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really what's meaningful here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at over here in this chart
to the right-hand side, we have time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the x-axis and NO in grams per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rate of production of nitrogen
oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the higher the nitrogen
you have, the higher the NO you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of tells us the same thing,
that same picture as the prior graph that
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look at CO, which looks
so good in that table that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking, when you look at the peak levels
of CO in this graph, this is 3.62 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: per minute at the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here at the second highest,
maybe, or around there, or the second
[SPEAKER_00]: peak, it's 2.1 grams per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this means is that we're actually
quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dynamics of the CO evolving from the
stove is actually high, and that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: has implications for exposures to human
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are exposed to that level of
CO at one particular time, it actually can
[SPEAKER_00]: have consequences on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that we want to
look at in instantaneous emissions to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to remediate later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we wanted to also look at what
parameters of the stove or what parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chemistry that were happening
inside the stove actually predicted these
[SPEAKER_00]: two variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rate of production of CO and NO,
and what we actually found out is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of fuel consumption of the pyrolysis
fuel was actually predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing what was happening,
the two emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, overwhelmingly CO and NO of
pyrolysis rate was actually so fast that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't allow for proper mixing with
the oxygen and combustion of the CO,
[SPEAKER_00]: so then you have a lot of CO forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wood has some contribution to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at the nitrogen
emissions, instead of being only the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen content, it's actually the rate
at which the nitrogen is evolving through
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of pyrolysis that actually
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the temperature at which the
pyrolysis is happening is influencing the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate at which the nitrogen is coming out
of that stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really important because those
parameters are then later used to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and redesign or fix some things of the
stove that we would need to, so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: address these situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we wanted to see,
well, so we know that we have an O coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the stove, but we also want to know
what proportion of that nitrogen that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out is actually NO or other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three fuels that I
actually used, and I know that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: two before, but we had two of them that
were slightly different in nitrogen of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardwoods, so we separated those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we have fraction of the
total nitrogen that went actually into the
[SPEAKER_00]: stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so overwhelmingly, the majority of the
nitrogen actually remains in the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about 50% of it remains in the
char, and 10% of it is only NO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only issue is that we didn't measure
all the nitrogen species that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the other end species,
and that also accounts for about 40% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to know the overall and
nitrogen budget, we would have to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and measure those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this study, we were measuring NO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so moving forward, once we have this
nitrogen in the biochar, we want to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it remain there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do so, we actually decided to look
at the forms of nitrogen that were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in the original biomass in the
biochar and look at that nitrogen and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it was formed with different pyrolysis
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this using nitrogen K-EDGE next
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was gyroscopy, and there were some
interesting findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why did we also do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because, like I said, we found that a
lot of the nitrogen was remaining in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is all that nitrogen remaining?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the theories that we have is
that it's being incorporated into
[SPEAKER_00]: heterocyclic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have also said that
that could be true, but they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really been able to parcel out exactly
what kind of nitrogen and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of that nitrogen is with
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, like I said, what led us to
look at what type of dynamics was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with the nitrogen in the
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as temperature increases,
we have an enrichment of that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a tipping point.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 350 in this particular case,
we see that the amount of nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar is actually diminishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another interesting thing
here, and it's that when you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: low nitrogen, there is actually a much
steeper enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot larger enrichment in low
nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had high nitrogen containing
biomass, then there would be a few had
[SPEAKER_00]: high nitrogen containing the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually led to hypothesizing what
could be happening with the original
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we start with some very nicely,
easily aliphatic compounds of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we subject it to higher
temperatures, what we start seeing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are either condensation,
there is loss of water, there is formation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cyclic rings, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As carbon is lost, nitrogen gets more and
more aromatic or recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more the removal, well, it's also the
removal of water and CO, but oxygen being
[SPEAKER_00]: removed can lead to aromatic nitrogen or
triple bonds in nitrile, which are also
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to, given this,
we decided to look at the following
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to look at how does
pyrolysis temperature actually affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of nitrogen being formed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with increasing pyrolysis temperature
will lead more to more stable forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stable, I mean aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had another question, which is,
can the amount of nitrogen actually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass lead to more formation of
heterocycles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hypothesis being that increasing
amounts of nitrogen can lead to more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more aromatic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this study, I grew biomass at
different levels of nitrogen, so
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was the same except the
nitrogen that we were actually fertilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did woody biomass, crop residue,
and grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pyrolyzed them at three different
temperatures, 350, 500, and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned before, I did a
Soxhlet extraction with toluene to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the condensable volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to CLS, which was really cool,
and I totally geeked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the synchrotron over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is x-ray nitrogen per extrascopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you need to take away from this
through the rest of when I talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: data is that the energy level of the
absorbing atom actually decreases or
[SPEAKER_00]: increases depending on the atoms that are
adjacent to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's carbon, the energy level
decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's oxygen, the energy level
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be sort of the way that
I'm going to be explaining what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the many graphs that
I have of my data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are maize leaves, and these are
low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had the pair of each of these,
which is high nitrogen, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really see a difference in the squiggly
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're going to see here is all
the materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the plant residues, the biochar,
and the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first and foremost, I'm going to talk
about the plant residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so you know, I didn't just make
these up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually deconvoluted those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through a very rigorous process
of two years of deconvoluting my spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I have come out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you need to look at is that in
biomass, specifically, which we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at here, the majority of this biomass,
it's actually aromatic five-membered
[SPEAKER_00]: rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it has one or two nitrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was sort of surprising because
the majority of the people predict that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's amino acids, proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids and proteins have heterocyclic
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So us finding this actually is not that
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overwhelmingly, 50% of biomass is
actually five-membered rings, and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: due to some amino acids that are
constituents of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we look at the biochar,
what you're going to see is that there has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a shift of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the main peak in the biomass,
this 401.41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, there's nothing there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have a new peak at 398.84.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this peak actually corresponds to
highly aromatic six-membered rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not only do we have this new peak,
but as we move in increasing temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is happening here, we actually have
a shift to a lower energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more carbon surrounding that
nitrogen atom, those absorbing atoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was also very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but we identified a
nitrogen peak that wasn't explained in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are treating that guy as sort of a
little bit different because it hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been described before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tends to follow the trend with
biochar and pyrolysis temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, when we look at the
volatiles, which are these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are volatiles and increasing
temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are what we extracted from the
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that that 398 peak doesn't actually
exist there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we actually have this little peak
over here, which I didn't label,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's at 400.74, which is actually a
cyclic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cyclic nitrogen tends to be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very common as a byproduct of
pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the literature, it's been described as
a byproduct for breakdowns on volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually distinctive from the
biochar and from the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is allowed us to identify these
different components of the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, in this case,
cyclic is one of the forms of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overwhelmingly again, the aromatic
five ring is what actually predominates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bio-mats, in the volatiles,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that all mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanted to look at is who is
being affected or what is being affected
[SPEAKER_00]: with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the x-axis, I have
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the y-axis, I have two different
functional groups or what we are calling
[SPEAKER_00]: two different functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the aromatic six ring
nitrogen and that's percent of total.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that one nitrogen energy resonance
level that I told you that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all the other aromatic
six-membered rings that functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing is that with
increasing temperature, we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: an eightfold increase of that particular
nitrogen that we were looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: that six-membered ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the other case, what's happening is
that all the other six-membered rings are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually decreasing and they decrease by
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also looked at what happened with
the nitrogen level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately enough, we actually found
as well that as nitrogen contents
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, which is in the x-axis,
the total aromatic or the total
[SPEAKER_00]: heterocycles in the char actually
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually made sense because if
you have more nitrogen, then you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: can overcome that activation energy
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you satisfy the easier bonds and then
you proceed to make like a lot harder
[SPEAKER_00]: bonds or bonds that are more
energetically, that require more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, if you actually
have more nitrogen, then easier bonds or
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen bonded to aromatics, which are
nitrogen, which is out of a cyclic ring,
[SPEAKER_00]: then actually diminish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also makes sense because of the
same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually satisfy the amount of
nitrogen bonds that you can make and then
[SPEAKER_00]: thereafter, you cannot make anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually really interesting
because this is only described in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature once prior and it was a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really cool to see again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, finally, really quick,
why do we care about the form of nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that leads to the last part of my
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we hypothesize that if
you have more nitrogen, then maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen is actually, maybe that makes
biochar less stable, but is it really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all know that CN is used as a
measure for biomass decomposing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is it actually something that we can
use for biochar as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a metric that's useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hypothesis is that no,
that it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a useful metric to measure the
stability of biochar specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually looked at what is the
stability of the char look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it increase or decrease with
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, do any of these forms of
nitrogen that I just talked about actually
[SPEAKER_00]: are responsible for comparing some of the
stability to the biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, I did a mineralization study
with biochar only and sand only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two of the biochars and the plant
residues without charring and I incubated
[SPEAKER_00]: those at 30 degrees Celsius and I measured
respiration rates for CO2 and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a very, very long time, 200 days or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the resulting cumulative
mineralization was in the upper graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just the biomass and low nitrogen
and high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about low nitrogen,
think about 0.5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I talk about high nitrogen,
think about 2% or higher or 1.5% or
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the lower part, we have the
biochars at 350 low and high, at 700 low
[SPEAKER_00]: and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that
overwhelmingly, there is a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization of the carbon in the
biomass and a lot less in the biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are differences between the
biochars in terms of whether you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the total cumulative C
mineralization, of all these materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see is that while the
mineralization as the CN ratio increases,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually decreases for the biomass and it
is statistically significant, there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between the two biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is actually no meaning or it's
not as meaningful to use CN to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the stability of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what happened with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, nitrogen was immobilized during
the course of our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might have been led not only to
the fact that the nitrogen was in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different form, but we also weren't
providing any other sources of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nitrogen that was available was
immobilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the final part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final part was, well, what is
conferring stability to the char other
[SPEAKER_00]: than the carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: What role does nitrogen actually play in
the stability of biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fractionated the biochar,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually took the volatiles,
which we hypothesized would be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: easily mineralizable possibly,
form of nitrogen in the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took the functional groups of that
group and we correlated those against the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization of the biochar and saw if
there was any correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to predict using the
functional groups of the volatiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of the mineralization that occurred in
our biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three functional groups were
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three forms of nitrogen were
responsible or had something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the stability or mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have the highly aromatic
six-member rings, which was negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though this is an aromatic
structure, we are actually looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of this type of nitrogen,
so the single bonded nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it kind of makes sense that it
would be positively correlated and
[SPEAKER_00]: significant with mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, we just have a
nitrogen outside of a cycle, which if we
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesize, well, am I going to go for
the easy thing or the difficult thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: chew on, a microbe might actually go for
the easier thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also makes sense that it would have
been the nitrogen outside of the ring that
[SPEAKER_00]: had a positive correlation with
mineralization of the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put this all together,
what does that all mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, when we look at biochar,
when we look at biochars, we can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: look at biochar by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at a part as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to look at what happens when
you're making biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, figuring out what the
parameters that are affecting the gaseous
[SPEAKER_00]: emission dynamics, it's really important
because then that allows us to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the drawing board and improve in designs
that are ultimately being used by women in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, they are being used in some
households.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really big deal that we need
to pay attention that, sure, we're really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really interested in reducing CO and NO
and retention of nitrogen in the biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: for maybe climate impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also very interested in doing
that to reduce impact on human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes down to what you do now
with the biochar that you have or what
[SPEAKER_00]: these farmers do with the biochar that
they have, it's really important to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens to that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a farmer that is going
to take a high nitrogen-containing residue
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn it into biochar, is that really
worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is locking that nitrogen into these highly
aromatic structures worth it for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the kind of things that
we need to be thinking about when we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually think about making biochar,
when we actually think about introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: stoves that are going to make biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the overall implications to the
people in the system, to the users in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that it changes in the type
of nitrogen and stabilizes the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also want to know, what are the
implications for farmers along the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that are actually using these materials?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
