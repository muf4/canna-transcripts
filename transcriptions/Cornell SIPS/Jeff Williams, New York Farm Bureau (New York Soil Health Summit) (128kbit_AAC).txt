[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are late for lunch, so I will make this
brief, but hopefully challenging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Farm Bureau is an advocacy
organization who spent a lot of time here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Capitol lobbying legislators and
staff on a whole host of agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, including soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people we actually lobby are back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank the people from the
Senate Assembly staff for being here to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend this much time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real real testament to their
dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people here are from south of
Westchester County?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this whole soil health equals farm
profitability equation nailed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to almost the greatest extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of legislative partners from
upstate New York who help with incentives
[SPEAKER_00]: to pass incentives legislation for soil
carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people from upstate New York
championing environmental protection fund
[SPEAKER_00]: and AEM program, non-point program,
climate resilient farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 20 million people in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the 40% upstate people with
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole other 60% Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the five boroughs of Manhattan,
who don't really honestly care about soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are in the sweet spot, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a lot of borrow a phrase
from one of the earlier slides,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cussing and fussing about
agriculture here in Albany and even within
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry, whether it's GMO versus
conventional, whether it's pesticide use,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor issues, big versus small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue is not one of those cussing and
fussing issues because we can tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: story to farm legislative districts about
farm profitability that comes from soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more importantly, we can start
talking to urban legislators about climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and the mitigation impacts that
soil health has.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about much more, frankly,
about climate change than soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our mission, our goal is to tell that
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a lot of farmer to farmer
stuff and that's really needed because we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to extend this knowledge base across
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't ignore the work that's done
here because this conference wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened without state funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave's programs, the research wouldn't
happen without state funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPF funding for AEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Hooker talking about extending
technical knowledge and technical advice
[SPEAKER_00]: on soil health in the AEM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't happen without state funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support funding in legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess my challenge in the short
time I have today is to say, let this not
[SPEAKER_00]: be the only time that you come to Albany
to talk about soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue this drumbeat
throughout legislative session,
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year with legislators and
staff, because there's so many issues out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are outside of agriculture that
they're hit with every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be one of those issues as
well or else they'll forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this issue is far, far too important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far, far has far too many powerful legs to
have that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the challenge and now it's time
for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
