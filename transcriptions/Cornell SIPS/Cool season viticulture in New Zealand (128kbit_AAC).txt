[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to have folks here to hear and be
joined if you're not aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gere Award is a wonderful award that
our section allows students to work and
[SPEAKER_02]: study abroad for at least a half year or
sometimes a year, sometimes a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great award.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay started her travels in December of
2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was one of the winners of a degree in
2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: She came back in June of 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: She finished her master's here and now is
going to be the section of viticulturists
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merced and Mariposa counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very excited for her opportunity to
study here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's here to give us a talk about the
Gere and her experiences in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Nina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is me paying up one of the
conditions of the Gere Award is to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: talk once you've been back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the timing of my employment
after my master's, I kind of had to high
[SPEAKER_00]: tail it in August when there weren't
students around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thankful for the opportunity to
come back here at this time of year and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to you all about what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be the first of many Lord of
the Rings references.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brace yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is my story of there and back
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Gere Award tale by Lindsay Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've wanted to go to New Zealand since
I've virtually can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father went when he was around 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with a rotary exchange kind of
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went and stayed in Rotorua with a New
Zealand family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grew up hearing tales of how
awesome New Zealand was and always wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also grew up loving penguins and found
out the home of little blue fairy penguins
[SPEAKER_00]: or little blue penguins is New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I could pretty much walk,
I wanted to go see penguins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, to say I was slightly obsessed
with Lord of the Rings when I was in high
[SPEAKER_00]: school is an understatement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw each film eight times in theaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that New Zealand is the home of
Lord of the Rings, I had wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I desperately wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when I was around 18,
19, when I graduated high school,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought, oh, instead of going to do
the European backpack thing, I'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: through New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drive around and see all the sights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dead set on doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my parents sort of look at me kind of
concerned more for the nerdiness than my
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, though, you can't rent a
car until you're 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was 19, and I said, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go to New Zealand when I am 25 and
drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize how perfect that life
plan was going to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to get into one of the
industries where New Zealand is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New Zealand wine industry is quite
famous for its sauvignon blanc production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many other smaller regions that
are emerging for their cooler climate
[SPEAKER_00]: style, pinot noir, and other varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite known in the world of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I happened to be fortunate enough to
have this desire and passion to go to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand and the career to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I had to choose a location for the
Gere Award, I was sort of flopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping around the idea of Australia
versus New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I'd be gone about six months,
which isn't quite enough time to do two
[SPEAKER_00]: countries justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought this was going to be
the time to pursue my dream of going to
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloudy Bay is probably one of the most
famous labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Zealand, they're famous for their
sauvignon blanc in the Marlborough region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing this exact label
presented on a screen, much like this in
[SPEAKER_00]: my intro to wines class at Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, had that thought of,
well, I should go there one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you an idea, there are several
wine regions in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll hear me talk about a lot of
them over the course of my travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tiny concentrated area in the
north part of the North Island near
[SPEAKER_00]: Auckland and in Waiheke Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of premium, very small production
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of other bigger, more famous
regions are the Hawke's Bay region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the cities of Napier and
Hastings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really developing quite a
reputation for their Syrah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Blenheim, the city which is in
the Marlborough region, which is the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: of where the wine you've probably heard of
comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the king of sauvignon blanc in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have wines grown in the
Canterbury region around Christchurch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also quite a reputation for
Pinot developing down near the Queenstown
[SPEAKER_00]: Otago Peninsula region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear me mention these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to know that New Zealand
has several distinct wine growing regions
[SPEAKER_00]: with different varietals, kind of in
different popularity in each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've quite enjoyed New Zealand wines ever
since I kind of went down this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really awesome experience to
get to explore all these regions on my
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of traveled the Kiwi Way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I booked a ticket and said I'll figure it
out when I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I landed in Auckland, and that's where
my journey kind of started.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first day, I bought a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out you don't actually need to rent
a car in New Zealand if you're there for
[SPEAKER_00]: over a couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very large secondhand car market
from Asia that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually much more common for if
you're there for any significant amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to just buy kind of a clunker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably hadn't slept in 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said let's go buy a vehicle because
that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taught by a really wonderful little
Maori man how to drive on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the road too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taken up and around Auckland,
given a view of the city, all while trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to not be paralyzed in fear of driving on
the other side of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a recurring theme of this
presentation is penguins.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all costs, I saw penguins every single
time I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Kelly Tarleton Aquarium in
Auckland, and I got to see some king
[SPEAKER_00]: penguins there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also took part of a haiti,
which is a very classic New Zealand thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of you saw a Chinese
presentation, but it's kind of the English
[SPEAKER_00]: influence on New Zealand culture,
haiti, especially in Auckland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quite enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to play the tourist a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then made my way up to Whangarei,
W-H is pronounced F as I discovered in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand, up to what's called the
Northland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area is a little more, I don't want
to call it tropical, but subtropical kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of climate, quite warm and humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ocean Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I spent my New Year's Eve
welcoming in 2014, a day earlier than all
[SPEAKER_00]: of you here because of the time change.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is this is one of many,
many, many beautiful pictures of New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an awesome experience to get to
celebrate the change of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rode on the team at Davis all four years
of my undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where else in New Zealand could I say
that I went swimming with a horse?
[SPEAKER_00]: We went down, we changed into swimsuits,
went down into that water, the Pacific,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see right there, then had a picnic
lunch with Savion Blanc out on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can say is I had some fun on this
trip as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Whangarei Falls, lots and lots
of waterfalls throughout New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a, you know, picturesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tourist goes to see Whangarei Falls
in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a horticultural note, this is also the
region where I made out a hike to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: cowrie tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowrie trees grow incredibly tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any branches kind of
below, anywhere below the very crown of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow to be incredibly old.
[SPEAKER_00]: These old growth trees are kind of a sight
to behold in their height and their age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very well protected in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they have a very shallow
rooting system, they actually often build
[SPEAKER_00]: little boardwalk planks to go around the
tree so you can go up to them without
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're damaging the fragile root system
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was fortunate enough to go out on a
few hikes kind of out in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Zealand, it's very frequent to have
trails go through farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of look, you're tromping in
the middle of a, you know, sheep pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're looking for the next trail
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I followed a couple of those to go see
cowrie trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, I stopped at my very first
winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northland, while not a super famous
region for wine these days, is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first regions planted in New Zealand,
probably due to its proximity to Auckland
[SPEAKER_00]: and early English settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Longview Wines, it was kind of fun at
the tasting room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out the winemaker's son had
actually gone to the Eastern Institute of
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology, or EIT, who I was going to be
helping out on a research project with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realizing the kind of influence of EIT
graduates throughout the country was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fun very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very nice Chardonnay that I
enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kerikeri is where I swim with the
horses, a little more north of Whangarei.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made my way back down to kind of the first
true wine region I visited in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Waiheke Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a destination,
getaway from Auckland tourist spot these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very desirable white sand beaches,
but also has quite a large viticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a little ferry over from
Auckland, get a great view of the city on
[SPEAKER_00]: your way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this vineyard in particular,
I'd like to make note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Jurassic Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy has a degree in geology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hires a few viticultural consultants as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wines are spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a really amazing Molta Puccino and
some of those other Italian wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmer climate reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This island gets a lot warmer,
but has a lot of wind coming off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean and has humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a very interesting climate
to be growing some grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some pretty spectacular
wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, it's a huge tourist
destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the view from Cable Bay Vineyards,
which is famous for having a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: luncheon that I did partake in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, big white sand beaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coolest part about the way I did this
is there was a pass you got with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ferry, which is you paid, you hopped on
the ferry, and there was a little vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: bus that took you on a little loop of all
the different wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the math, and I could have hit
about five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit all five that I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's actually plenty more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a day trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an overnight trip for a lot of
Aucklanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's sort of this tourism that
drives, I think, the local wine commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a beautiful location,
is all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some very interesting wines grown
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after making my way back down from
Waiheke Island, I made a stop in Hobbiton
[SPEAKER_00]: before heading down to the centre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hobbiton, this was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually happened twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that basically who are grad
students are hobbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow things, and we like drinking beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, it was like re-commuting with
my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool about Hobbiton that I should
note is they actually have full year-round
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually garden the location,
the little farmlands they have and plots
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in season with the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a compost pile right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually do make an effort to
maintain it looking like it was an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: little agricultural farming community
among hobbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's actually doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Paid gardeners from the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a paid tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site is actually owned by a sheep
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own quite a large number ahead of
sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all surrounding sheep farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then New Line Cinema agreed to leave
the hobbit holes behind when they left.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they made Lord of the Rings,
they actually stripped out most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could kind of see like circles of
hobbit hole doors in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they did the hobbit, they rebuilt
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the owners of the farm said,
please leave everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were already running tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was actually like 1,000 times
better than just having some plywood
[SPEAKER_00]: doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, that's Bag End from the
movie, if any of you recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to make a note in the lower
quarter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a chicory plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicory was one of my undervine cover
crops I grew here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like your work follows you no
matter where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was sort of an
interesting note.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has beautiful purple flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I then had made my way down to the
center of the country where I'm traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a particularly avid hiker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to climb Mount Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mount Narahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the Tungeriro State Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really, really famous day hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a 10 hour day hike called the
Tungeriro Alpine Crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sub route you can decide to take
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I really cared about doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people have a bus drop them off at
the beginning of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hike this whole crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it picked up the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hike up Narahoe or Mount Doom
and hike back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they describe the Tungeriro crossing as
difficult, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, there's a lot of hiking
and stairs and mountain climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You climb up some good elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got some good miles under you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They describe the subtrail climbing up
Narahoe as also difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like comparing community college
art class to Cornell engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are different levels of difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a picture I would have turned
to my left to take when I was climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more rock climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arms hurt the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, being the worry ward I am,
packed my bag with the 20 pounds of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: rain gear and water and snacks just in
case all this stuff happens that they warn
[SPEAKER_00]: you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm alone climbing up a four hour hike
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably never prouder of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a ring to throw in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, I called it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, so that's the
descent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like skiing than it is hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those, like, I had to do
before I die things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Narahoe up to three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably true if you were unfit and
carrying 20 pounds of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no actual trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of can see those white lines
are sort of the rough guidelines that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make to make your way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very glad to say I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never need to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see Tongariro National Park is
the southern region below the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Lake Taupo, that large
lake right in the center of the North
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Taupo is a cute little town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, kind of cross the
mountains over to the Hawke's Bay region
[SPEAKER_00]: to Napier and the kind of more culturally
important town of Hastings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very, very fortunate to have a
connection from my Davis days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mark Krasnow worked in the lab of Mark
Matthews when I was an undergrad doing
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I vaguely knew he was in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of reached out to him around
the time of the Juror Award that I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey, I'm going to be in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to help out with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're currently
researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were doing some cluster
thinning research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, hey, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we stopped the cluster thinning
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing a lot of work on right
now is undervine management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatments for sustainable practices,
which is basically the basis of what my
[SPEAKER_00]: thesis was here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, well, that was convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agreed to help out on the project
that had, there's two sites of this
[SPEAKER_00]: project, one in the Hawke's Bay and one in
the Marlboro region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to be helping out at the
sister site in Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was going to be based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I obviously stopped up at Hawke's Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Krasnow has since left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's now teaching actually a kind of
wine and integrated viticulture course for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Culinary Institute down in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his successor, Dr. Carmo, you can see
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the one in the blue shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's taken over the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was very amazingly welcoming on
the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one of her students,
Ashley, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were working on a slightly different
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went out in the field with them for
a couple days and helped take data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool piece of data that
they're doing in that upper right-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: corner right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to doing the rather
time-consuming EPQA that Justine's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan of and that I know I've taken a
ton of, there's researchers in Spain that
[SPEAKER_00]: have developed a rough software program
that basically, if you put a whiteboard
[SPEAKER_00]: with good enough light, so there's not too
many shadows, that's always the trick is
[SPEAKER_00]: catching the right light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds are your friend for this piece of
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a whiteboard up and put this frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a program that will roughly
count the number of green pixels to white
[SPEAKER_00]: pixels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New Zealand especially,
looking at the number of percent gaps in a
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy caused by a treatment is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking to see if something super,
super devigorating these vines or these
[SPEAKER_00]: vines taking a punch by having vegetation
underneath or actually in the projects I
[SPEAKER_00]: was helping out with in Hawke's Bay for a
couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very interesting project because
water is included in your taxes in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers have the luxury of being able to
basically water when and what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there hasn't been a whole lot of actual
water stress measurements and correlations
[SPEAKER_00]: to their soil moisture meters,
like say in California where water is very
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictive, we know a lot more on that
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these projects was literally
looking at commercial vineyard sites that
[SPEAKER_00]: had soil moisture probes and correlating
them to the pre-dawn and mid-day stem
[SPEAKER_00]: water potentials of the vine so that these
growers have a better tool of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what these soil moisture
reads are actually relating to in their
[SPEAKER_00]: vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it sort of was like, oh,
it reached this level, sure, I should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we went around to
multiple commercial vineyards where this
[SPEAKER_00]: project was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bottom right-hand corner,
that's actually the student vineyard on
[SPEAKER_00]: the EIT campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make note, it's actually
just been mowed, but at the bottom in that
[SPEAKER_00]: inner row cover crop is actually chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a student, a former student
named Steve Wheeler who'd hit his master's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at using chicory in inter-rows of
vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have referenced his paper I don't
even know how many times in my own work
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at chicory in under vine rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually fortunate enough to
meet him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people at EIT connected me with him
and I got to meet him and talk with him
[SPEAKER_00]: about his work and what he's doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a very kind of fun academia
circle moment to close the gap,
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the man whose paper I referenced
at least a dozen times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, chicory actually is
used not, it wasn't everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I certainly did see it being
intentionally used as an inter-row cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sister site of the site I would be
working on the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically there were three different under
vine treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me out at Elephant Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actually two sites,
two commercial vineyards in both Merlot
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sarah in the Hawke's Bay, which are
kind of the important varietals for those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here there's this awesome
signage that would explain when treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: started and stopped because in New Zealand
it's very, very common to hire individual
[SPEAKER_00]: contractors to do most of your vineyard
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need a sprite, I'll hire my sprite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a spray contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I need cultivation under the vine or
herbicide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'll hire that contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of this sort of piecemeal
labor work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, they were hiring contractors
to do their maintenance under vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sort of very nice labeling out
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually the Elephant Hill sites
are really famous and beautiful winery in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hawke's Bay region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fun to get to see a
research project out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a note, you can see the sign on
the right here that's this little logo
[SPEAKER_00]: about New Zealand sustainable wine
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To enter any wine competition in New
Zealand, you must have the certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of push to maintain these
sort of internal sustainability standards
[SPEAKER_00]: and meet this labeling kind of regulation,
if you want to call it, because it lets
[SPEAKER_00]: you enter wine competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a really cool
movement to see within New Zealand and see
[SPEAKER_00]: it widespread in New Zealand since I think
sustainable labeling, shifting to meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: the needs for a specific region and
climate is a really important thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a cool thing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of note, all the shooting signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds are a huge problem in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds are a huge problem in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place I've seen them worse is
Long Island, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they literally put someone with blanks
and normally a pump action on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: an ATV or truck and drive around different
blocks shooting because it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best bird scare tactics they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they actually say shooting,
they're not just talking bird cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually mean someone in the back of
a truck shooting a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always sort of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would use real shells, they said,
and take the birds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're worried about the lead content
in the vineyard because birds are a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you can see I'm there early
enough in the season that these aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: netted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the raisin, so when the berries
start to soften and accumulate sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn color, in the case of the red
varieties, as soon as they hit the raisin,
[SPEAKER_00]: those nets have to go up because otherwise
it's going to just be a nice little lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the women who wonderfully
hosted me and showed me around while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: at EIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's moving from left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ting Ting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Dr. Carmo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashley, her student myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Petra King.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt very, very fortunate to have these
amazing women show me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was sort of an amazing roundtable
dinner on my last night in town where we
[SPEAKER_00]: realized it was five women of viticulture
all at one table, all from around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, which was sort of interesting and
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very, very grateful for the
opportunity and experience they gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much I was able to learn about the
region and New Zealand wine growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: them, as well as they welcomed me on
helping them out on a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very, very thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to take that moment to give a
shout out to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also apparently got into the mountain
climbing mode while I was in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is so funny if you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I decided to climb Tamata Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tamata Peak is this sort of mountain in
the middle of the Hawke's Bay region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's me having ascended the peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petra, who I was staying with,
had some friends who kind of do this walk
[SPEAKER_00]: every Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, sure, I'll come, a walk up a
mountain hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ended up breaking off with one of
the men of the group who I didn't know it
[SPEAKER_00]: but had formerly been like a professional
like race walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so took me up these switchback hills
where I thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wonderfully took the photo for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see sort of the beauty of this
vineyard and agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of apple production in this
region, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stone fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the Hawke's Bay and the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a stunning region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I highly recommend going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some fantastic sarahs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend the bullnose sarah,
which also happened to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research sites for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making my way south finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little detour into Martinboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little tiny bit of a cultural
area outside of Wellington, the capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martinboro was actually having its summer
reesling event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of funny that I traveled
halfway around the world to have a summer
[SPEAKER_00]: of reesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very small production, very boutique
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some really cool things going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some completely organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of figuring their style out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a fun little stop on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Wellington is quite famous for it
has this massive garden that you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: take a cable car up to, this very steep
hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you go to the university
there, you take this cable car basically
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to campus every day, which I think
is kind of awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the hydrangeas in full
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking through and happened to hit
an outdoor music concert that they
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently do in the summer every weekend
for most of the afternoon in the beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, sure, I'll sit down for a free
outdoor concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my little experience in
Wellington.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really kind of awesome and
amazing to see such an amazing public
[SPEAKER_00]: garden there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get now, that was sort of my North
Island experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to head on south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take the ferry to get from the
north to south island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually kind of a beautiful ride
if you hit it during the day because you
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the Mulborough Sounds,
which is this sort of island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this like peninsula-y,
island-y part of the north part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: south island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely stunning ride in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to make a note, pretty much
anything you're getting in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will have been brought into
Auckland, if it's in the south island,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's come on one of these ferries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the wine that's made in the south
island, all the Mulborough Sauv Blanc is
[SPEAKER_00]: being put onto trucks, normally not in a
bottle form, normally in a tanker form,
[SPEAKER_00]: being tankered across the ferry,
then driven up to Auckland where it's then
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your food, all your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sort of puts in perspective the
enormous cost of living in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was sort of interesting to see that
half the time on the ferry, you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: battling cargo space and cargo room with
trucks as well as just passengers like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a very different ferry
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is apparently one of the
roughest patches of sea that ferries
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will cancel the ferries if it gets
too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only have a slow ferry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a fast ferry anymore,
in part because of the potentially rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both times were pretty smooth sailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is, I certainly have heard,
not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a quick detour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look on the part of the south
island, there's the city of Nelson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went more west than north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that, you'd see what is Able Tasman
Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told, when asking everyone I know
who had been to New Zealand, what do I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says, hands down, Able Tasman
Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, first breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh yeah, you can do these other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone says Able Tasman Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will give everyone in this room the
same advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to New Zealand, do anything but
go to Able Tasman Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most stunning thing
you'll see in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a whole hike along the whole
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do that because I did not have
the equipment or the time because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sneaking this in before I started
my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did do a couple day trips where they
have little boats that go down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: various little landings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uninhabited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a state park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's quite frequented by these boats
and ferries that take people there every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture of that rock, it's split apple
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big Maori.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maori are the native peoples of New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Maori legend about the
axe of the Maori warrior that carved that
[SPEAKER_00]: rock in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can kayak around that if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly just hung out on the beach and
hiked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stunning beach and forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can say is go to New Zealand,
go to Able Tasman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally made it down to Mulborough,
the wine region that I was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: calling home for the majority of my trip
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have heard, if you've heard of
a wine from New Zealand, I can almost
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee you it's going to be a
Mulborough style Sauv Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I should say, I misspoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say it's a Mulborough Sauv Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mulborough style Sauv Blanc is now a
recognized style.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Zealand, this often means more
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And herbaceous, you get fresh cut grass,
bell pepper, but also a lot of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of passion fruit off of a lot
of the more better done Mulborough Sauv
[SPEAKER_00]: Blancs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bright citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this big in your face grassy green
fruity wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decent levels of acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a coolerish climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here there's a lot of growers,
a lot of growers that aren't attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an interesting dynamic that
I'll try to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of contract wineries,
meaning you're a big winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your space, your tanks and your labor
is sort of up for bid by someone who wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contract out their wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make wine out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the vast majority of labels
you're going to see in the market don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a tasting room winery available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's very little crossover of
those kind of wineries because New Zealand
[SPEAKER_00]: is largely an export market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of their wine is being taken out of
their country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's meant for our shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy export to United States,
Sweden, Canada, Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's who they're marketing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're exporting your wine anyway,
you might as well pay someone who has the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities to make your label and get it
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of this still contract
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a wine grape grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sell my grapes to someone looking to
buy wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 168 wineries in the region with over
56,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauvian Blanc is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's over 85% of what's
planted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauvian Blanc is the region where the
demand is and what the region is known
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I think Pinot Noir grows
very well there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Pinot is starting to develop
quite the reputation in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to get in early,
you'd see the other varietals on there
[SPEAKER_00]: that make a bit of an appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chardonnay, Pinot Green, Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a smattering of other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Weigelt from one of the wineries
there, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a kind of a funny mix of stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sauv, or as they call it Savvy,
is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see is the bulk of the acreage
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of a little cutesy map you
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely lived on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the town of Blenheim,
kind of right around here, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived and kind of where the actual city
part is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this valley encompassed
by two mountain ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Mulrow Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is they sort of
subdivide it into three little regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are pretty cool regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not reaching the hot
temperatures of Australia or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say they're warmer than maybe our
summers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at what is considered a
cool climate viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons I was attracted to
going to New Zealand as well is after
[SPEAKER_00]: having gotten grape experience in both
California and New York, I was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for someone a little bit more in
between, someone a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling upon some of my cool climate
experience in New York, I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the situation in New Zealand a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, all of these are dry
compared to, say, the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do get in season rainfall,
however.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are going to be wetter than
California or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at a comparatively dry
climate to, say, like the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I happened to be there
during one of the wettest falls on record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I brought it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you a bit of background,
at least in the Northeast, you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: bud break around May.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, it's normally the first
week of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of go through raising
that ripenings happening August or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting, September, October,
and those vines are going dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dropping leaves in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything switched a little bit in the
southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stuff's starting to happen more
like September.
[SPEAKER_00]: I arrived, remember, in December,
January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I was popping around
helping out with that EIT research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those berries were just starting to go
through veraison a little bit after I got
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't quite line up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like February, January that
veraison was occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then harvest is starting, depending on
the varietal, late February in an early
[SPEAKER_00]: year, mid-February, but most likely early
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're normally got everything
off the vine by May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sort of a little cycle there
that was kind of fun to see and very
[SPEAKER_00]: disorienting when you have three summers
in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very interesting and cool institute
that New Zealand has is Plant Food
[SPEAKER_00]: Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have facilities up in Auckland,
but they also have a Mablenum Station,
[SPEAKER_00]: which predominantly, and makes sense,
focuses a lot on grape and wine research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little research winery,
which they did a lot of little
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really cool to see that
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some cool stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped out with research for a couple
days to sort of see what was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Damian Martin showed me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sort of the director there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was awesome to meet him and have
him introduce me to all the research
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the one connected me to helping
out and kind of following everyone around
[SPEAKER_00]: for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that upper right-hand corner,
you can see that kind of computer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like a, I don't even know,
shell scanning thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best piece of technology I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw berries at the bottom,
and it counts the berries and gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: size of berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more hand-counting berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very cool for comparing
treatments to see if it had an effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: berry sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom left-hand corner,
there was a research scientist there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Deon Mundy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at a lot of potential kind
of paints, as we call them, for treating
[SPEAKER_00]: wood against fungal infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: In dormancies and prunings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all his grown-up little
samples to see which funguses were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the presence of these different
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the lab of Dr. Mike Trott
that I was helping doing that berry
[SPEAKER_00]: sorting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me around, kind of took me under
his wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really, really thankful for all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He even invited me to a traditional Kiwi
barbecue where I met Dr. Richard Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he showed me a couple of his trials
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That potted one had to do with nitrogen
fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was doing another project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That related leaf removal and girdling
different shoots and seeing nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: transport differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he showed me a couple of the research
vineyards that they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really, really thankful to get an
idea of the research going on in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand, in Marlborough, in prime wine
country with plant food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trial that I was actually going
there to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, we were the sister site to
these trials that were occurring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawkeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were looking at three different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at mowing under the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaving whatever plants wanted to grow
there naturally and just mowing them with
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial mower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at cultivating underneath the
vines the traditional organic method of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control in a vineyard underneath the
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at herbicide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the exact same experimental
designs as in Hawkeye Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at Sauvignon Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: These projects are kind of in the middle
of this bigger block highlighted in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the top varietals then for the
Marlborough region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we'd look at them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped out with at least some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Chris Williams was sort of the,
I'll call him undergraduate, although he's
[SPEAKER_00]: older than me, helping out on the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came along and kind of helped
him out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you pick and sort out
all those leaves, cut off the petioles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then feed them through the scanner,
which gives you the leaf areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up being a very interesting
piece of data looking at how those were
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by those under vine treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took timeline photos of the vineyard to
look at the establishment and the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: growth back after you cultivated something
or after you had applied herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did typical petiole nutrient analysis,
see how that's affecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did those canopy photos that I had
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at percent shaded area
underneath the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of another correlation to canopy
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have lots of big canopy,
you're creating more shade on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did normal maturity sampling,
lots of maturity sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week, just about every other week,
we were sampling from each experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 berries and looking at all the
traditional sugar and acid levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at nutrient levels used to
simulable nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also collected samples at both
veraison, that ripening period,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at harvest time before we used gross
gas chromatography to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: methoxypyrazines and the savian lump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did phenolic analysis on the pinot
to help see if this chemistry is being
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most magic machine that I grew
to use a lot in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the wine scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it will do all those hard work
measuring those bricks, TA, pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a little cup sample this big in
it, press button, she's got all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a quarter measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you have to calibrate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calibrating is a big thing with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foss makes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't cheap pieces of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new one that will also do sulfurs runs
$200 plus, $1,000, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for large scale production wineries
and for research purposes, I cannot stress
[SPEAKER_00]: how awesome they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Food has one, and some of the bigger
wineries in New Zealand have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing for being able to process
that much data and be able to look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there, that's a site from
the pinot research site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down there, the pinot is being naturally
less vigorous than the savian blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some fun comparisons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that data is, well, it's probably
been processed now, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily looked at it and gotten up to
date on all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the, what was it, the second year
of the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going on for a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of interesting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of similar to mine in that it's
looking at, there might be some nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at lower nitrogen levels
when you have stuff growing underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: vine compared to when you don't have stuff
growing beneath the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe some de-vigoration that's coming
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see the
conclusions of this site after three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, especially given the parallels to
my own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fun to go see a different
way of doing kind of the same idea and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some new ideas and perspective on the
research that's been near and dear to me
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the de-vigor problem wasn't even so much
what they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more the sustainable slant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more worried about, they don't
want to really de-vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are very, very nervous about that
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea of being able to say you
don't use herbicide or don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate is really desirable there
because of that sustainable kind of focus,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sustainable wine growing focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's more where the drive of this
project comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Pino, that might be a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I happened to be there during a
year of record yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Dr. Mike Trott has a model that
predicts yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminds me of some of Alan's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his model predicted something like 80%
above normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, that can't be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given the incredible high yield of this
year, it wasn't such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in future years, that would be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these growers are not looking to
reduce yield whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they really do want to eliminate
herbicide or cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, mowing is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowing is cheap and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them, that would be a huge
advantage compared to having to hire a
[SPEAKER_00]: contractor to come out and cultivate or
apply herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's more the slant that they're
going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're wondering, can they get away
with it without seeing huge depreciations
[SPEAKER_00]: to yields or affecting wine chemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never heard anyone express it in
that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually think they're necessarily
talking about it in those terms is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way I can say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, it's more they don't like
percent gaps in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's considered wasted space
that could have been fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the Sauvignon Blanc is being
grown like three canes in a two-tiered
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of it's already plenty shaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that they don't want that
reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's a gap in the canopy,
then that could have been a chute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have been a cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have been fruit that was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think especially when you have a
grower contract-based industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw the number of growers to wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these growers are making their money
by having some decent yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that kind of counterpoint to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different perspective than my
research where it's like, please,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we do anything to slow these vines
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said for them, too,
it does have seasonal rainfall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing like where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to irrigate to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will up the irrigation as they
feel nervous to get more growth and get
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of methoxypyrosines and shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least from what I can see,
the Marlboro style is terroir,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also terroir in the sense that water
is included in your taxes and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's not necessarily their
huge concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what I gleaned from my
perspective of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely more of a yield loss
potential income concern that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: than maintaining a wine style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the wine style is going to be
there even if you did have some reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research site I was just describing
was in fact owned by Pernod Ricard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably use these interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pernod Ricard is the giant corporation
that owns this label called Brancotta
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a winery in Marlboro called
Montana for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Pernod bought them and they
wanted to start exporting their wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't export a wine called Montana
from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a family name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they relabeled it as Brancotta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're there, you'll still hear
people call it Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call it Brancotta.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call it Pernod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Pernod as a whole, the winery
Pernod winemakers in Marlboro make about
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research site I saw was at the
Renwick Estate for Brancotta.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under this Brancotta label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a gorgeous tasting room that
I enjoy frequenting and enjoying since I
[SPEAKER_00]: was blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just sort of a side note on the
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have this reintroducing the
native raptor bird of New Zealand into the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard sites to help control with bird
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, birds are huge,
huge pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys hunt and eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brancotta State is the winery and
vineyards that were helping to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every now and then you see these little
adorable hawks trotted out or falcons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say it's a New Zealand falcon,
trotted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they explain what they're doing to
promote a natural bird control and also
[SPEAKER_00]: help to reintroduce a native species and
get their numbers back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brancotta State, some people might call
this factory winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call it large scale winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about, I'll solidly say it's more
than 4 million cases of wine are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: every year at this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pernod Ricard winery in Blenheim,
otherwise known as Brancotta State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 500 tanks, I think when I was
there, it was well over 600 tanks actively
[SPEAKER_00]: used for fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is under 16 different brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one in the back of the room that I
please encourage everyone to help yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: to a splash of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Brancotta State.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the number one label here
that you're going to see around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other labels they make include Stonely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually exported a lot to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually seen it more around here
in New York than I've seen it like in
[SPEAKER_00]: California or other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the two big brands that
they're quite famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do make several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did take on some contract
winemaking as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big mix of labels, varieties,
kind of a fun way to get my hands dirty in
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, after kind of helping up and
finishing a lot of the cultural data that
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to be collected in the field for
the research, I kind of, I took on a
[SPEAKER_00]: position as a harvest lab tech at Pernod
Ricard, refreshed my winemaking skills a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day in my normal life, as you wake up
at the crack of dawn, beautiful views,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wake up at the crack of dawn to
collect ferment samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the winemakers met, I worked on the
white wine shift, the morning shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the winemakers wanted their wines by
eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant we were out there nice and
bright and early.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the different colors and tape are
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is sav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is Pinot Gris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow Chardonnay, you can see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for the winemakers to taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we monitor the fermentation to see as
sugar is converted to alcohol where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the temperature is okay for
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: For incoming juice samples, say something
just got trucked into a tank, we'll run
[SPEAKER_00]: the juice on that wine scan that I told
you that's so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also run finished wines on that
wine scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also running a lot of analysis on
juice like for pectin and for clarity to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there's any additional processing
that needed to happen to this juice before
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be made into the ferment,
or sent along its way into fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our numbers on the juice and
potential grape samples that came in every
[SPEAKER_00]: day that were running on that wine scan
were helped use to make this incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated planning board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a whole conference room like this
with whiteboards on every side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every whiteboard looks something like this
in the thick of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every individual tag there represents a
block of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really cool, the senior lab
technician I worked with, Arvid,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually came up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, every day in the lab,
you get your grape sample updates or your
[SPEAKER_00]: juice updates, and you'd have to write it
a hand on a tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little magnets were used around
to schedule harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's those tags, though, that in
supermarkets they can put that on or
[SPEAKER_00]: electronic that allow them to update
prices whenever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: He created a computer system and used
these tags to basically update the bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: TA, pH values.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to knowing the cluster
weights, they could estimate the tonnage
[SPEAKER_00]: and thereby estimate tractor time down a
row and how much time it would take for an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual tractor to harvest a block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the winemakers can go into this big
planning room and figure out what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in each day and the timing of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this very big, complicated
organization system, but it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be a part of on how do you make more
than four million cases of wine in a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of planning, and you hope things
don't go wrong, and you hope the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: stays nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my other jobs was, good thing I'm
not scared of heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clamor to the top of approximately
four to five story tall tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our larger tanks held over 500,000
liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would take top of tank temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we had a system that would regulate
the temperature, you had to double check
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you have such tall tanks,
you can get stratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was double checking that this lot
of ferment was uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd scamp around to the top of all the
little catwalks, pop open lids,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop in the temperature probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my big jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also being the lonely minion on the level,
when we got a rainstorm where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: raining inches an hour with probably a 50
mile an hour plus winds, I was the one who
[SPEAKER_00]: got to go to the top of the tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the senior lab tech did come with me
on that one because I think they were
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid of the liability of me being blown
over the catwalk railings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to go get completely drenched
taking top of tank temperatures for
[SPEAKER_00]: winemakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was you know, poor lowly lab tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually had a lot of fun doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be active every day, walk around
the winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I individually touched and handled
every single ferment that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of develop your favorite lots and
you know your problem lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really fun thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rough view of the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: See Arvid's in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi-Viz is a big thing, by the way,
in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always wear Hi-Viz whenever in a
winery or a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very sexy and neon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see Arvid's on the left there
and my coworker Lydia was on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: from that upper picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the lab where Lydia is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We entered in all the data we would
receive off of the wine scan and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis we did into this giant kind of
electronic lab notebook that the
[SPEAKER_00]: winemakers could then access and
automatically write up work orders from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of the really cool
integrated computer systems I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bottom picture, that's Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's monitoring ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have come in later that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice big lab space, but you need it
for, and every inch of that lab was used,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need it for that big of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my special projects I got to be a
part of was we bought a new wine scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wine scan was extra special
because it would also do sulfur analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur is really important in winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It guarantees microbial stability and
keeping wines from oxidizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So otherwise, your methods include either
manual sulfurs, a picture of that large
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical-looking contraption at the top
via aeration oxidation, or we actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: a machine at the lab called a FIASTAR,
which is very temperamental at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to eliminate the FIASTAR was
a big goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is, as I said, all the wine
scan stuff is calibration-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run manual numbers and program it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a calibration curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need very precise calibration to
get good numbers that you trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me being the intern who had extra time
ran hundreds, maybe 1,000 manual sulfurs
[SPEAKER_00]: on different juices and wines,
testing different levels to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of my little extra
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the season, it was
calibrated, and we were using it for
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really nice moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also me being not necessarily the normal
temporary harvest lab tech that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: used to, I pestered the lab manager and
senior lab tech to teach me capillary
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophoresis that's on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that for measuring malic acid for
standardizing that new wine scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also got to play around with the
GCMS a little bit, which we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting off aromas caused by
Britannomyces, a spoilage organism in
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a bit of a program to test
through to make sure none of the lots come
[SPEAKER_00]: in too high for the breath spoilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you do at the end of day
of lab tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have beer with your friends watching
rugby at a bar called Fairweathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Chris kind of towards the left
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, wonderful guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family totally adopted me,
and I had kiwi dinners on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can say is a great thanks to
Chris for his help in both the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as becoming a really good friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon reflection, if I had to pick one
thing I've now learned from working and
[SPEAKER_00]: living in two cool climate viticultural
regions, how would I define a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to pick one thing, it's the
necessary need to add sugar at any point
[SPEAKER_00]: in your fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a warm climate, sugar is kind of the
enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're waiting to keep things on the vine
to accumulate other flavor and aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, but sugar just keeps rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're battling the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cool climate, you often can achieve
the aromatics you want, or for other
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons, are having to harvest,
but you don't have the sugar you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I brought apparently the
coolest, wettest fall they've had in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see, I'm sure they're
embarrassed, Pernod would not be too happy
[SPEAKER_00]: for me showing these photos, but tons,
literal tons and tons and tons of sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: had to be added, especially for the later
lots that were coming in when the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: kept getting increasingly bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of my mental reflection
of the difference, if anyone asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: between cool climate or climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever added added sugar,
you're a cool climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winemaker, Greg, actually led me and a
couple other seasonal workers and other
[SPEAKER_00]: employees through a big tasting of all the
different labels in wines and compared
[SPEAKER_00]: this year's wines to last year,
you know, to pre-bottled wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really fun tasting experience to
kind of get my head around the giant
[SPEAKER_00]: portfolio of wines that I just helped
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wine that you see here in the
screw cap bottler is a little special.
[SPEAKER_00]: My very first week of work, I was
monitoring the fermentation of,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is their low alcohol label,
called their flight series wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: called lunch wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their low alcohol Pinot Gris.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my very last week of work, I bottled
out the samples to be sent to Auckland so
[SPEAKER_00]: they could prep to bottle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be shipped out that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw whole wines from start to finish
in my little duration in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapped up harvest there, had a great
time and traveled a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wonderful boyfriend, Dan, joined me for
the last part of New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you the kind of last bits of
my travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did give this seminar,
I gave a seminar at Plant and Food and I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave a seminar at Lincoln earlier before
harvest had started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also got to visit Christchurch again
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Glenn Creasy of, you know, Dr. Creasy's
son, who had been part of this department,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a viticulture professor at Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and his family wonderfully welcomed
me into his home and hosted me and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged me to give a seminar there on
my work that I've done here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really wonderful opportunity
to visit the campus, see their viticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: department and their school vineyards
there and meet Glenn and kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand academic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I felt very thankful to
be asked to give a seminar while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I got to do a fun little
visit through Christchurch on my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got to take a little blue
penguin selfie.
[SPEAKER_00]: My five-year-old self could not have been
happier by this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Antarctic center in
Christchurch where I got to go see little
[SPEAKER_00]: blue penguins that have otherwise been
injured or incapable of being re-released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a fun way of seeing them up
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But penguins, as I said, are a
strongholding theme of this trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming down south, this is big penguin
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped at Omaru, where there's a
little blue penguin colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see them at the right times of
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see them twice come up shore
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nocturnal, and they come in from
the ocean at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they have their own little
hobbit holes that they live in during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and nest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to see this whole little no
higher than one foot herd of penguins
[SPEAKER_00]: ascend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the cutest thing I have ever seen
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I will ever have a
happier moment in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was fortunate enough to go to a
penguin reserve in Dunedin, where the most
[SPEAKER_00]: endangered penguin in the world,
so thereby the rarest as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the yellow-eyed penguin in native to
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're solitary, unlike every other
penguin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like other penguins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only hang out by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really endangered mostly due
to habitat destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only a few places in the world
you can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cool little site that has
little look boxes that you can hide in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just come up close and
waddle by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the guys chilling out there
after a day in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a site further south that we
travel to called Curio Bay, where this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a beach which is also awesome because it's
a petrified forest fossil site on the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wait to the right time of day,
the penguins come in onshore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just sitting there on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penguins come no further from me than
anyone who's in the back row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just hop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them swimming, hop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you watch them go back into the forest
to their nesting sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also one of those things that
all I can say was completely magical to
[SPEAKER_00]: see some of my favorite creatures in the
wild that close to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only in New Zealand could you just
walk onto a beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have park rangers there
during the not nesting parts of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not enough people in New
Zealand, especially in remote areas like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nearest town, nearest grocery store is
probably two hours away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just remote enough that you can
still get very, very close to nature in
[SPEAKER_00]: some very special ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sort of did a meandering trip
through the mountains and lakes of New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queenstown was an awesome place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, in fact, go bungee jumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a better picture,
unfortunately, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ledge right there, you jump over
the view of Queenstown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't go to the home of extreme sports
and not partake in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was me up there looking very
accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also have quite a few ice
bars in Queenstown, which are fun to
[SPEAKER_00]: visit, although I could have just gone
outside here and experienced the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milford Sound, one of the most spectacular
nature preserves, I think, on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were there on a day that was pouring
rain, pouring rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did get to see thousands and
thousands of waterfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a few beautiful sites
as you drive into the reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Mirror Lake for its very
mirror-like attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to return one day when it's not so
pouring rain so I can actually see some
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very fun to go see such huge,
huge crevasses, because it's a fjord
[SPEAKER_00]: carved by glaciers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sail your boat down the middle,
and you get to see huge kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mountainous-like stone and like thousands
of waterfalls gushing down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then made our way through lake country,
kind of detoured from our original plan
[SPEAKER_00]: due to weather concerns, because this is
now early winter in New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I saw probably what I think is the
most stunning view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Lake Takapo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's called the Southern
Alps, that mountain range throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: south of New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a glacier-fed lake that has an
awesome blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can say is, once again,
it's one of the most stunning views I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't done with Lord of the Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bypassed most of the nerdiest stuff
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't ignore that I climbed another
mountain in the name of Lord of the Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second movie, Two Towers,
the people of Rohan live in Edoras.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there is Edoras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a nature preserve,
they had to tear down the set completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole mountain set and the little
trails they used are still right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hike up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of drive off a very, very beaten
path down dirt, gravel roads, and went up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also kind of a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was awesome to say we climbed
Edoras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's amazing about this view is this
was like not at all CGI-edited,
[SPEAKER_00]: the views from that scene or that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the view you get when you're
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see all these mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow-capped mountains and beautiful
plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we ended up retracing the steps I
had formerly taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be brief about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sort of made our way all the way
reluctantly back up to Auckland,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we'd be flying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to stop at Hobbiton again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lord of the Rings thing is not minor
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly in Wellington, when we stopped
off, there's the Weta Workshop,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Weta Cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the special effects kind of
agency and props group that Peter Jackson
[SPEAKER_00]: had founded at the time of Lord of the
Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've since done a lot of other movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these full-scale models and
trolls and the actual weapons used in Lord
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a full tour there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopped off in Rotorua, where my father
had been all those years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're famous for their geothermal hot
springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an amazing museum that Ian
Merwin had recommended to me that I hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very thankful for that
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually did hit Blenheim
before going back to the North Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Brancotta State, that tasting
room vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there, mostly at leaf drop
stage, some few straggling yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to kind of see the vineyard
through the peak and through the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reluctant, but actually did go to
the Watomo Glow Worm Caves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the number one Google
tourist site thing to see in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe I was hesitant to not
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these little glow worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they line the ceiling of these
naturally formed limestone caves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's simply breathtaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made our way back to Auckland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the beautiful little sky tower
there, which we then took an elevator up
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a beautiful panoramic view
around the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sat there relaxing before we were
catching a flight much later that evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought it was of note.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my last day, I was looking out on that
bridge right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the very first bridge I took out
and drove off on to go to the Northland
[SPEAKER_00]: right after picking up my car in New
Zealand and heading off on my adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a nice big full circle of closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have talked for six weeks about my
six month trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep it reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really can't thank the juror
committee enough for this life changing
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did I get to fulfill a dream I've
had since I can't even remember and see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the most beautiful and spectacular
images in nature I can imagine exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the career opportunities I was
afforded by going there and connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: with researchers and getting an
international perspective, I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: told directly by a few of the people who
have hired me that it was impressive to
[SPEAKER_00]: have such diverse experience between
California, New York, and now New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can say is thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few people have been asking me,
what have I been doing since?
[SPEAKER_00]: After I finished up my master's,
I went on to work as a viticultural and
[SPEAKER_00]: lab technician at Quintessa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm actually just about to start my
position as a viticulture farm advisor for
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, I've been told by a few
people in that position that my
[SPEAKER_00]: diversified experience greatly contributed
to me as a candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really thankful I got to share
those experiences with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help yourself with some wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions for Lindsay or we're going to
get to work.
Questions and wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you start at Perced?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when I get back from New York,
I've offered a few days so hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: weather doesn't mess up my plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already been going to a few workshops
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met all the extension agents already
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to get going and get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So River has it that the Marlboro style is
developing into even greater foster care
[SPEAKER_01]: and is based simply on the North American
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down I believe that because it's all
export market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of New Zealand wines, the vast
majority of them are exported,
[SPEAKER_00]: is mostly made for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both Canada buys a lot too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Sweden is sort of another big buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also America for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that you're getting domestically
for sure have a bit of a different pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there's still Marlboro style blanc
but I think they tend to be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced and a little less in your face
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's also they're a little
more delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're a little more complex
wines that you don't wrap your head
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially domestically you get the
top tier labels that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Brand Cod Estate makes a chosen
row wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or white especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's incredibly nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all Marlboro style.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are playing around a lot with
oak exposure to some of the ones which is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually really fun to see and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the oaks out in a lot of forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when I was in Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think New Zealand's doing it very
delicately and well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the others later profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed a lot more there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say they're more subdued but I
certainly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed from my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Brand Cod.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand Cod blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they have to make so many cases
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said it's because that's who's
buying most of New Zealand's wine is the
[SPEAKER_00]: export market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I easily could believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's probably true that the steps
here more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen numbers to by any means
promise that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that I would agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's interesting because we just
absolutely fell in love with the New
[SPEAKER_03]: Orleans that we tried while we were in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't been able to find any in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean most of my labels I can't even art
export it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me I knew I was out of luck when it
came to some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Doctor's Riesling is one of my
absolute favorite Riesling of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wins a lot of awards every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't export.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty small production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just also if you're tasting it
local it's probably because they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly export wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a tasting room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bottled warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a cargo ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no medium in which to taste there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're tasting there are people
who are looking to sell there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no smaller market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay how much mechanization goes on?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still handpicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff we still handpicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of varies by lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it, vast majority of it is machine
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vast majority of it is spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do give a can of leaf fitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see sheep leaf fitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently as long as you put them in
there before the berries start to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: ever raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do best jobs that they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than humans even.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still hand pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a lot of cane pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no easy way to mechanize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have enough labor to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor is always a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rely heavily on backpackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like traveling backpackers who make some
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big culture of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some ties that come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other Indonesian populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People from Fiji are going to want to and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For violence that also comes from labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the vast majority is mechanized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the smaller regions,
more boutique regions that can afford the
[SPEAKER_00]: hand labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can find it because they're all so
small that you need your two fingers to
[SPEAKER_00]: guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can cope with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Waiheke Island comes to mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a lot of mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mauro, all that big stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way you can harvest it all
in that narrow time frame anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely do still see some hand
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in more of the smaller regions
that I showed on that map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Hawke's Bay it was a lot of hand
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vines are still manicured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick kept laughing at me because I'm
like, they're naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could sleep in up to five or six
nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything's just, they have one
cluster of parachute and they'd be so
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect and manicured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of hand work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously there's stuff that's still
machine-prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very little mechanical pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know it's a lot as backpacker
pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept having a joke that I could have
probably fed myself better pruning than I
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been working in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know how to cane prune very well
after being in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could have whipped through compared
to most of these backpackers who've never
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up a parachute pruning chair
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's mechanical pre-pruning for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it's still hand work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
