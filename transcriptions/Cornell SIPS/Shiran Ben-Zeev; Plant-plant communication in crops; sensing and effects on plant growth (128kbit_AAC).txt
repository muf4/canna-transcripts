[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so thanks, Luke, for the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I want to share some of what
I've been doing and listening to Luke and
[SPEAKER_02]: preparing for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you sum up everything I did for a short
period of time, it seems like I've done a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really nice thing to reflect
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did make this plan for what I wanted
to touch on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prepared for this, and I ran this a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can either go really quickly and be
way too quick, or I might be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: over, so I'll try and be cognizant of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize in advance for any
discrepancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to do is I want to talk a
little bit about how I got to do what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing and some of the stuff I did during
my PhD, which was working on TEF,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then how that led to plant-to-plant
interactions, and then working on stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done recently, things we are doing,
and things we hope to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to hope to leave a lot of
time for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, everyone I've interacted with here
has been both kind and smart, so I really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hear what you all have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on a farm since I was
11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been driving tractors for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was, I guess, pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on multiple crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But working on crops is actually not where
my interest in plants came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell in love with plants here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are meadows that are very close to
my home, where I would hike as a child.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of my favorite places in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you look at where I got
interested in plants, you can see just how
[SPEAKER_02]: many plants grow here together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a sharp contrast to the monoculture
you see behind of grapes and almonds and
[SPEAKER_02]: olives and all that, you have legumes here
and cereals here and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: other genres and families all growing
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what makes them as much
as us.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes them appealing is how diverse
they are, how interesting they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they get along.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there really wasn't a study the
meadows behind your house class,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I went into crop science instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started learning about TEF as an
undergrad working in Professor Yoshua
[SPEAKER_02]: Saranga's lab at the Hebrew University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very early on, it piqued my interest
because I found out that TEF has a very
[SPEAKER_02]: large demand in Israel, which is not where
it's endemic to.
[SPEAKER_02]: TEF is a cereal crop that's endemic to
Ethiopia, if any of you are unfamiliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the early 90s, there was a big wave
of repatriotism of Jews who came from
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethiopia to Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they continued to consume TEF as their
staple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being recent immigrants, this wasn't the
best well-off population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, the cost they paid
for the staple flour was three times as
[SPEAKER_02]: high as that of wheat flour, which to us,
it made a screen to high heavens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got interested in lowering the
price by producing it locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, farmers in Israel,
as well as here, always needed more crops
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always need more things to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a specific need for a short
season cereal crop that can utilize excess
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and water from the soil for
specific farmers, specifically those who
[SPEAKER_02]: grew carrots and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a large interest in TEF.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with all that in mind, we said,
hey, let's work on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can grow TEF in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting off, we had some ideas of how
TEF grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these were non-obvious when we
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were going off of some ideas we got
from people who came from Ethiopia and
[SPEAKER_02]: were farmers previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spent substantial amounts of time
trying to adapt practices used in
[SPEAKER_02]: smallholder traditional farming in
Ethiopia to highly mechanized,
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigated agriculture like the type we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to answer each of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So literally, which planter to use for
these tiny seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: When to sow?
[SPEAKER_02]: How to irrigate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we use sprinklers or pivots?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we even get the right yields?
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of genetics we needed for those
yields?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, we focused on lodging,
which I'm going to touch on heavily in
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also had the question of how
to harvest, which actually became the
[SPEAKER_02]: easiest one to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Googled TEF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found a video from Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish everything was that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything else, we had to calibrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we literally had to ask that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did get some answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't go into the whole process of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'd find that if we sowed in early
spring, we got up to 150% more yield
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to some other periods throughout
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the timing was crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also found out that,
as luck would have it, there was a planter
[SPEAKER_02]: that was heavily sold back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 80s, a great planter that had a
small seed chamber in it that fit TEF very
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty accurate in sowing
densities, which you'll soon realize is
[SPEAKER_02]: very important as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also tested what the right density of
plants was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that that produced really
high increases in yield as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And TEF seeds being this big, which is
about between a fifth or a third of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sesame seed, so teeny tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to find out if we can sow them or
actually cover them with soil and not put
[SPEAKER_02]: them on the soil surface, which was what
farmers were doing at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: since they looked at these plants and
said, this is never going to make it out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we actually found out that they can
make it from pretty substantial depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that if we covered them, we decreased
seed desiccation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got better establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got better anchorage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the roots, the shoot to root junction
happened below the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that improved the plant anchorage,
which was a major determinant in logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for the genetics and how to get the
best yields, I feel like it's like I won
[SPEAKER_02]: the lottery.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of luck involved in this,
as with any science.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to work on TEF.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We reached out to Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made clear to us that that's never
going to happen and not a single seed was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to leave their germplasm to come to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we looked locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went to a conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spoke to someone who worked with the
Israeli Gene Bank and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we have TEF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we found out that we actually had
a collection that was collected by the
[SPEAKER_02]: USDA in the 50s and 60s, brought here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something was done to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for whatever reason, it was
shipped to Israel to be shared with
[SPEAKER_02]: Israeli researchers and basically
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know who ordered it, who got it,
who maintained it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with those somewhere pretty
obvious mixtures of different colors of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to stabilize them genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a single seed descent, stabilizing
phase, and created a panel of just under
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then used that panel for two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, we tested it in a bunch of different
locations, trying to see if anything
[SPEAKER_02]: stands out and if we can see a line that's
readily adaptable to Israeli agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'll share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it to some of you this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just found out that one of the lines we
started licensing is enter the final
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but it's the line
that's named after my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we used that panel to do a GBS.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then used that GBS data to do a
preliminary GWAS and try and map E traits
[SPEAKER_02]: to specific loci.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to find hits for a lot of
important traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the really cool thing we found is that
multiple sites were shared between the
[SPEAKER_02]: three biggest things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were targeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So days to heading, grain yield,
and lodging index all shared specific
[SPEAKER_02]: locations of the genome, which was a very
exciting find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both Muluken, who worked on this with me,
and I have since finished and moved to
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm really hoping somebody picks this
up because I think it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the big issue we were dealing
with is lodging, which is what you see
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm about to say is it's somewhat
contested in the science ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope nobody gets offended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lodging, generally, is the permanent
displacement of a plant from the upright
[SPEAKER_02]: position.
[SPEAKER_02]: That part is not contested.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is contested is if this is root
lodging or shoot lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the literature, root lodging is a
partial uprooting, which I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shoot lodging is a bending of the
shoot, which also happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it happens after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to say it's root lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're contested, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compared to a three-celled or supported
growth, this leads to up to 50% yield
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction in both biomass and grain yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this environment that's created here
is the perfect place for bugs and fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: and pathogens of all natures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big, big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to make things worse, it makes it
really hard for the harvester to go over
[SPEAKER_02]: it because those plants are stuck under.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been possibly less of an issue in
Ethiopia where most of the harvesting is
[SPEAKER_02]: still manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of those losses still apply there
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was a TA at the time, which I loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was a TA for Intro to Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things we got to talking
about is shoot development and the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: that shading has on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, hey, maybe, TA brain at the
time, maybe the plants are sensing
[SPEAKER_02]: shading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thus, they are becoming taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thus, they're losing their anchorage
because the center of gravity rises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why they topple over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, OK, what causes this and
possibly higher densities?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty short jump in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a context to this, when we started
out, the data we had was that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: sowing up to 20 kilograms per hectare,
which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking billions of plants per a few
meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, OK, this is probably too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to nine kilograms, which is
about half all the way down to three
[SPEAKER_02]: kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for stumbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really use hectares in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use dunams because hectares are way too
big in the country's width.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we did this, we found that the
plants grown in lower densities were
[SPEAKER_02]: taller, not shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't seem to be that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we found that lodging was reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that got me interested, and I was
trying to yank those plants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also found that the plants here just
held onto the ground more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called anchorage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pointed to another thing that
pointed us in the direction of root
[SPEAKER_02]: lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I felt, was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got to thinking, what in the
root could it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is about the time that Jonathan
Lynch, who at the time I was afraid of,
[SPEAKER_02]: now I know him, is actually very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a paper about root cortical and
chima.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that got us thinking about,
maybe that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of the areas of the cortex are
deforming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the connection between the side
that's attached to the soil and the side
[SPEAKER_02]: that is definitely connected to the shoot,
maybe something there breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we looked at it, we saw that some
of the more lodging resistant lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're not resistant completely,
but more so, they produced less root
[SPEAKER_02]: cortical and chima.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also produced it later in the
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had improved retention of the
cortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we think is happening is that with
the partial uprooting, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant secondary uprooting that's
happening inside the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the steel could be just moving inside,
much like a fiber moves inside an
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical wire, because it's not
connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could enable some flexibility to
enable the plant to switch without
[SPEAKER_02]: disconnecting, because we're not seeing
the roots cut, but we do see the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: lying on its side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really happy about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a simple light microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to know the right
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can show you what it looks like
under a scanning electron microscope,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was done by other people in a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that second work also found that other
metrics of the root cortical area changed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it seems to be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be that if a plant tends to
lodge, that root cortical and chima is
[SPEAKER_02]: developed more and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what starts the process,
but there's definitely something going on
[SPEAKER_02]: with root anatomy when it comes to
lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of what we knew about the
densities and the changes we found based
[SPEAKER_02]: on densities, that got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are plants telling one another what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are plants picking up signals that
make them change their anatomy and their
[SPEAKER_02]: development, resulting in lodging of other
metrics?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really how I landed in
plant-plant interactions, which is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: the in-between stage between my PhD and my
postdoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is not new to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants grow in diverse communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't believe me, there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also under cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So polycultures have been used for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all know this Three Sisters Garden
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an embodiment of symbiosis,
because the beans grow on top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: maize, getting support.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fixate nitrogen as a way of repaying
the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way it's depicted, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the squash grows and covers the
soil, taking advantage of excess
[SPEAKER_02]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know this happens, and we know it
works sustainably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for all we know about plant-plant
interaction, the below ground part is less
[SPEAKER_02]: well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you why, because it's
really hard to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of hard work, and it's the
invisible part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll spoil the rest of this,
but I also focused on root exudates,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the invisible part of the
invisible part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to study, but it holds a
tremendous benefit potential, because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a big emphasis on plant-soil and
plant-microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those plant-plant interactions,
specifically intra-species ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: they cloud our view.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produce noise to other questions that
we're asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to get to know Jesse
Lasky, who also thought that was
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won a Bard fellowship to go and get
my postdoc with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been the previous two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a pretty short time before I came,
this paper came out from the Lasky lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: which showed that in Arabidopsis plants,
if all other things being equal and no
[SPEAKER_02]: shortage of nutrients, no shortage of
water, the presence of competing plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: inter and intra-species, caused changes to
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this specific paper, they were also
able to mimic it by using a stragolactone
[SPEAKER_02]: standard and got similar responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had an idea that the root exudates
played a role here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was amazed at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole new topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spent some time thinking about how
plants communicate with one another,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse the very, I'm not a good drawer,
I'm not good at drawing, and less so in a
[SPEAKER_02]: computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can think of some channels of
plants communicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about shading.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's volatiles above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff that plants exude towards
one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there are microbes that are
either shared or are used to transfer
[SPEAKER_02]: cues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we can talk about
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also say that I knew this was
important because we know that agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: is becoming ever more intensified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know plants are growing in higher
and higher densities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is my hope that with regenerative
agriculture and with newer, more
[SPEAKER_02]: eco-friendly systems, we're going to mix
some crops at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So intercropping became something that I
was interested in as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other question I had being that I
worked with plant selection and breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: before was, is this breedable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something we can breed for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not a new idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the late 60s, people have been
talking about doing the selection of new
[SPEAKER_02]: lines under higher densities because
agriculture was expected to keep on
[SPEAKER_02]: intensifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you probably know about the leaf angle
changes in corn that make the plants fit
[SPEAKER_02]: better together and share more of the
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are all above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Below ground traits that could benefit
higher densities were less well-documented
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was something we were very
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also thought that because seeds are
sown very close to one another and they
[SPEAKER_02]: take longer to shade one another than to
start exuding towards one another,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably root-to-root sensing happens
before shading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to try and check what the effect of
this was, and there was a paper that
[SPEAKER_02]: showed that you can even transfer
flowering signals through root exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was definitely enough evidence to
support working on the communication below
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and trying to remove that from the
context of above ground interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tested 10 sorghum lines,
some were land braces, some were elite
[SPEAKER_02]: lines, all of which we grew under high,
high fertilizer abundance with either
[SPEAKER_02]: drought conditions or well water
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did not allow plants to shade one
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did was we divided, we had focal
plants of the 10 genotypes we tested and
[SPEAKER_02]: we grew them in pots encircled by multiple
plants or a single genotype that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: same competitor for all of these 10 lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one competitor competing against 10
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we at first used these plates to push
the plants to the side, the plants lifted
[SPEAKER_02]: the plate with no issue at all,
then we tied them off to remove the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: from being able to interact with one
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that did produce stress, but we didn't
see really signs of stress of those
[SPEAKER_02]: competitor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we asked the question,
how does this affect the productivity and
[SPEAKER_02]: the development of plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was that the presence of
competition, which is the one on the
[SPEAKER_02]: second to the right, produced a smaller
plant, reduced biomass, reduced the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: height and reduced the leaf area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was on par with the control of a
non-competition, this is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: non-competition, a non-competition
drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So drought and the presence of neighbors
led to similar reductions in productivity
[SPEAKER_02]: in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is intra-species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a sorghum plant sensing neighbors
around it reduced its productivity almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was experiencing drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we looked at for the synthesis
measurements of stomatal conductance and
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2 activity, sorry, and we saw a
reduction in that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only is it smaller, it's reducing
less, it's less productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could be, I can put this in a
very kind context of saying it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trying not to steal everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making itself small as a sort of
survival through conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could be that there's something
going on there that's reducing its
[SPEAKER_02]: activity, similar to what we found in
Arabidopsis before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw that below ground interactions
led to this reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, OK, so if it's below ground,
there's multiple things we can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be removal of nutrients on a very
micro scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So close to the root, maybe that's what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's a biochemical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's an exudate thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are exuding something that's
causing other plants to reduce their
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, then we use this
very high tech system of a bucket and a
[SPEAKER_02]: funnel and a tube where we grew source
plants separately in a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collected the leachate from this pot
that had all the riso deposits from the
[SPEAKER_02]: same competitor genotype, and we
transferred it to a target pot that either
[SPEAKER_02]: had actual competition in addition to this
leachate or just this leachate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were wondering, is this Q
transported by exudates?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the nature of that interaction will
be different?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answers are very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is a signal that's carried by
exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it's not different in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found here was that the
presence of the leachate of competing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants was similar in its effect to
physical competition, plants grown in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found something that is very
important for my current response to
[SPEAKER_02]: reviewers, where we did not see a
heightened response when we had both
[SPEAKER_02]: competition and leachate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of you are probably thinking
allelopathy and autotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Autotoxicity, when it is created,
produces a linear response across almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would have been here if this was a
natural autotoxicity effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a little bit bitter about it
because I had paper ejected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was one thing we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And working with sorghum, I was interested
in what it did to other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are two reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is when you dive into the literature
about sorghum, there is a ton of paper
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that if you grow sorghum,
the weed population is decreased,
[SPEAKER_02]: which didn't sit well with my experience
of seeing weeds in sorghum fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another thing was that we did a
lot of work in Jesse Lasky's lab about
[SPEAKER_02]: working with striaga and sorghum-striaga
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Striaga is a parasitic plant in
sub-Saharan Africa that peaks on sorghum
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a major yield-reducing element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things in the process of
working on it was getting root exudates to
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate striaga seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had that system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering, and I was lucky
enough to know Dr. Carolyn Lowry,
[SPEAKER_02]: who worked with me on this, if we could
see, in effect, this plant-plant
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction between the root exudates that
work so immensely on striaga seeds on some
[SPEAKER_02]: key weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both common water hemp and foxtail are,
this is giant foxtail, are major weeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found, yes, the plants that were 5
to 14 days old, we grew them in nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then transferred them into DI water for
three days, let them exude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used that to germinate seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that those exudates reduced
germination of both these species,
[SPEAKER_02]: both foxtail and common water hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were germinated to a lesser extent
when exposed to these exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were wondering if there was a
killer agent in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a thing where the seeds just die?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a toxic element to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we checked for seed viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with us seeing no reduction in seed
viability, what we think is happening is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is a secondary induced dormancy
that's happening in the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: which seems to go along with gap sensing,
which is a thing that small seeded weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: are known for, that if they see the light,
see in parentheses, but if they sense the
[SPEAKER_02]: sunlight, if there is a niche that's
available for them to occupy, they will
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps what we're seeing is that
those exudates serve as another agent
[SPEAKER_02]: sending the message of this area is
taking, there is no gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we're thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also looked at early development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw in common water hemp,
we didn't see any effect because the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: were so tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a smaller ruler to test this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all within noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we found something interesting that
with giant foxtail, the seeds that did
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate developed much quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they elongated much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produced a higher root mass when they
were exposed to these exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to run a little bit through
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of this work on sorghum led us and
my reviewers to talk about allelopathy,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I dove in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I jumped into that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say that the original paper,
the seminal paper for allelopathy says
[SPEAKER_02]: that allelopathy is any interaction
between one plant and another,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily deleterious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm seeing here is allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not autotoxicity, not
allelopathy in the common way that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll excuse the football joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with this in mind and this paper being
written, I started a new postdoc working
[SPEAKER_02]: on intercropping with the understanding
that with newer practices coming along,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to need intercropping to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the benefits of intercropping,
depending on who you read, are immense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything from nutrient availability going
up to pest resistance going up to higher
[SPEAKER_02]: yields, they're all presented as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us, they fit another idea that my
current advisor, Dr. Goji Wang,
[SPEAKER_02]: has in mind, where if we convinced
Pennsylvania farmers who are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: silage to replace 10% of their corn plants
with soy and sorghum, we can get a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: protein content in the silage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get a higher sugar content,
making the instilling process quicker
[SPEAKER_02]: without substantial yield reduction,
making a better product quicker for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cows to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the secondary effect that we are also
very interested in is because there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of dairy farms and a lot of cows
producing a lot of manure, that manure
[SPEAKER_02]: gets put on the fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers then get fined if there's
leaching of nitrogen or runoff of
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus because it leads into the
Chesapeake Bay and causes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: troubles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are evidence in the literature
where if you grow this, you get higher
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is why we're interested in
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to thinking about those three
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of everything I'm going to
present in the next couple of minutes was
[SPEAKER_02]: done by these three women, Risha over
there and Marin and Deirdre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did basic things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're undergrads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very lucky to have had them work
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were wondering, in planting these,
how much longer do I have?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to leave time for questions,
we should stop around one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to thinking about how those
fields of intercropping might look like
[SPEAKER_02]: and what the practices might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it was very obvious that we
should tell the farmers, plant the soy and
[SPEAKER_02]: sorghum first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them establish they are slower
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You Americans, you did a great job with
your corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows so quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was amazed the first couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not the same effort has been done on
soy and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, let's plant those first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then put in the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was assured that there's no way the
farmers are going to go twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, we knew that soy and sorghum
are going to be germinating in an area
[SPEAKER_02]: that has corn plants that are bigger and
already exuding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got thinking, what would the effect
be?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would the exudates do in terms of
early development, which we did in these
[SPEAKER_02]: germination papers, and to actual
germination, which we did in pit
[SPEAKER_02]: revisions?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew these all three species in a
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then transferred the exudates to plates
or to these tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see what the effect was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what the seedlings look like
in germination paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw that for corn, any sort of
exudates that you put next to the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced its germination rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a heightened sensitivity
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found that sorghum does not care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will just germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw it's more picky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with corn and sorghum, there was a
reduction in germination rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: With soy exudates, soy seeds germinating
in soy exudates, no substantial reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also looked at germinating
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a hydrothermal timeline model,
which we applied to the germination data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was the water was
constantly the fastest to induce
[SPEAKER_02]: germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not find any effect for corn
between soy and corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw a reduction in sorghum for all
three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it germinated less and slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could be, by the way, that that
slower effect is just the decomposing of
[SPEAKER_02]: the exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how long some of the
compounds in the exudates live for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not done that metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what those compounds are
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also did some early
development tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found a response in corn in terms
of total root length.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the exudates, once again, soy and corn
did not really induce a strong response.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with sorghum, we saw a reduction to
the point of the same level of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, once again, like I showed
you with the foxtail, the seeds that did
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate here developed quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the same time period, they produced
more roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be that they're trying to
compete more.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the shoot dry weight,
we saw that the corn plants germinating in
[SPEAKER_02]: corn exudates were the biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a response.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also saw an interesting response in soy
where the shoots of plants of seedlings in
[SPEAKER_02]: corn exudates of soy were the biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe once they're realizing they're
under competition, they carry things
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we're thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at shoot root ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for lack of time, I might not go into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're analyzing this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're thinking about what we want to
do next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the literature now has two different
opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're both equally as loud,
if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be that corn plants uptake
more phosphorus by just sensing the
[SPEAKER_02]: existence of soy plants next to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been claimed in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other papers say, no, actually,
the exudates from soy plants make
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus more available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why there's increased uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a paper that showed that
there is a higher transcription of
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus transporters in the roots of
corn plants grown with soy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But recently, there's been a seed
correction thing added to that paper
[SPEAKER_02]: where, if you look at it, it's not really
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very curious about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we can cause plants to uptake
more phosphorus just by putting in
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates, it's like a biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to grow them in water and use
that water in irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bang, we get more phosphorus in the
corn plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that exists, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing we are thinking about,
and I'll maybe just say that quickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: jump to my summary, is there is a claim
that soy plants will fix more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're grown next to corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that is not evolutionary stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason for a plant to be
altruistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be that they're expecting some
nitrogen deficiencies later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are not plants that have
co-evolved for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are very curious about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we're planning to do now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to ask these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing we are doing is
growing all three plants in a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: solution with high nutrient availability
to try and see what the roots do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're later going to try and grow them in
pots and see if we see elevated uptake,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I don't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting situation where I
do actually have a two-sided hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The literature can point you in both
directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if any of it works, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I'm very hopeful can
lead to better outcomes for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one last thing I wanted to say is
that I recently partnered with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanical Society of America, for which
I'm hosting a new podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Jenny, I just realized you were on
the last one, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's super, super important
for us to present our science in a more
[SPEAKER_02]: approachable and easy-to-find way for the
general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in this day and age, and I was
strictly warned by my advisors to not talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about politics, but I think we all do what
we do because we believe it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think truth needs to be as easily
accessible as misleading information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my small attempt at doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be launched in the next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if any of you are working on anything
related to plants and are either members
[SPEAKER_02]: of or affiliated with the Botanical
Society of America, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really fun experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fun to talk to on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really easy experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are expected to have a big
crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: One o'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I think we can start with
questions in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a slide for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some research in our lab suggests that
maize plant through different compounds as
[SPEAKER_00]: they develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you play at all with the age of your
maize or other plants in capturing their
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am expecting to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is that I had the
fortune of overlapping with Erica
[SPEAKER_02]: Lawrence-Paul, who is a big vegetative
phase change expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even know it from Stryker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've not done that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we were planning to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, so plant-plant
interactions, I've done a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: work in crop-weed interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing, plant-plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you familiar with Clarence Swanton's
work from the University of Guelph?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, because I think it goes
along nicely with this research,
[SPEAKER_04]: where he also proposes that crop yields
being limited by weeds, yes, there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility and shading element.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even before any of that, he proposes
that the primary thing that is limiting
[SPEAKER_04]: these yields are just the sensing of
somehow this weed or this crop is sensing
[SPEAKER_04]: that there is another plant in its
vicinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was when you got into
exudates and allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of the weed biomass work
that we do is all above ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: but so much is happening underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's plant-plant interactions,
but also crop-weed interactions,
[SPEAKER_04]: same kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also feeds into some work that's
been done in Penn State with Kava.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do mixtures, and those mixtures
actually do better than monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we should probably be looking
deeper into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse the pun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so plant breeding is, in part,
a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to measure as many plants as we
can just to do selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned idiotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if your research suggests
some kind of intercropping idiotype that
[SPEAKER_03]: is faster to measure than, say,
growing the intercrop and making a biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: cut and separating out the species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something that comes out of your
work that we could select on that would,
[SPEAKER_03]: by indirect selection, improve intercrop
performance?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about it for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for one thing, as a way of making
the selection more high throughput,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll touch on that with Greg,
I think if we did hydroponics and we
[SPEAKER_02]: played around with the species in there,
allowing for greater interaction and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the performance, it's not the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very artificial, but it might give us
a way forward, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I have envisioned it is with
the NFT system, where the top length is
[SPEAKER_02]: the exuding one and all of the rest are
experiencing some sort of a gradient of
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing we wanted to achieve with that
Sorghum work was we wanted to get RNA-seq
[SPEAKER_02]: data from before and after the exposure to
the exudates and the exudate transfer
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As life happens, we missed the deadline on
one grant, and then my fellowship ran out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not end up doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could see stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we did this in an environment
that had multiple nutrients availability
[SPEAKER_02]: or varying nutrients availability,
we can tease apart the receptors on the
[SPEAKER_02]: root that respond to that specific
element, and that might give us a better
[SPEAKER_02]: target for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely think it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing that we are running out
of alleles for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the root is maybe an anti-up resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I do think it's a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One question online.
[SPEAKER_05]: David, it looks like you have your hand
raised.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with Clarence Wanton quite a bit,
and our hypothesis is that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize each other, and that's why you
get reduced yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the case, then it should be
possible to identify mutants that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to those chemicals, that just
ignore them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about looking for mutants
that do not respond to the exudate
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did hope that if we grew land braces,
we might see variation in the direction of
[SPEAKER_02]: response.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did see variation in the magnitude of
the response to exudates, so there could
[SPEAKER_02]: be some differences there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very small sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 10 lines, and they were mixed
between land braces and elite lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it wasn't a really good panel to ask
that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not done this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that we looked at, or I looked
at some strigolactone sensing mutants in
[SPEAKER_02]: peas doing some other work, and I am less
convinced that strigolactones are the key
[SPEAKER_02]: agent in this sensing, but I could be
wrong about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: With sorghum, those mutants weren't
readily available for us to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be a logical next step,
which we're hoping to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grants becoming available again,
permitting and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, we do have a lot of
RNA-seq data online for plant-weed
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to mine it for whatever
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions in the room?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's thank the speaker once again.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
