[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today I just want to talk to you
guys a little bit about my work on trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to model a couple of different chromatin
states across species directly from DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a flavor of deep learning model
known as the correct convolutional neural
[SPEAKER_00]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get too deeply into that,
I want to contextualize why we might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick chromatin state in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that accessible chromatin
regulates gene expression and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression most of the time in vivo
is tightly wrapped around histones and
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But transcription factors bind to this
accessible chromatin, this open chromatin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go on to regulate gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that not all these regulatory
regions are close to the genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be up to, for example,
a maze up to 100 kilobases away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important not just to localize to
accessible regions close to genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also figure out where they are in
crystal forces of genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to put this all together,
we can then hypothesize that variation
[SPEAKER_00]: within these accessible regions will lead
to variation in transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: binding, which will lead to variation in
gene expression and then go on to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence all the phenotypes that we care
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a more concrete example of this,
there was a study in May across 40
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits in two populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was they took the partition
of the phenotypic variants that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and they partitioned that further
down to SNPs that were associated in
[SPEAKER_00]: different annotation classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can see here is across both
populations about half of the variation is
[SPEAKER_00]: attributable to SNPs and encoding regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect this, and no protein sequence is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's also striking is that variation
within accessible regions is almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: important as variation in encoding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests to me that it's also very
important to identify where these
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible regions are if you want to
improve them and improve prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important proven state is DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a recent paper in Grasses showed
that if you look at the chromatin state
[SPEAKER_00]: across different tissues, you can see that
they're all unmethylated, the accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we also know about DNA
methylation state across developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: time is it's very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the suggestion is that if we can
predict DNA methylation in a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, then that could potentially
capture the global potentially accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: space across all tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predicting chromatin accessibility and
DNA methylation directly from sequence can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a number of different benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a sequence-based model
quickly queried to highlight functional
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and rank of yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be similar to a verb score and
really serve to narrow down to those top X
[SPEAKER_00]: variants based on effect size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second important point is that if we
get good cross-species models,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'd be able to predict regulatory
regions in species that we haven't done
[SPEAKER_00]: these assays in and we only have genome
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could save time and money by
avoiding these relatively expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that these accessible
regions are expected to be enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor binding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we might use that as a signal to
separate accessible from inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it's a very noisy
signal because we observed that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of spurious matches to transcription
factor binding sites in inaccessible
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that aren't functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my hypothesis was that maybe it's
really the border relative orientation of
[SPEAKER_00]: these motifs that it serves as a stronger
signal to help different state accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: from inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also know is that these
transcription factor binding domains have
[SPEAKER_00]: been served across long evolutionary time
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we find one piece in one
species, we expect them to be observable
[SPEAKER_00]: also in other species as well for
transcription factor binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so provisional neural networks have
already been shown to be able to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin state from sequence within
species, at least in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see at the bottom is BHC,
which is a pre-standard provisional neural
[SPEAKER_00]: network, which is one of the first applied
to try and predict this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a range of about 80 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just think of it as a metric for
classification performance, from zero to
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a year after that, DanQ was
released, which is a recurrent provisional
[SPEAKER_00]: neural network, which shows improvement
across almost all of the test bases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chromatin states and the tissues that
they've tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question was, can we then use
DanQ to predict chromatin accessibility
[SPEAKER_00]: across species?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data that I used to train the model
with ATAC-C data, which basically causes
[SPEAKER_00]: repiles underneath accessible regions of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take what's known as a
peak color to then binarize this output
[SPEAKER_00]: and get binary accessible sequence and
accessible sequence regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take what's known as UMRs,
which you do methylation sequencing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome and you get methylation state for
all three contexts of DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, if it's absent in all three
contexts, that's unethylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then again, I have binary
unethylated and methylated region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in total, I have trained data from
about 12 different species for ATAC-C,
[SPEAKER_00]: spread nice and evenly across the
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the UMR, I know about 10 species,
five of which are from the original
[SPEAKER_00]: GRASSES paper and five of which were newly
called for this work in the DIPOC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: of how I'm going to model this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking in 600 base pairs of sequence
and I'm centering it on the UMR or the
[SPEAKER_00]: ATAC-C peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's shorter than that,
I'll extend symmetrically from the
[SPEAKER_00]: midpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll feed it into DanQ, which is that
recurrent convolution neural network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll attempt to predict zero or one,
inaccessible or accessible, methylated or
[SPEAKER_00]: unethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in comparing, can this
model, we know it works within species in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, but can it do as well across
species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Within species it hasn't observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for now, I'm going to shorthand call
this model A to Z for rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does training A to Z look like for
a within species model?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you want to do it within a
rabidopsis that way on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a holdout
chromosome as a test set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to assign these open and
closed unethylated methylated bins on that
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome for that test set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll assign the rest of the training set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to down-sample my training
set to make sure they're equal across open
[SPEAKER_00]: and closed, because this is known to
improve classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that down-sampling is done,
my training set looks like this in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26,000 observations per species with
accessibility and about 36,000 for
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to evaluate the model on
the test set with something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: For accessibility, we get an A to Z of
about 0.6 in rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for methylation, a little bit slightly
better at 0.65.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for across species, we're going to
choose a test species as our test set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take all of those
within the test species as our test set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then assign the rest of the species
into the training set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to down-sample our training
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to train the model and
evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we get a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does my within species rabidopsis
model do to the across species model that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't seen rabidopsis sequence at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look across both of these
features, you see within accessibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does almost equally as well within
species as the across species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less so in case for methylation,
but still very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the results across both
features and all my species in my data
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's very encouraging is that,
at least in accessibility, we see a very
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive comparison between the across
species and the within species models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either equal to or greater than the
ability of the within species model,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within methylation, this is not as strong,
but it's still there across all the
[SPEAKER_01]: species that I've sent before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to look at is whether
or not or how large the effect size is of
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way I can do this is by using a
method called global importance analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that works is I'll sample a bunch
of random background sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, I did 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used the base care frequency and
accessible readings across to sample
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I do is I embed a Jasper
motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: The database is about 530 plant TFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just ask the question, what's the
difference in prediction?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this for all 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a pairwise differences and I
average that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I embed the motif at all possible
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take the maximum of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my maximum global importance
score for a given TF, any given species,
[SPEAKER_00]: any given chromatin state accessibility
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can rank these TFs by that value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a table that looks something like
on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to notice is that on
accessibility between Arabidopsis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Maze, we don't see a similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see the TCP motifs in Arabidopsis
are highly ranked for accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in Maze that it's also TCP is
highly ranked in the top 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also means dot type motifs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the methylation side of things,
it's more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see basically the EP2-ERF motifs are
highly ranked consistently between both
[SPEAKER_00]: species, as well as these BDR-BBQ family
motifs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, I've shown that these
recurrent neural maps can model chromatin
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility and DNA methylation from
sequence and across species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These across species models are
competitive to models trained only within
[SPEAKER_00]: species, or basically in the NDS firms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the TCP family motifs we saw rank
highly in global importance to the across
[SPEAKER_00]: species accessibility models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the methylation models,
it was EP2-ERF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also happy to report that there is
a preprint available that shows what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed here and also more on BioRFET.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've uploaded the data of the model to
Zanetta, which are linked to the preprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's code on GitHub, which includes
instructions for making your own
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions in your favorite species,
if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I'd like to acknowledge,
like me, Eddie and Eric for their guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: on the co-authors for all the work they
helped in making this paper happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called those extra die-cot,
unlike with the regions forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of talk about all their
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funding sources are
high-performance computing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, I ask, do you have better ADP
on our endopsis and rice compared to maize
[SPEAKER_00]: and the species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this mean that genome complexity is
playing a role?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do notice a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as genome size increases, my
performance increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this boils down to is that the
model, I often show that it makes more
[SPEAKER_00]: false positive mistakes than it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by false positive is the
model calls it open, but the data is
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in these larger genomes,
that effect is a lot more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get less of an active genome
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of reasons why I think
this is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the Atax C in the angiosperms was
called very conservatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a potential that the models
calling things are actually open in vivo,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just weren't able to be captured in
the conserved P calling for the
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a number of other
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a sense of how additive these
motif effects tend to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be fairly additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's been shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's more important, though,
actually, is that these have been shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: be additive to an extent that they can
interact with each other at the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's more important is that they're
shown to be redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start deleting these motifs,
it doesn't necessarily mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: expression would be infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also important.

Thank you.
