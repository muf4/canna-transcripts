[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the very nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quick seminar overview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm first going to talk about disease
resistance breeding in the Cornell Great
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm going to talk about three topics
that made up my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is using computer vision to
detect or quantify downy mildew and leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: chycones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next part will be to integrate genetic
information SNPs, in this case,
[SPEAKER_03]: with multiple phenotypes in something
called a Bayesian network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, I'll talk about accounting
for spatial effects in field data with
[SPEAKER_03]: grapevines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just an overview of grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're perennial, clonally propagated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two main groups that we work
with, vitus munifera, which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: European grapevine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's susceptible to virtually every
disease, but it has very good wine
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, as well as certain table grape
attributes that we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other group is various vitus
species that are native to North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these species are resistant to
nearly every disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they have really poor wine
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, sometimes we do want their table
grape characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the goal of the program is to merge
the best of both worlds to obtain hybrids
[SPEAKER_03]: that have a high disease resistance,
as well as high wine quality or table
[SPEAKER_03]: grape resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how grape breeding works in the coronal
process we terminate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have certain markers for traits,
such as disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then those seedlings are transplanted into
the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: After years of multi-location,
multi-year trials evaluating for field
[SPEAKER_03]: disease resistance, as well as wine
quality, the best of those selections are
[SPEAKER_03]: released as cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first part I'll be talking about is
computer vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is computer vision?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's using algorithms to extract
information from images that's usually
[SPEAKER_03]: extracted using human vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the pros is that this method is
high throughput, you get a lot of data
[SPEAKER_03]: fast, that you could obtain quantitative
phenotypes, and that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: high-level programming libraries that are
available in order to implement these
[SPEAKER_03]: algorithms.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the one I used is called
OpenCV or Open Computer Vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some negatives with this method is that
it's time-consuming to develop,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it requires technical knowledge from
the end users, which the phytopathologists
[SPEAKER_03]: or breeders in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little about down in the middle,
this is how it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left-hand side is the back seal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the side of the leaf, and this is
where the oh my seed infects through a
[SPEAKER_03]: stomata, and you obtain sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, for a vitus minifera,
you need to spray about every two weeks if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a really rainy year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's commonly thought that this
kind of intensive pesticide application is
[SPEAKER_03]: no longer sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'll talk about the genetic resources
that I've used to evaluate this method.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is, or both of them are
interspecific F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is vitus rupestris bihorizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So vitus rupestris is a Native American
vitus species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And horizon is an interspecific cross that
has vitus minifera in its background,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as other vitus species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for both of these, we have genetic
maps available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's about 6,000 SNPs, and the
population size is 160.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll call this family RH.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other family is horizon by vitus
scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, vitus scenario is a wild vitus
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's special about this family is
that it has the back seal leaf chaikongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two images of leaf discs per
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: The left-hand one is prior to inoculation,
and on the right-hand side is the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: disc that what it looks like, the same
leaf disc after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could see both of them,
the sporulation on both, but it's much
[SPEAKER_03]: harder to see on the leaf disc when it has
leaf chaikongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because the leaf chaikongs are
white and the sporulation is white,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's difficult to differentiate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the idea that I'll use is using the
computer vision rating prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculation as a covariate to control for
the leaf chaikongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the particular assay that we use is
a leaf disc assay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, we took leaf discs from the
field, made leaf discs, and plated them on
[SPEAKER_03]: an auger dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the leaf discs correspond to
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experimental design, here it's for the
RH family.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have controls, and we did this over two
years, 2015 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2015, we had three experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2016, we had two.
[SPEAKER_03]: For each experiment, there was a time
series collection of data from three DPI,
[SPEAKER_03]: or days post inoculation to six DPI,
or sometimes it was four DPI to seven DPI
[SPEAKER_03]: if we didn't see sporulation after the
DPI.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we collected four leaves from each
genotype and from each leaf we extracted
[SPEAKER_03]: two leaf discs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for each experiment, we had about 1,400
leaf discs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the only difference between the RH
family and the HC family experimental
[SPEAKER_03]: design is that in 2015, we only had two
experiments for the HC family,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was just due to lack of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we compared the computer vision rating
with a manual rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one to five scale where one is no
sporulation, and five is dense
[SPEAKER_03]: sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how we did the computer vision with the
algorithm did is that you have this input
[SPEAKER_03]: image, and what we want to do is remove
the background, the auger from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as detect the leaf discs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this requires some user input of
parameters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next thing that we want to do
is if you notice on the second row of the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf discs, there's greater illumination
than in the first row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had to correct for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody called a Wallace filter,
which I won't go into, but essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: normalizes the illumination across an
image.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we could detect the or phenotype,
which in this case is the amount of white
[SPEAKER_03]: pixels in a leaf disc divided by the area
of a leaf disc.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'll go into the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'll just explain one experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here is the computer vision ratings on
the left hand side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this cyan color is three days post
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could see it's very close to
zero, as you would expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then four days we get kind of the
distribution moves up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you get further along in the days
post inoculation, the distribution keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's relatively normally distributed.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, compare this to the manual
sporulation ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see at 3 DPI, it's skewed all
the way to the one rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you get further along, it skews
towards the five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the ratings here are the average of
eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaf discs for a particular genotype,
for an experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are all the other distributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see that the trend is
similar across experiments, where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively normally distributed in the
computer vision ratings, but very skewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the manual sporulation ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the correlations between the
methods, we see that the correlations are
[SPEAKER_03]: very high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this shows that our computer vision
method is accurate in obtaining a good
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see when we average across
genotypes, the correlation increases,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what we would expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now going on to the computer,
for the HC family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this family had leaf trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the computer vision ratings were
the ratings after accounting for the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome computer vision ratings,
which were simply the computer vision
[SPEAKER_03]: ratings at two days post inoculation,
prior to any sporulation on the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: discs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could see that it's not as
clear in the computer vision
[SPEAKER_03]: distributions, that there is a general
trend of increasing percent sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's not as clearly defined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for example, in the first experiment,
at seven days post inoculation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it kind of moves down instead of being
close to five and six, which are the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: and purple in the first graph.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, for the manual sporulation
ratings are again skewed, or in the case
[SPEAKER_03]: of the first experiment, it's just
uniformly distributed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the correlations, they were
much lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Averaging across genotypes helped increase
the correlations a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not by a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for one experiment, all the days post
inoculation correlations weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly different than zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is, we didn't get
a good rating of, essentially the computer
[SPEAKER_03]: vision rating didn't do a good job in
obtaining the leaf trichome, a true
[SPEAKER_03]: rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the use of the covariate didn't
really work in that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one way to improve it would be to
standardize illumination to maybe improve
[SPEAKER_03]: obtaining that leaf trichome rating to use
as a covariate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a summary looking at the rating of
processing times over 1,400 leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: The manual visual rating took three hours,
while the computer vision method took 20
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a great improvement in how much
you could phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want more information about
this, the phytopathology paper is out for
[SPEAKER_03]: this research, and all the code is on my
GitHub in the link shown below.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some future directions in this
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a comment by Martin the last time
I gave this talk about how if you see that
[SPEAKER_03]: because of this parameter search,
you need to set parameters where you
[SPEAKER_03]: detect all the leaflets at the same time,
which is relatively easy to do for the RH
[SPEAKER_03]: family, but there are problems with it for
the HC family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still get the detected circles that
are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this method that's recently been
published, ELSDC, played around with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and seems like a good way to remove this
parameter search.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another direction to go into is to
generalize phenotype detection.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in my case, I'm detecting
white pixels over what if the disease was
[SPEAKER_03]: red.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could model the pixels as coming
from particular clusters, then it could
[SPEAKER_03]: generalize this method.
[SPEAKER_03]: So reviewing the phenotypes we obtained
for these two families, we have the manual
[SPEAKER_03]: and computer vision sporulation ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, I'll just talk about the
manual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sporulation ratings because of the kind of
problems we've had in the HC family with
[SPEAKER_03]: these ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also, as I mentioned, collected the
leaf trichome ratings at two days post
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also collected hypersensitive
response or RH ratings, which were
[SPEAKER_03]: collected two days post inoculation before
any sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, the rating scale is the
detection of black dots, which represent
[SPEAKER_03]: necrosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a rating of five has dense necrosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the questions is, what phenotype
should we use for QTL detection?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have eight ratings per genotype per
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how we integrate this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is with a mixed model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our response in this case is the
average of eight ratings, our fixed
[SPEAKER_03]: effects, the intercept, the experiments
within years, and the leaf trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the leaf trichome ratings only for the
computer vision ratings for the HC family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have a random effect of the
reading value or the genotypes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which here we assume that all the
genotypes are independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we include a genotype by year effects,
again, assuming that the years are
independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we fit this using MREBEL, which is an
R package.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the simplest QTL detection is just
using a single phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll use the term phenotype,
but I'm really going to use the reading
[SPEAKER_03]: value as the response variable in this
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the basic idea is you scan the genetic
map for significant SNPs, and you include
[SPEAKER_03]: them in your model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you keep doing this until no more SNPs
are significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, this equation where you
end up with a particular phenotype equals
[SPEAKER_03]: an intercept plus SNP1 multiplied by the
effect of SNP1 plus SNP33 multiplied by
[SPEAKER_03]: the effect of SNP33 plus the error term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the SNPs are fixed effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did this with our QTL, again,
an R package.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one issue with this stuff is that the
QTL are often not robust when you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: small population size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, we only have 160
individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say you remove 10% or 10%, you might
end up with different QTL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want ideally a method that provides
robust QTL because we're going to invest a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of effort in using them for marker
assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to essentially understand how
phenotypes affect phenotypes or how SNPs
[SPEAKER_03]: affect multiple phenotypes, one thing we
could do is adjust that prior method and
[SPEAKER_03]: simply scan for the most significant SNP
or phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could end up with a model
that's some phenotype one is the response
[SPEAKER_03]: and is explained by phenotype two.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, so in order to do this,
we need to be sure that we include effects
[SPEAKER_03]: that only kind of make sense, make
biological or mechanistic sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if we have leaf tricones
equal or being affected by sporulation in
[SPEAKER_03]: this case, that doesn't make sense because
leaf tricones were present on the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that model will not make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we wouldn't consider it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so an effective way to do that
multiple phenotype analysis is by using
[SPEAKER_03]: something known as Bayesian networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you're doing here is you're
adding effects in something called a
[SPEAKER_03]: greedy manner until an additional longer
increases the network's Bayesian
[SPEAKER_03]: information criterion or BIC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll explain a few terms in that
sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is what is a network?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's multiple separate linear models,
one per phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these will just only be fixed effect
linear models.
[SPEAKER_03]: The BIC is the likelihood of a particular
model subtracted by a penalization term,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a function of the possible
population size and the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters in that model.
[SPEAKER_03]: The network's BIC is simply a sum of the
individual models, individual model BICs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And greedy addition means the addition of
an effect to a particular model that
[SPEAKER_03]: increases the network's BIC the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the reason they're called Bayesian
networks is simply because we're using the
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayesian information criterion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'll give an example of how this is
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So assume we have two phenotypes,
sporulation and HR or hypersensitive
[SPEAKER_03]: response and two SNPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these orange arrows represent all
possible effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So immediately we'll not attempt to
account for the effect of sporulation on
[SPEAKER_03]: HR because HR appears prior to
sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do not allow phenotypes to affect
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we essentially go one by one with
these effects and ask which one increases
[SPEAKER_03]: the network's BIC the greatest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a hypothetical example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the SNP2 affects it the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do this again, estimating every
effect and asking which one increased the
[SPEAKER_03]: BIC the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's this one in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we come up to a point where no
addition of any of these arrows increases
[SPEAKER_03]: the BIC of the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're left with the two models
which this network represents,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that sporulation is affected by
HR, which is this arrow, and SNP2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And HR is affected by SNP2 only.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so SNP2 has a clear show effect
affecting both sporulation and HR.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this method is too computationally
intensive to do with thousands of SNPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we select a non-redundant set of SNPs
for each phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the name of that set is called the
Markov blanket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have one Markov blanket for each
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we construct 1,000 networks using
random sets of 90% of the genotypes used
[SPEAKER_03]: for both RH and HC families.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we merge all the networks in one
where we only keep the effects that
[SPEAKER_03]: appeared in at least 50% of the networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do this with the BM learn package
in R.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the results for the RH family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could simply represent any linear
model in this network representation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just do that for the single
phenotype QTL analysis results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the difference only here is that
the phenotypes will not affect each other
[SPEAKER_03]: in the single phenotype analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we see in the BAC network is that
there is no effect of HR on sporulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the only possible phenotype
interaction that I allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the SNPs generally found are in
the same chromosome, so QTL are similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the main difference is that in
the single phenotype QTL analysis,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sporulation trade had many more QTL
found for it than in the BAC network.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit more interesting in
the HC family where we found that these
[SPEAKER_03]: typhoons have a negative effect,
this red arrow, on sporulation and HR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And HR had a positive effect on
sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't know why this is the case,
but for the leaf chycone, negative effects
[SPEAKER_03]: on the disease phenotypes, it's
hypothesized that it forms a physical
[SPEAKER_03]: barrier between the spores of the oomycese
and the stomata on the abaxial side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would prevent spores from
germinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the single phenotype QTL
analysis, it's somewhat uninformative
[SPEAKER_03]: because all the phenotypes were explained
by the same two QTL in chromosomes 5 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 8.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, you know, what's
really going on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the BAC network kind of explains that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, the QTL are similar,
and you could see that 7 effect on
[SPEAKER_03]: sporulation is found here, and the QTL on
chromosome 6 effect on HR is also found.
[SPEAKER_03]: To summarize this, the disease resistance
in the two families is controlled by
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple QTL, and they only account for a
small percent of the phenotypic variants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That breeding for leaf trichomes,
as well as other QTL, could possibly lead
[SPEAKER_03]: to durable resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, because you have that physiological
type of, physiological barrier mechanism
[SPEAKER_03]: and, say, a mechanism that's biochemical,
where there's, say, necrosis occurring to
[SPEAKER_03]: stop infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: BAC networks are one way to integrate
multiple phenotypes with genetic data,
[SPEAKER_03]: as we've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one question is, are BAC networks
better models?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to do this, we would need to
perform cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't done that formally,
but preliminary data experiments do
[SPEAKER_03]: suggest that BAC networks are better than
just using single phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'll move on to accounting for
spatial effects in vineyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, we commonly phenotype
in the field, as opposed to in the lab,
[SPEAKER_03]: as the previous methods did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's commonly done in unreplicated
vineyards, although not in all cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some assumptions one can make is that
the phenotypes that we measure are the
[SPEAKER_03]: best representation of the breeding
values.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another assumption is that the phenotypes
are corrupted by a complex function of
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, microclimate, and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is likely the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the problem with this is that we
really don't have the data to fit this
[SPEAKER_03]: model, because we do not have
meter-by-meter soil data in our vineyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one could use the location of the vines
as a proxy for that effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's essentially what we're going
to do here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, again, going to use a mixed model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, the response would be, corrupted
phenotypes, or what I'll call corrupted
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypes, which is simply the phenotypes
that are measured in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be explained by some
spatial effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the noise will be our uncorrupted
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the spatial effects will be
controlled by this L matrix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhat similar to a genetic
relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of this matrix being a function of
snips, it's going to be a function of the
[SPEAKER_03]: location of the vines in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a number of ways you can
encode this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll just talk about two.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is called a moving average covariance
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is an autoregressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're commonly used in time series
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to explain these models, I'll have a
really simplified example where I have
[SPEAKER_03]: four vines in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to see what covariances
these various models give.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the simplest one is called a moving
average one model, where you're only
[SPEAKER_03]: modeling the covariance between adjacent
vines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see the encoding of the L
matrix here, where this A, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: value between 0 and 1, is the covariance
between the first and second vines and
[SPEAKER_03]: goes down the diagonal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this can be represented here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a moving average two model is a little
more complex, where neighboring vines are
[SPEAKER_03]: explained by A plus A times B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, B is a value between 0 and 1 that
we're going to optimize for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the covariance between the first and
third vines is a value of B.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a corresponding covariance
matrix.
[SPEAKER_03]: An autoregressive one is simply saying
that there's an exponential decline or an
[SPEAKER_03]: exponential decay of covariance as you go
further along.
[SPEAKER_03]: So neighboring vines have covariance of A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then between the first and third is A
squared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And between the first and fourth is A
cubed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because A is between 0 and 1,
as you go further along, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have covariances closer to 0.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you have an autoregressive two,
which is a little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, the easiest way to think of
it is combining two autoregressive one
[SPEAKER_03]: covariances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, you have this B.
[SPEAKER_03]: A parameter now.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you set B equal to 0,
it's going to revert back to an AR1
[SPEAKER_03]: covariance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here, this L1 is simply this value,
and L0 is 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the covariances are related to the
previous covariances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to evaluate how well these models
perform, I have a data set, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, an F1 interspecific cross similar
to the previous crosses I've explained.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are six rows here and 110 vines
within a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only going to model the covariances
within a row because of the small number
[SPEAKER_03]: of rows that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 475 vines that have been put
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the phenotype for powdery mildew
on a 1 to 5 scale in 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 350 of them have genetic data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how I'm going to do this evaluation is
I'm going to fit that mixed model that I
[SPEAKER_03]: explained previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the uncorrupted phenotypes,
I'm going to do a QTL analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm also going to leave 10% out
cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what that means, I'm going to use 90%
of the phenotypes that have genetic data
[SPEAKER_03]: in this model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this model is essentially G-bluff,
which is, again, another mixed model,
[SPEAKER_03]: where similarly how we had that spatial
covariance matrix, we now just have the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic covariance matrix as explained by
Van Raden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we predict the test genotypes
with the parameters estimated from that
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to compute an accuracy
score, which is the Pearson correlation
[SPEAKER_03]: between the predicted and true uncorrupted
or corrupted phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at the results, the spatially
unadjusted and adjusted phenotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: detected the same 3 QTL in the same
locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the genome-wide prediction
results, the accuracies, there was an
[SPEAKER_03]: increase, whether using an MA1 or any
moving average or autoregressive
[SPEAKER_03]: covariance function.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the standard deviations were
quite high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this increase was not statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at how well the covariance matrix
fit the data, an AR1 and an AR2 here fit
[SPEAKER_03]: the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they actually fit the same,
because the AR2 reverted to an AR1 because
[SPEAKER_03]: the B parameter was set to 0 during
optimization of, in this case,
[SPEAKER_03]: the log-marginal likelihood.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what REML optimizes, or what REML
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have two more data sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, I do not have genetic data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just looking at how well the
covariance matrices fit the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, they're both F1 interspecific
crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one has four rows, 76 binds per
row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, only modeling covariances within
rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 300 binds were genotype,
again, for powdery mildew in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second vineyard had three rows,
61 binds within rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 200 binds, second year binds,
were phenotype for height.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these binds were never trimmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could phenotype for height in
this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the results here is that AR2 covariance
functions the best because they had the
[SPEAKER_03]: greatest log-marginal likelihood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to summarize, the 2002 powdery mildew
data set did not show a significant
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit just for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it would be good to have some
more vineyard data where we could look
[SPEAKER_03]: into this, especially one where the
standard deviation isn't so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that their processes usually fit
vineyard data better than moving average
[SPEAKER_03]: processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just going back to our overview of
grapevine breeding, where this research
[SPEAKER_03]: fits in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high throughput phenotyping using
computer vision helps us obtain faster
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypes for our F1 families.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where we get our markers that
we use for marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And accounting for spatial effects could
possibly lead to more representative
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate QTL or ratings in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bayesian networks, for example,
could suggest what phenotypes we should
[SPEAKER_03]: generally breed for if we want disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to acknowledge Bruce Reich for
giving me the independence to conduct the
[SPEAKER_03]: research that interested me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lance Hale-Davidson and Michael Gore for
helping me flesh out my research and for
[SPEAKER_03]: being on my committee, and everyone else
here for helping me out with my research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank my funding sources
by this time, which was funded by the USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: NIFA grant and the Charles R.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullis Plant Hybridization Endowment and
the Michael Nolan Endowment Fund.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask one question, Constantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the work that you did on the
Bayesian network analysis, do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that could have been applied to many past
studies and QTL analyses in vitus,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you see that applicable to most QTL
analyses?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because in most cases, we only had,
or I feel most studies only had one
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think there's a benefit when
there's just a single phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the model will be very similar to
what you get with that single phenotype
[SPEAKER_03]: QTL analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try using multiple rows instead of
just within row?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spatial adjustment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Accounting for the six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said you had multiple rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try combining the information in
those rows in your spatial analysis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it actually decreased.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it wasn't significant just because
of the high standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the issue there is that we
would have to, so I guess I didn't mention
[SPEAKER_03]: this, is that the space between binds
within a row is different than the space
[SPEAKER_03]: between rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to need different A and
B parameters when we fit between row
[SPEAKER_03]: covariances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we only have six binds,
or sorry, because we only have six rows,
[SPEAKER_03]: those parameters are likely not to be
really well estimated, which I feel is
[SPEAKER_03]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How common are those trichomes on various
species that are used or looked at for
[SPEAKER_04]: both mycid and mucous systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so technically, Bitis vinifera has
leaf trichomes, but they're practically
[SPEAKER_03]: not seen as shown in the leafless image.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those really dense leaf trichomes,
they are never present in Bitis vinifera.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're present in certain Bitis species,
like scenario and labrusca, just to name
[SPEAKER_03]: two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there it's the most common.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not all wild species have these
dense leaf trichomes, but just some do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about the trichomes
is that there have been some other studies
[SPEAKER_02]: just on the inheritance of trichomes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of them, some of your
analyses pointed to the inheritance
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns of trichomes and they're also
related to the ecological niche in which
[SPEAKER_02]: certain types of predatory mites exist on
great leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually encourage certain predatory
mites to live on great leaves just by
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding for higher trichome densities,
the dematia densities.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if there's no more questions,
thank you for coming to my seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
