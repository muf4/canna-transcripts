[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to be talking about the
push-pull system, which are in sub-Saharan
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a really interesting
example of ecological intensification as
[SPEAKER_00]: an approach to solving the challenges of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of you know that this really
is my first time being involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: research in a developing country in
small-holder subsistence farming systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've traveled to many countries for
workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what I decided would be really
interesting to become involved in for my
[SPEAKER_00]: sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just speak briefly about
ecological intensification as a framework
[SPEAKER_00]: and an alternative path for addressing
some of the challenges in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: an introduction and a tour of push-pull
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my preliminary research results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research is so far being conducted
on Fulbright funding, which is rather
[SPEAKER_00]: limited for actual data analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some future directions and the
collaborations that have come out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we're facing some big
challenges in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't have to go over them
for this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many solutions that are
being proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can sort of think of them as a
continuum, starting with more crop per
[SPEAKER_00]: drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that we continue on our
current path and improve the efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the resources that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another alternative that's proposed is
ecological intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of restoring ecological
integrity as a way to address some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many sort of a continuum in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in reality, we're going to need to
draw from both of these approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see them as mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm particularly interested in looking
at ecological intensification and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about how far can we push
these approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the central hypothesis of this
approach is that we could use biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: to enhance and restore some of the
ecological processes that support yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and productivity and be able to reduce the
fossil fuel-based inputs that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So address some of these issues of
environmental degradation and also food
[SPEAKER_00]: security at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some evidence that in going in
the trajectory towards intensification and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amazing increases in yields that have
been achieved, that there have been
[SPEAKER_00]: reductions in biodiversity, talking mostly
about plant diversity, which then has
[SPEAKER_00]: these cascading effects on arthropods in
the below ground communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one graph is from the Midwestern U.S.,
the Corn and Soybean Belt, over a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another is some work that was
done in Germany looking at plant diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: on a somewhat smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this trend can be found in many other
landscapes that as you intensify,
[SPEAKER_00]: you increase the tendency towards
monocultures, either continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures or maybe alternating to
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have extensive landscapes in most
places that are actually in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: species or one or two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of intensification was
enabled by replacing ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_00]: that were once delivered by plants,
for example, nitrogen fixation or weed
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as perennials and other species are
removed, we can use fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use herbicides to actually increase
yields even without using that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity for those outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is, can we go in the
opposite direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we increase plant diversity and have
an impact on how much energy, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using it as a proxy for inputs,
on the inputs that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we go in this direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get tangible benefits by managing
plant diversity at multiple scales,
[SPEAKER_00]: so within the field, the farm,
and across landscapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some evidence that links
biodiversity, both in space and time,
[SPEAKER_00]: to improvements in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a few studies that have
actually looked at some energy
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to put up three examples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's in Africa in the same sort of region
where they were looking at biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: both in terms of intercropping and
rotation and its impact on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another study that came out,
it mainly focuses on pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that pollination as an
ecosystem service, and the impact on those
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that require pollinators is probably
the best example and the most studied case
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can link biodiversity across
landscapes and at farm scale to concrete
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits in yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can go in either direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people study landscapes and look at
how homogeneous does a landscape need to
[SPEAKER_00]: become before it impacts yield negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find that you get to landscapes that
have fewer and fewer kinds of species,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have reduced abundance and numbers of
pollinators and reduced yields in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination-dependent crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most recent study,
which was carried out across many regions
[SPEAKER_00]: on multiple continents, found this very
strong relationship between plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity, pollinator diversity and
abundance, and yields and it did vary
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some intricacies in here that
the entomologists care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just suggesting that we need
to understand more about these processes
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at how far can we push it and how
can we use these methods to complicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: to complement the inputs that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly important for
those smallholder systems where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they don't have the resources at
this point to purchase all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been aware of the bush pool
intercropping system for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it in my agroecology course as an
example of where multiple ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms are used to manage pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Zare Khan, who's the scientist
who's been working on the system for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed it along with a number of
collaborators, some at Rothenstedt in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this system was developed by Isipe,
which is a small NGO that's based in Kenya
[SPEAKER_00]: and works in the region of Sub-Saharan
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Isipe is my host institution in Kenya
and Zare Khan is my main collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Kenya straddling the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never been there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to actually start working and
visiting these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isipe is located over in western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red X is right on the shores of Lake
Victoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their second research campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have an office in Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the area where they work is this
region of western Kenya, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-humid tropical climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a lot of variation in the
rainfall that actually occurs there,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere from 800 to 1600 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most locations, it's a bimodal
distribution, so there's two growing
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, very far up north, there's one
long rainy season up near Katali in sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of their northernmost border of the area
they work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are farmers using push-pull
systems in other parts of Kenya and also
[SPEAKER_00]: in other Sub-Saharan countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them are concentrated in that,
let's see if I can go back, in this region
[SPEAKER_00]: of western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the challenges that these
farmers are facing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem borers are a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many different species of
stem borers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget there's more than 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget exactly how many there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the major arthropod pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one is the biggest one that has
the largest impact on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other serious problem is
striaga, which is a parasitic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And striaga, actually, in addition to
taking nutrients and carbon from the maize
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, striaga is pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually injects compounds into the
plant that disrupt its metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stunting of growth that happens,
so here's the striaga that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: attaches right to the maize root,
are largely due to this disruption of
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism and sort of an actual disease
that develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striaga has a huge impact on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just can decimate yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets into a field, it produces
lots of seeds, and it can just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the push-pull system is basically the
idea is to manipulate the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the field and sort of on the
borders of the field, to address these
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints that are impairing yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work began in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, the focus was on the
stem borers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it began with screening a bunch of
especially grass species to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that would serve as trap crops,
so that would attract the pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants that would repel the
arthropods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking for both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's called a push-pull,
is sort of named after the main focus of
[SPEAKER_00]: managing the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea of push-pull systems has
been around before the 1990s, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some work done in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not the only case where this
approach is being used, but it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of an extremely effective case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by accident, Zircon discovered
desmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some seeds for it, and he would
screen whatever plant species he was
[SPEAKER_00]: finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that desmodium not only
had a sort of a repelling effect towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem borers, but it also helped to
control the striaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a huge discovery,
because when they first began promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: the system to farmers as a way of managing
stem borers, it is a somewhat complex
[SPEAKER_00]: system to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to learn how to actually
manage it, and they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have contributed to some of
the innovations, and I'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer said, look, this is great that
it controls stem borer, but if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the striaga, then we'll consider
intercropping and doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a good thing that he found
a plant that could actually effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: control the striaga, because it by far has
a greater impact on yields and is of more
[SPEAKER_00]: concern to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, desmodium is a legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial legume, so it has the
added benefit of fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of improvements
over time to the system from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's now multiple species that can
be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers have pushed some of this
innovation by giving feedback on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a diagram of how the system
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a huge amount of work on
the chemical ecology, the entomology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system, and very little work on the
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the desmodium is planted in between the
maize rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plant their maize fairly far apart,
so they don't have to adjust the spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They normally intercrop food legumes
commonly, so common bean, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or groundnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they plant the desmodium in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, to the arthropod, smells like a
damaged maize plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been like 11 to 13
chemicals that have been identified that
[SPEAKER_00]: mediate these exchanges between the plants
and the arthropods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those act as the repelling plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem borers, when they go out of the
field, find an apiar grass, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: planted as a border around the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trap crop that attracts the stem
borers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lay their eggs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super-duper trap crop because it
actually ends up killing 95% of the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the larva hatch out on an apiar grass
plant, they get stuck in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew that the plant secretes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like some sticky goo that it
secretes near the base of its leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of them end up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it reduces the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the desmodium also releases some
root exudates that stimulate germination
[SPEAKER_00]: of the striaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's a suicide germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The striaga germinates, but it cannot
elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: To connect to the maize roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why can it not elongate its roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't it elongate the seed tube?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the technical name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the chemical that's produced by the
desmodium, for some reason, stimulates to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's not the next step that
allows it to elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about as far as I know because
there are a lot of mechanisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a slide of that, but I left it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main part of the below
ground work that's been done, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: is on the desmodium control of the
striaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the research station.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several long-term experiments
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the maize with the desmodium,
which is quite a vigorous grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's managed in ways that reduce the
competition with the maize in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: timing of cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Napier grass also serves as a forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it's also susceptible
to the striaga, the purple flowers of the
[SPEAKER_00]: striaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's amazing is this is only about
five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's absolutely no striaga in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The desmodium is incredibly effective at
controlling the striaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one thing we're wondering about is
will there be, over time, some adaptation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the striaga to be able to overcome the
desmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, there is no evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to notice the size of this
napier grass, because it's rarely on a
[SPEAKER_00]: farm do you see the grass get to this
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the issues, that the
farmers are harvesting napier grass and
[SPEAKER_00]: the desmodium to feed their livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in the season, so the desmodium
is cut back quite drastically when the
[SPEAKER_00]: maize is planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very small when the plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the maize starts growing,
it begins to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it's much smaller than it
was under the large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time the maize is large,
it can be a very thick carpet and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even grow upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is out in one of the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to notice here's the very
highly harvested border that's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many farmers are over-harvesting these
accessory plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one question that we want to
look at is how much harvesting pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: can these systems bear and still garner
the benefits of the desmodium and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an adjacent field is
another one of this farmer's fields that
[SPEAKER_00]: she hasn't transitioned to push-pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefits have been documented
extensively by work out in farms in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of yield increases, the control of
straggle and stem borer and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of work on soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the conclusions about soil
fertility are sort of anecdotal or
[SPEAKER_00]: indirect and based on yield improvements
and the plants look more vigorous and we
[SPEAKER_00]: know nitrogen fixation is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one area I'm very interested in
trying to actually document.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are significant improvements in
livestock production because now there's
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality fodder for them and also
more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these plants serve as fodder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very important outcome and
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one reason why farmers are interested
in adopting this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, there are some economic
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the yields go up sufficiently so
there's extra maize for selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's work going on now looking at
how this all pans out in terms of human
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, about 96,000 farmers
have adopted the system, mostly in Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenya but also in Uganda, Malawi and
Tanzania, particularly in areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: strike is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some of the areas that are a
little drier where there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ZipA has been instrumental in
disseminating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a demonstration garden at the
farm where they have the system at
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought some of those extension
folks might be interested in this because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a complex system to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can bring farmers there for
intensive trainings and they can show them
[SPEAKER_00]: at this stage you need to do this and at
this stage you need to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when you trim the desmodium and
they can actually get practice doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have irrigation so they have at
least sort of six plots that are at
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages when you would carry out
different management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a whole other sort of system
of educators and materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, beyond their efforts,
farmers have played an incredible role in
[SPEAKER_00]: disseminating this technology,
which is probably important in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is this complex to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most famous farmers is
Sarah Obama, who I met.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were kidding me when they
said they were gonna have me meet Sarah
[SPEAKER_00]: Obama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, oh, they probably have a
grandmother all over the country and they
[SPEAKER_00]: tell Americans you're gonna meet Sarah
Obama.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got there and I saw the sign
and I saw the military guarding her farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was active at one point in some of
the push-pull dissemination efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's pretty low-key right at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you some, I think this
is where, yeah, I want to show you just if
[SPEAKER_00]: the video works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to test it because of all
the technical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna see two farmers and these
two farmers have been instrumental in
[SPEAKER_00]: disseminating the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them organized Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one you're gonna see is
organized groups where they meet
[SPEAKER_00]: periodically, talk about what's working,
talk about what they need to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bounce ideas and problems off of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gonna talk briefly, briefly about
Striga.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next farmer is called the
grandmother of push-pull by many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in the region because she adopted,
a bunch of farmers were invited to this
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was the only one that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the men came.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she got trained in push-pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been training farmers in her
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the push-pull farmers tend to be in
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gonna talk in her own language about
the push-pull and just, but show you two,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's got two fields, a push-pull and a
non-push-pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you have Striga before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was Striga.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be beautiful with the,
I know yellow, pink, pink flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long has the push-pull?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know she is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how much she put on?
[SPEAKER_03]: An amazingly small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so she has had push-pull fields since
1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took out one and sort of, and you
know, rearranged her fields and that field
[SPEAKER_00]: has been push-pull since I think 2004,
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, sometimes they try to do
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She put fertilizer on her push-pull and
she's convinced that that helped her
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, she put like five kilograms on
the whole field.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what we can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the challenge of doing on-farm
work because we suggested, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if you put fertilizer on both of your
fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many, in many, many cases,
we see fields where they are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer on all of their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the field station, they put
fertilizer on push-pull and non-push-pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the Striga is the main,
one of the main issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm working with pretty much all
entomologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in what's going on
with the dysmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of questions about how the
nitrogen is being delivered to the maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two possible pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entomologists are convinced that
this is the important pathway just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that legumes can, you know,
transfer nitrogen to non-legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, I actually think this may
be important early on, but this probably
[SPEAKER_00]: is the major pathway later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that, you know,
nitrogen's gonna contribute to building
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another mechanism for
delivering nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of questions that I
started out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really interested in looking at how
the dysmodium intercrop defects the flows
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen and building organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also looking at some of the other
related benefits of building of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understanding some of the sort of
the ecology of nitrogen fixation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several dysmodium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variation in environment
and also in management history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can understand this,
then we could actually make
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations to the farmers about when
they might need nitrogen fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they may not need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence is that farmers are applying
nitrogen fertilizer sometimes at high
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, mostly at very low rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they're, you know, they're not
really discriminating between their
[SPEAKER_00]: push-pull and their non-push-pull fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may put just as much fertilizer on
the push-pull fields where the legume is
[SPEAKER_00]: when their other fields really might be
nitrogen starved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were seeing some evidence that
adding nitrogen suppresses nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the dysmodium in fields
where they put on a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, we would just find very few
nodules and not, you know, active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some questions about how they use
their land and how much, how heavily they
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest these crops, especially the
dysmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when can they start harvesting it
heavily?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go into some preliminary
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with sampling on the field
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just results from three of
their long-term experiments showing about
[SPEAKER_00]: a 30% increase in soil nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the 20 centimeter depth,
so basically the tillage layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of a surprising finding was this
difference in extractable phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both the push-pull and the
non-push-pull systems, it's a tongue
[SPEAKER_00]: twister, have received the same amount of
phosphorus fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do extractable phosphorus,
there's this significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the push-pull and non-push-pull
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't looked at the fractions and
exactly where the phosphorus is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's something we're very interested
in following up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you look at differences in pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've measured pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got there, there had been
absolutely no soil measurements done,
[SPEAKER_00]: even on the experiment station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH does not show a significant
shift from push-pull to non-push-pull,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for in one experiment, which is the
non-replicated experiment, the oldest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that one, I think it's because some
of the manure they added probably has some
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium carbonate in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very patchy, patchily
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would expect these differences
in the organic matter pools to show up
[SPEAKER_00]: most significantly in the active pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the particular organic matter,
and these are very important to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: because they do have the greatest impact
on soil structure and on nutrient flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly the occluded particular
organic matter could be an important
[SPEAKER_00]: source of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people that like to see this,
so this is from the top five to six
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters, just the difference in the
amount of residue going into these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the longest experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the free particular organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took these pictures for extension
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the occluded particular organic
matter, which this is a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to see differences in these
fractions is just sort of a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a testament to how profound the
impact is of having this perennial legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very interested in collaborating
with them to do some work out on farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how this practice actually affects the
farmer's soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their practices, I mean,
on the field station, we could make a
[SPEAKER_00]: critique.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are optimally managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not aggressively harvesting the
supporting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are harvesting them,
and they are using them for fodder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harvesting them in the recommended
way, which is not nearly as aggressive as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the farmers who have small land
holdings and really need fodder for their
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cluster that I've been focusing on
in this initial work is located near the
[SPEAKER_00]: village of Behiga.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just gives me an idea of the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this area has a rainfall that's sort
of in the higher to medium end of 1,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,200 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is bimodal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this region, farmers have some very
small holdings, fractions of hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the size of the farms varies with the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the farmers in this region have a
tenth of an acre or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the plus side, this is an early
adopting region, meant to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's partly because straw aga was a
very severe problem in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see lots of straw aga in
non-push-pull fields in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fields started between 2002 and
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do this on-farm research,
we took fields and divided them into at
[SPEAKER_00]: least three replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, if it was a large field,
we would divide it in half and then divide
[SPEAKER_00]: those into three replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the design, because there's some
rolling topography and there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in soil types that occur on a
fairly small scale, our first priority was
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to match the soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the analyses will be viewing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use them as pairs in order to
compare push-pull and non-push-pull
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some of the data from the farms,
but not all of the background texture and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went out, divided them into these
replicates, and collected soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: from 20 centimeters, usually in-mate
composite samples, at least six to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: cores, depending on the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We interviewed the farmers briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really dependent on the
extensionists to help me because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers do not speak English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary is one of the exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our findings on the farms are
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar to what we found on the
experiment station.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much more variable, as you would
expect, given the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five out of eight pairs showed an
increase in the soil nitrogen and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, it's reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we hope to do is to look at how
environmental variation and also
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices, so the severity of
the harvesting, how much is being
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested relative to remaining in the
field, and how that impacts these
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found the same result with the
extractable phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do know that in this pair,
because these farmers are neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: that she applied phosphorus fertilizer,
and she did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the others, it is very hard to get
accurate fertilizer information from
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've finally figured out a
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've had better success when I went
back this past June at getting information
[SPEAKER_00]: that we feel more confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we're going with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing I'll show you with
these preliminary results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of the early work to look
at nitrogen fixation dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in the process of trying to find
funding, because it's pretty expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition to do the isotope analyses
that are needed for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did do a survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at the delta n shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the delta n.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it gets to be more positive in the
desmodium, so in the nitrogen fixing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, we can conclude that nitrogen
fixation is being reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a reduced proportion of nitrogen is
coming from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see this positive relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer the farm or the soil is under
push-pull, we know the nitrogen fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would predict that that would
suppress nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legume down regulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see evidence for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty good relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we would assume,
uh-oh, my line's in the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was at zero, that would be 100%
nitrogen fixation, which we don't normally
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that line move?
[SPEAKER_00]: A mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I still have five minutes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk even faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So future directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about the
challenges, because the farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: playing a really essential role in
overcoming some of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the major challenges is access
to the seeds or to the materials for these
[SPEAKER_00]: accessory plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about the napier grass,
the brachylaria grass, which is the other
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, and the desmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, the green desmodium,
which is a more drought-resistant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've had a very difficult time getting
it to produce seeds in the climate in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of a problem that they've
been wrestling with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, again, the farmers have been
playing a crucial role in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Elizabeth Odeer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forgetting her last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she has a nursery for the
brachylaria grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's been propagating this,
and as part of her outreach work,
[SPEAKER_00]: disseminating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the farmers are actually hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They receive a stipend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're given a stipend from a sipe to
perform these roles of outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they occasionally take it further and
actually do problem-solving such as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize the major issue is the farmers
can't get a hold of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to play one more
video of, oh, I'll show you her picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Urka mytho.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her farm is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're watching this video,
you might want to just watch her
[SPEAKER_00]: expression while the extensionist is
translating, because she's barely hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: on to not cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's her farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm at the lower push-pull field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've planted a lot of green
desmodium at the bottom of this field,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has overgrown the brachylaria grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is full of flowers and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took some pictures of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're having some very
successful seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know if it's the material they
started with or something about the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Rachel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so these are desmodium seeds from
her desmodium field.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying to bulk to see if she can get
seeds out of the green desmodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the seeds that she has been
able to harvest from just a small part of
[SPEAKER_02]: her farm where she's trying out this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to harvest more from her
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these ones, she's going to put it to
dry up before she's going to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: extract the seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that was Rachel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the extensionist from Osepe that I
work with most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was also my translator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a lot of the interviewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She engages in the social science research
that they carry out and extension
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So future research directions,
I promise I'll cover it in two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the work that I'm pursuing,
I'm very interested in trying to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: more detailed work on nitrogen cycling in
these systems to try to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: flows and transfer of nitrogen to the
maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also working with some
collaborators to look at some broader
[SPEAKER_00]: questions relating the below ground
changes that take place in Pushful and how
[SPEAKER_00]: those affect the arthropods that are
interacting with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly, Andre Kessler is
interested in how plant secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds might shift and that may impact
these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a group of us that have
been formulating an idea to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the long-term sustainability
in the Pushful systems, because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of questions that come up about the
longevity and how these systems can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to be effective over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of the core collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Katya Poveda and Andre Kessler,
who are the two Cornell faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both entomologists that I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the folks at Osepe, there's
Professor Kahn, who's periodically had
[SPEAKER_00]: appointments at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Charles Modega.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jimmy Pitchar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he carries out the social science
research, so looking at the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: dissemination of knowledge and how this
impacts things like labor demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sort of getting into
collaborating with some nutritionists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're especially concerned about two
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, over time, as you increase the
proportion of the landscape that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems, how will that possibly
impact the herbivores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these arthropods going to become
resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to overuse a mechanism
and they'll adapt?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many questions with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also climate change and how that's
going to impact them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate change issue is tied into
this question about harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much pressure can you put on the
system and have it still function?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those as sort of the key pieces of
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll stop and say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions
or listen to comments you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all rain-fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, there's not a means to
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, they may have water for
irrigation that they'll preferentially put
[SPEAKER_00]: on their home garden, some of the
intensive vegetable crops right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that's an Indian story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a central hypothesis,
is more diversity more likely to get
[SPEAKER_01]: higher yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher yields in what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the central hypothesis is
sort of tied to energy and inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that the diversity is not
any diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a managing diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should reflect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be reflected in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea that just annual diversity
will be good, that's not really the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: view it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hypothesis comes out of the
natural ecosystems or unmanaged ecosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different metrics that we can
use for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so functional diversity and
phylogenetic diversity, those are two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of replacing species
richness, just simple number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I concur with a line that there was
a fascinating presentation both about
[SPEAKER_01]: drink water history and the push-pull
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, have you given any thought
to the applicability of this push-pull
[SPEAKER_01]: system to American or North American
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I asked the entomologists
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from the pest control angle,
and if there's an entomologist here who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to add to this or correct me,
I think that it is probably not an option
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, mainly because of the maize
genetics, the material we have that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's see, the signaling and the
communication between the stem borers and
[SPEAKER_00]: the maize has been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stem borers, from what I can
understand from Katia, the stem borers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States do not recognize the
signal of, hey, I'm a damaged corn plant
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, at least the same.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the specific system, and then there's
other issues with trying to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial in between the maize rows and
how that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have genetic material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're using that's really adapted for
the system that's in place, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: these cascading effects on the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the broader question of using plant
species, I think, is definitely an option
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will want to consider,
even in intensified high-yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some problems that we're running
to, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination-dependent crops, where even
under high-input intensive agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: yields are being impacted by the lack of
diversity in the landscape and the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can't really be overcome just by
moving honeybees around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't seem to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if we want to try to
expand the ecosystem services that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get from agricultural lands,
that this is one approach that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to think about, where do we
really want to use nitrogen fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could be strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's definitely systems where
there's enough rainfall, enough of a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season, to grow some of our
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would accrue these other
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about how do we, I think we
just have to be strategic about how we
[SPEAKER_00]: blend ecology with the inputs that have
been developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two really quick ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the desmodium perennial, is there any
sort of residual inoculation that happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just the native factors that give
residual inoculation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, they haven't really been using
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's because it's
promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some native desmodium species
that are in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually now, so the two they're using
are from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most prevalent, silver and greenleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two desmodium species that are
native of sub-Saharan Africa that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that taking advantage of these
different ecotypes in desmodium and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the different species of grasses that can
fulfill this function is a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually my second question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the diversity of the
desmodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there variation for the amount of down
regulation of natural formation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I'm very interested
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, the green desmodium is being
heavily favored because it's drought
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know enough about the
ecology of these species to know when
[SPEAKER_00]: might be beneficial to have the silver
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the difference in these in terms
of how they perform in an inner crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some farmers are ending up with a mixture,
which I think is probably a good way to
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they've lost some of their silver
desmodium because of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've replanted with green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've left the silver that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that'll be interesting to see
how that pans out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to thank Laurie and Jen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great Christmas.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
