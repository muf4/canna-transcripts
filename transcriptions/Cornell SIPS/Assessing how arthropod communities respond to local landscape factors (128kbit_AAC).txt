[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as my title shows, I'm going to use
this opportunity to sort of look back over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last few years of different research
projects I've been involved in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which we particularly looked at how
arthropod communities respond to different
[SPEAKER_00]: ag management practices, environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the common theme will be community
level response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the factors differ will be the focal
arthropod tax that we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cropping system, and then the
landscape context of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to cover three
different topics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I might move quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to interject if you have any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just about myself real quick,
as Don said in the introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main goal, if I could reduce it down
to one idea, is that my work tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify management practices or other
environmental factors that maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance and diversity of beneficial
arthropods in agro ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if possible, concurrently measure
ecosystem services as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get into the three topics
we're going to look at, I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: point out, again, everything I'll talk
about today is at the community level,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least multiple species systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I think of these, you sort of
have different analytical toolboxes you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pull from to assess communities that
differ than, say, working at the
[SPEAKER_00]: population level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one objective may be to look at
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things I'll present
today might relate to species richness,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we'll present rarefaction curves,
which is sort of a standardized way to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare species accumulation as it rises
with sampling intensity among locations or
[SPEAKER_00]: habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may look at evenness, the relative
abundance of different species within a
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we may combine these two things with
richness and evenness into a single
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity indices, which you've probably
all heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we may use similarity indices if I'm
interested in comparing the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap of species among different
habitats or treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other sort of toolbox I'll pull from
is this idea of community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you work with diversity
measures, you sort of lose that species
[SPEAKER_00]: level resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reducing everything to a number,
per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know how different species
are responding in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I'm going to present results
from different ordination techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can look at how species and
treatments associate with one another by
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying sort of dominant gradients in
the community and then looking at groups
[SPEAKER_00]: of species and how they're responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within that, I'm using primarily
redundancy analysis, which is a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: constrained ordination, where we're
looking at actual how the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: factors in our experimental design relate
to these subsets of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one I'll introduce is
this idea of principal response curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is similar, but it has an added
layer of complexity in that you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: a time component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principal response curve would be
something like a multivariate repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: measures, so how these species respond to
treatment factors at multiple points in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get through all three
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just feel it's interesting to sort
of take a broad look at three different
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I'm going to talk about
are ground beetles, which are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: family Carabidae, in a maize cropping
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the landscape context would be,
then, these ridge and valley physiographic
[SPEAKER_00]: profits in central PA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, we look at a broader
beneficial group of taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the pollinators, predators,
and parasitoids and how they're responding
[SPEAKER_00]: to practices in mid-Atlantic tree fruit,
specifically south central Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is a much different
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at how wild bees respond to
different conditions in community gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout New York City, so an urban
landscape context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's begin with the ground beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each one, I'm going to sort of talk
about those three factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the landscape, you have this
ridge and valley region here, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of have these long parallel forested
slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the valleys, there are these
ag-dominated valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so depending on where your farm may
be, you could be in the center part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: valley in an agricultural matrix,
or it's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon to be on the edge of the
valley bordering directly adjacent to
[SPEAKER_00]: forested areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that comes into play in part of our
research as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focal taxa for this group will be
members of the family Carabidae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are a very diverse group of beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard of them before,
there's about 40,000 species worldwide,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 2,000 in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very popular with
entomologists, because they seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: good bioindicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can use them to test the effects
of different management practices and what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also provide us with many great
ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people go throughout their whole
lives never looking at these small little
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles near their feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet they're providing us with wonderful
services, such as pest predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming more widely known for
their predation of weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some estimates are that for all the
seed removal from a system, 40% can be
[SPEAKER_00]: attributed to just these beetles alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cropping system, or the
context of the study, is going to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with this introduction of transgenes into
agroecosystems in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done several studies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on one that's looking
at transgenic maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is corn rootworm protected,
which is a beetle pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this BT maize expresses a cry 3 toxin
that's supposed to be directly targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: this beetle pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our basic question coming into it
was introducing this new pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it potentially affect non-target
beetles that are beneficial and live in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same area?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of studies work on these non-target
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often they try to isolate the effect
of the transgene in its product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a slightly different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to refer to as a systems
approach, a real-world approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this cry 3 BT maize comes
coupled with other seed management
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies, including neonicotinoid seed
treatments, which could potentially also
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively affect these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed a set of tiered studies
assessing the effects of BT maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our field work was preceded by laboratory
toxicology work, where we tested the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the cry proteins, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long story short, they seem to have no
effect on the beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fed many different species of crabbed
beetles large amounts of BT corn pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: for hundreds of days in a petri dish in a
drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they survived just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different story with the seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when presented with seedlings with a
neonicotinoid seed treatment, we had new
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly 100% mortality of these beetles in
the lab setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there did seem to be a slight
anti-feed-in effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wondered, would we pick up these
effects in the field or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we moved to sort of an
ecotoxicological approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are populations, communities
responding in a field setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of one of the studies
we worked on that we called the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotoxicology of transgenic maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would have these randomized
complete block designs in which we would
[SPEAKER_00]: pitfall trap for beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most commonly used trapping
technique for these epigel or soil surface
[SPEAKER_00]: dwelling arthropods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a sunken cup on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that crawls along falls in,
and we collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The treatment factorial we used was based
on genetics and then on conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of the factorial would
be whether it was the BT corn or its
[SPEAKER_00]: nearest genetic isoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, the BT is inherently
coupled with the neonicotinoid seed so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a coupled technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to differentiate among
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, any effects we see in the field
we were attributing then to the
[SPEAKER_00]: neonicotinoid based on the laboratory
toxicological work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of the factorial then is
whether there is a soil insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applied at planting, a pyrethroid that's a
conventional management for corn rootworm
[SPEAKER_00]: in non-rotated field corn versus not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get these four different designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, isoline on manage would be
our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pest management practice at all
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isoline manage would be sort of a
conventional management with that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT on manage would simulate a grower who
decided to adopt the BT technology with
[SPEAKER_00]: the neonicotinoid to control corn
rootworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one I call the double
whammy, the BT with the neonicotinoid seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and the pyrethroid soil
application just to round out the
[SPEAKER_00]: factorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to put these slides in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to be able to read that,
but this is just to impress on you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you decide to do community level work,
the amount of taxonomic investment and
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling effort that goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected over 7,000 beetles,
every single one pinned and identified to
[SPEAKER_00]: species with the help of Robert Davidson
from the Carnegie Museum of Natural
[SPEAKER_00]: History in Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here we found quite a
diverse range of beetles too and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping monoculture of 50 different
species of just one family of beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since the pest management inputs
occurred at the beginning part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: field season at planting, we were
interested in how these communities
[SPEAKER_00]: responded to treatments over time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a case where we decided to use
this principal response curve ordination
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what you're plotting are
what we call the temporal trajectories of
[SPEAKER_00]: community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do a principal response
curve, it has to be in relation to a
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have this little, in case you
haven't seen a principal response curve
[SPEAKER_00]: before, I have this little training slide
as what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the output, the visual output,
would be a control shown as a horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: line with time going left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the temporal trajectories would
be the communities in your different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interpretation for this would be
that treatment A as a community in that
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment overall responds in a negative
fashion on average to the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment B, the communities responding in
a positive fashion, meaning you're finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual species at higher
abundances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these lines are entire
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to look at species
specific data, the principal response
[SPEAKER_00]: curve comes coupled with what are called
species weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have species with a positive
species weight, they tend to follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: principal response.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have a negative species weight,
they act in the opposite fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because inherently, when you study
communities, there's a lot of fuzziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get differential reactions to the
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different species responding
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line represents the overall trend at
the community level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now what did we find from our
ecotox study?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see the two groups from
left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the horizontal line where you see
those darkened circles, that's our
[SPEAKER_00]: control, the ISO, unmanaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other three you can see
pretty closely follow one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you see where those large dark
arrows are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our pest management inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a decline in all three communities
for the three treatments over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by a rebound later in the season
that may be due to immigrants coming in or
[SPEAKER_00]: later emerging species, or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're concluding from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that even with the
transgenic technology, that neonitrinoate
[SPEAKER_00]: C treatment also has a deleterious effect
on the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get this same response no
matter which treatment we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that not all of these
transgenic crops come coupled,
[SPEAKER_00]: though, with these seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did do another study that I'll just
say what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was more of a diversified farm
setting where we had sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: potato squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared transgenic systems versus
conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: No control plot, but just using grower
standards, we managed the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we documented pesticide inputs and
looked at community-level response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, like this diversified
farm setting, what we found is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: isoline, the non-transgenic plots,
actually required more insecticide inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: due to lack of control of the focal pest
taxa that the transgene controlled for in
[SPEAKER_00]: the transgenic plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, these little blue squares
you see here, these are species
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you increase the number of
individuals you've collected, you increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In almost all instances, we had slightly
higher species richness actually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic systems due to what we believe
were fewer insecticide inputs just due to
[SPEAKER_00]: effective control, because these did not
contain that seed treatment that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting these epigel polyoptera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, though, we found that we
really just weren't finding any
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between transgenic systems
versus conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to do an additional study
to consider, well, what about position in
[SPEAKER_00]: the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that affect the ground beetle
community?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're in this ridge and valley
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our work so far had been done and
sort of surrounded by an agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet there were all these farms that were
directly adjacent to the forested area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we performed one more study where we
looked at the effect of these field
[SPEAKER_00]: margins were in your growing maze next to
this continuous forested habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did more pitfall trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set up this transect design at
multiple locations throughout the valley
[SPEAKER_00]: where you had traps extending from
interior forest from left to right,
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a grassy margin typical for
farm vehicles, and then the whole way into
[SPEAKER_00]: the interior part of the maze field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this experimental design allowed us
to approach the data from two different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could sort of group the traps and just
compare between discrete habitats,
[SPEAKER_00]: forest versus grass versus maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of beetles are we finding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could use the transect design to
look at how the community shifts from one
[SPEAKER_00]: location on the transect to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were trying to categorize,
how are these beetles responding to these
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotones in these agricultural landscapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first, at the discrete habitat
level, we just looked at biodiversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it differs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these turned out really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even thought about submitting this to an
ecology textbook or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it really shows why you should use
rarefaction to compare species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a sampling bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had pitfall traps in the corn and the
grass and the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think of the vegetation in the
forest, very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activity density of the beetles is
much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just on average, we caught many
more beetles in the corn, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a much more open environment,
which can bias, then, the number of total
[SPEAKER_00]: species we think are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would just look at the end
points, as far as species richness,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, rarefaction allows you to go back
to a standardized number of individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say around 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found significant differences
between the forest and the corn community,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the forest was much more diverse than
the corn, based on species accumulation
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, with dominance distribution or
evenness, you can see the forest on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most abundant species just represented
maybe 12% of the total number of beetles
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the corn and the grass,
you get these highly skewed dominance
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Pallas pensylvanicus, a good species,
a weed seed predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can see nearly 60% of all the
beetles caught were one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get these really skewed dominance
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the grass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, we're concluding that the
forest represents a much more diverse and
[SPEAKER_00]: stable community embedded in these
agricultural landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, what about using the transect to
look to a spatial type analysis from one
[SPEAKER_00]: trap location to the next?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided we really like that
principal response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you remember that that's supposed
to be used for temporal trajectories,
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought, can we sort of trick the
program and just do it in a spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: context?
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these dots from left to right
represents a position on the transect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we said our interior forest one is
sort of the baseline community of crabids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be there if we didn't impose
agricultural fields on the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we considered that our control,
and we really took the species by sample
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix from that location and just
replicated it multiple times in our data
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compared the crabid
communities found at each location of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transect back to the interior forest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these represents the relative
dissimilarity with the interior forest
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we put it in a principal response
curve, and we get this nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, as you approach the forest grass
ecotone, the crabid community is
[SPEAKER_00]: inevitably being influenced by the
neighboring habitat, and it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: become more dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as you cross into a new
habitat, you get this drastic decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again here, as you approach this next
ecotone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found, obviously, a significant
difference in the crabid community between
[SPEAKER_00]: forest and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of our objectives
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the crabids perceive this ecotone as a
hard edge, or is it highly permeable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from this, we would conclude that
it was a hard edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this very quick, rapid turnover in
community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the species weights,
the positives follow the principal
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these we could identify then as forest
specialists, because they follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become less abundant as you move from
left to right across the transect.
[SPEAKER_00]: These we would identify as corn
specialists, because they would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: increase abundance as you come into this
area here, into the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's not the whole story,
because when we plotted population
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions, despite that quick
turnover, we were able to identify several
[SPEAKER_00]: species that seemed to be ecotone
specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just anecdotally, we noted from
collecting in other maize fields in the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural matrix that we seemed to be
getting some different beetles at this
[SPEAKER_00]: forest adjacent location.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particularly, Pterostegus digicus,
Psychotraculis furtivus, Peasilus
[SPEAKER_00]: lucublandus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these were at much higher
abundances, or weren't even present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ag matrix location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we plotted their distribution,
they seemed to be going readily from
[SPEAKER_00]: forest to corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our last question was, can we
document that there's a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the communities in maize
adjacent to forest than those embedded in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural matrix?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we sort of pulled data from all
kinds of different studies all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the blue circles might
represent locations that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow are locations we sampled from
forest adjacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically did pairwise similarity
calculations, which are rooted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of shared species versus the number
of unique species in each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we looked for similarity
between ag matrix and forest adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, we found that similarity was
17% to 53% lower than similarity between
[SPEAKER_00]: just different ag matrix locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were concluding is that the
Karabit community in these forest adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: locations were distinctly different than
those within the agricultural matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first study, what are some key
findings?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the local level, we were again looking
at the introduction of these transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that both conventional and
seed-based pest management tactics seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to similarly influence Karabits on these
northeastern small farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we attributed that to the effect of
that seed treatment, which may have
[SPEAKER_00]: deleterious effects on these
ground-dwelling beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could detect this in the field
setting, just as we detected it in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: setting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neonics, obviously, being more in the news
now with potential effects to bees as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the landscape level, we found that
Karabit communities in forested areas are
[SPEAKER_00]: more diverse, exhibit high levels of
complementarity, meaning dissimilarity
[SPEAKER_00]: with neighboring ag land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is evidence that you should
try to retain these forest fragments in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural landscapes, because the beta
diversity will be much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of species turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some species that
readily move across that ecotone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they seem to increase and influence
communities in adjacent maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next question would be
interesting to see is if this affects,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, ecosystem services, based on your
position in the landscape and proximity to
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, second study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, we look at a much wider range of
beneficial taxa, because we're including
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators, predators, parasitoids,
and tree fruit growing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been lucky to get involved in a
lot of different systems with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm partial to this one,
because it's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually from Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, which is in South Central
[SPEAKER_00]: PA, and Adams County, which is a huge
fruit growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have these nice sort of rolling
hills or mountains, and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive to fruit tree production,
because you put the orchards on these
[SPEAKER_00]: slopes, and the cold air is able to sink
down in the valley to prevent,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, frost damage on the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very good growing conditions for
apples, peaches, cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fruit trees are notorious for having a
very complex arthropod taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have a wider range of
beneficials, a wider range of pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's a very interesting system from
a management standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were looking at, again,
predators, like you see on the left here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows ladybird beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their larvae are also very effective
predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at lacewing larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like little alligators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minute pirate bugs, anthocoridae,
spiders, and even the larvae of surfeit
[SPEAKER_00]: flies, those little hoverflies that mimic
bees, very good predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the community of parasitoids,
members of the family Ichnomonidae,
[SPEAKER_00]: Braconidae, Chalcid wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also looked at bees,
so anything from bumblebees to green
[SPEAKER_00]: metallic bees, all kinds of different
bees, which we found many of in these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is part of a collaboration
that's ongoing that I work with people
[SPEAKER_00]: from Penn State, from the Fruit Research
Extension Center, especially Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: Bittinger, who does a lot of work down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what we do, again,
is in that ecotoxicology realm where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at how arthropod communities
respond to pest management practices in
[SPEAKER_00]: tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work I'm going to present today
came out of this program within the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: RAMP funding program, the Risk Avoidance
and Mitigation Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially we're comparing
conventional pest management practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: these newer reduced risk tactics that
growers are starting to adopt as a result
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Food Quality Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Food Quality Protection Act
suggested phasing out these
[SPEAKER_00]: organophosphates and carbanates,
which can be toxic to humans and workers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reduced risk are supposed to be
safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're comparing, does that
translate into elevated numbers of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial arthropod attacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you switch to these new programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this system, throughout Adams
County, we relied on working with local
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allowed us to establish research
plots, which were sort of paired blocks of
[SPEAKER_00]: understandard management or reduced risk
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reduced risk might include the use of
pheromones to disrupt mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be neonicotinoids,
because they're considered lower mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity, a wide range of different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the standard plots were mainly
managed with the organophosphates,
[SPEAKER_00]: carbanates, and pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to look at the response
of the beneficial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for predators and parasitoids,
we used a bug vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entomologists get to use these cool things
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leaf blower with an inverted
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just basically got all the insects
off the tree as we walk around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bees, we used pan traps,
which you may be familiar with are
[SPEAKER_00]: basically colored bowls, blue and yellow
and white, highly attractive to bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a little soapy water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks the surface tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's able to catch bees that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different sampling methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the beneficial
community here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about differences in pest
management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we used the systems-based sort of
real-world approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Bittinger acted as the scout and the
guide as far as pesticide inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kept track of what the different
growers used for the different needs and
[SPEAKER_00]: the different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, what I want to point out here
is the drastic reduction from 95% to 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: in organophosphates and carbanates when
you compare the standard versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of the reduced risk inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing I want to
highlight, just total pounds of active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adopting reduced risk technologies,
you reduce per acre five and a half pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a real drastic change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the environmental impact quotient
for the different insecticides provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell New York IPM program, where you
can sort of get this general idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impact, because it includes
the idea of persistence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, effects to mammals,
fish, arthropods, pollinators,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an 83% reduction in this idea
of environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did this translate into more beneficial
arthropods in our tree fruit systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a different story, depending on
which group we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one of those redundancy analyses
where we could look at, do the communities
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to different treatment variables?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to draw your attention to
are these darkened squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ramp would be the reduced risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the standard is obviously the
conventional management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all these vectors
represent all the different beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: groups within predators and parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general trend here is very stark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're all trending towards
the reduced risk plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a significant effect of
treatment, such that the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beneficial community were found in
higher abundances in the reduced risk
[SPEAKER_00]: fields as opposed to the conventional
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these oddballs over here are
actually pest species, which seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: uncorrelated, so equal abundances,
regardless of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, you have braconid, wasps,
ichneumontid wasps, green lacewing
[SPEAKER_00]: predators, minute pirate bugs,
ladybird beetles, assassin bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: great names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spiders, all much higher in the reduced
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the pollinators, or the wild
bees we looked at, we actually got a
[SPEAKER_00]: different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see, you look at these
axes, you have standard versus ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both clustered right near the
center of the by-plot, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very low effect size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found no effect of pest management
program on wild bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these triangles you see all
around the perimeter here, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just the grower names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we got widely divergent
communities depending on location in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape, as shown by the different
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, so again, no effect of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for example, Pippinapus prunosa,
you may recognize as the squash bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected that near this Harner
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He must have been near some agricultural
fields with a lot of cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason I can think of to
catch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have other things like seratina,
osmia, which require sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: structurally complex environment because
they're cavity nesters in wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the dive lead may have been located
next to a forest edge or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something we're actually
pursuing right now is looking at landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors for wild bee diversity within
orchard systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is sort of anecdotal evidence
or suggests that the landscape is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: driving bee diversity in our orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to drive home the difference
between treatment and site location,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, these are those rarefaction curves,
species accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing bee diversity between reduced
risk and standard, they overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No difference in diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look across site
locations, you get wildly different things
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the number of bees collected to
the number of species found even at
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's going on at the landscape
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some conclusions from the RAMP,
the reduced risk study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trends associated with adoption of
reduced risk tactics were established in
[SPEAKER_00]: this Agnolo paper from which researchers
at Cornell were also involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a multi-state study up the
eastern seaboard looking at what it means
[SPEAKER_00]: to adopt reduced risk pesticides or pest
management programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, they lower the insecticide load.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lessen environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are more expensive on
average to implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our study was sort of a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with the beneficial
arthropod community?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does seem that reduced risk tactics
support beneficial arthropods,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially those providing biological
control, not necessarily the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to address this idea of being more
expensive, one question we have is
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly over time with the establishment
of these biological control services,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to offset some of those
added costs of adopting those
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build a real strong biological control
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually, if you're interested in
this, it looks cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just published a paper in Journal
of Economic Entomology that describes this
[SPEAKER_00]: RAMP study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since the theme of my talk is
sort of this local versus landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to summarize that, predators and
parasitoids responded strongly to local
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that's because they have
limited mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have strong associations
with what they're feeding on or what their
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts are for the parasitoids that are
found in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have incentive to stay local.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bees are operating on a different
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence of this was a recent paper
showing that you can actually predict bee
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in orchards based on the percent
of forested area at 1,000 meter radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bees obviously have greater dispersal
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout their lifetime,
they're relying on multiple feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their nesting resources are often going to
be outside the orchard as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might just be coming into the orchard
during bloom period for resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one, I'll transition to
an urban setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, when I came to LIU, I knew I
wanted to do something maybe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community garden setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was starting to get interested in
bees and bee diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we were looking at community
gardens and how they support wild bee
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in a heavily urbanized
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban is sort of used loosely in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is a very metropolis with heavily
urbanized settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the New York City gardens, you see a
lot of raised bed, although not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have some row cropping and communal
sort of gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you get situations like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 700 community gardens in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's growing, the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put together, that represents a large
portion of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the surrounding
landscape, almost 70% of it is impervious
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as resources for bee is,
they could be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people growing food in the city,
just like anybody else, can benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: insect-derived ecosystem services,
whether it be biological control or
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I focused on bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a study by Kevin Madison and Gail
Longiletto found that of the commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: grown crops there, over 90% benefit from
bee pollination services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not totally rely on, but at least
benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the group we studied were wild bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bumblebee here, although there are
five different families you might collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used, again, different trapping methods
to see what was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a bumblebee visiting of
Budlaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the study was relatively
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had these three basic research
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with some undergraduate
students at LIU on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was, what bees are found in
Brooklyn, New York community gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because something that I tried and
collected include in all these studies is
[SPEAKER_00]: species-level identification to establish
baseline information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we want to answer these bigger
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put the cart before the horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, to some of these very common
systems, we're finding new species still
[SPEAKER_00]: to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing I try to always do
is work with taxonomists, get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This baseline information could be used in
the future to see how communities change,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, in response to climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these historical data are very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question was, does bee
diversity differ among community gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout Brooklyn, New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like a simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought it could be possible that
due to the severeness of the landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: the severity of the landscape,
that you just have a small group of
[SPEAKER_00]: generalist species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what you do in your garden,
you get the same small group of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But assuming we did find a difference,
our third question was then, can we build
[SPEAKER_00]: a simple model just describing what
environmental factors best explain
[SPEAKER_00]: variation of bee diversity among gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we included both local variables and
landscape variables and had them both
[SPEAKER_00]: included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we established research sites
throughout Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me a little sad because it's
just a single slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Megan can attest, this is a huge
project because you have to procure keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't carry all your nets and
equipment always on the subway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're driving and trying to find
parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a huge headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compared to Megan's work, which you may
be familiar with, this was a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, again, because I was typically
working with just one other student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had sites that were spatially
distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to include sites that
approached land use in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, your community garden may be
the size of a single home plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it burned down 50 years ago and they
put in a community garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, like East New York Farms here,
is about the size of a half of a city
[SPEAKER_00]: block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So size, land use, place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to include a wide range of
different variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bee sampling, the best part, why you
become an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled the bees bi-weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the pan traps again, which is a
passive technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just attracted to those bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also wanted to use net
sampling where we actively scouted for
[SPEAKER_00]: bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to cover the whole extent of
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, everything identified to
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received a lot of help from John Asher
at the Museum of Natural History,
[SPEAKER_00]: although he's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he identified a lot of bees,
rest, and verified them all to species
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then while we're doing the collecting,
while we're in the gardens, we
[SPEAKER_00]: concurrently also measured environmental
factors that can be used as predictors in
[SPEAKER_00]: the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept it relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the local level, we looked at the
size of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at percent area and the
different land uses, cropping areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-crop areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used plant diversity, which was
just measured as total species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had people, say from the Brooklyn
Botanical Garden, come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd walk around and just identify as many
plants as we could at each location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then light availability, which was we
used this hemispheric photography,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was introduced to me via Megan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light availability isn't something you
maybe consider that much in other
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an urban setting, especially New
York, which is such a vertical city,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can have huge effects on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a tall building right next to
your garden, it could be cast in shade for
[SPEAKER_00]: half the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hemispheric photography allowed
you to get a picture from horizon to
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain software that you
import the pictures, and it calculates the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light intensity over the course
of the whole growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the landscape level, again,
we kept it relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our garden like you have here in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at two different radii,
200 meters, 500 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just calculated total amount of
green space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We broke it up into two canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be like street trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then open green areas, which we simply
called grass seed areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through the results
just based on the three research
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was what bees are found
in Brooklyn gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through our two years of sampling,
we collected over 1,600 bees, found 50
[SPEAKER_00]: different species, including one that had
never been found in Brooklyn before.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18% of the 50 species were exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically nine species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, I think, around 20 to 22
non-native species of bees catalogued in
[SPEAKER_00]: North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found nearly half of them in our New
York City gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trend was documented also by Kevin
Madison, who did a similar bee study in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just such an interesting
example of how human modified landscapes
[SPEAKER_00]: affect community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are a lot of bees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar, there are almost
20,000 species of bees globally,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than species of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are not social,
like honey bees, which most people think
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're solitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them nest in the soil,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go outside the city,
the majority of species you find would
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be solitary soil nesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an inverse community structure in
the city, and that most are cavity nesters
[SPEAKER_00]: just because there's not a lot of
available soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, about 70% of New York is
impervious soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here are the different bees,
a wide range from bombus impatiens as your
[SPEAKER_00]: eastern bumblebee, peepinapis perunosa as
a squash bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a range of generalists,
some ag specialists, and just a wide range
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question, does bee diversity
vary among gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we were a little unsure
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resounding answer is that yes,
it does, greatly so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the top part of this table,
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two years' worth of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a garden that we collected for
two years biweekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All summer long, we collected 18 bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one, we collected nearly 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drastic differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species richness, one garden, only seven
different species of bees, another 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at the garden
characteristics, we felt pretty confident
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could build some type of model to
explain this, because the gardens also
[SPEAKER_00]: varied widely from very small to very
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant diversity ranged from about 50 to
over 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 species, some of these places I would
call hyperdiverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the gardeners planted at many
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light availability, widely divergent,
and then even landscape context had some
[SPEAKER_00]: variability as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for question three, are there
environmental predictors of bee diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a multiple regression approach
with forward selection just to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest number of variables that best
explain the different bee diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at abundance,
species richness, and then we used a
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity index for the bees as our
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for bee abundance, that's just
total number of bees regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could accurately predict that using
light availability and plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include the coefficients here so you can
sort of think about what that relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every additional plant species,
you gain a bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a coefficient of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the diversity measures get
more complex, so do the models of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know about bee richness,
the total number of different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, plant species richness and light
availability are important, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: get this factor in with the landscape
context as well, which makes sense if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have food rich, a lot of light
availability, you might get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of bees, but you may not get a
wide diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas bringing in the surrounding
landscape context, if you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: green space, you have many different
nesting resources, alternative food
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just might catch a larger number
of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the diversity index, again,
those same three and also garden areas
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be a predictor for diversity,
which includes both richness and evenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe more ecological niche space for
the bees allows them to be a bit more even
[SPEAKER_00]: in that context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were some of the conclusions?
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity and community structure of
the community was definitely influenced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the urban setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that, we found lower species richness
than you might elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, our research in tree fruit
again, you have a pretty standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found well over 100 species of bees
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this urban setting really lowers the
species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the fewer number of soil
nesting species and a high number of
[SPEAKER_00]: exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gardens vary greatly in bee diversity
and land use patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there's the opportunity there for
gardens to augment more bees by changing
[SPEAKER_00]: some practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that bee diversity could be
strongly predicted by local factors such
[SPEAKER_00]: as floral diversity and light
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some extent, landscape context
plays a role as those were included in the
[SPEAKER_00]: models for bee richness and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one result I didn't share,
but again, we employed those similarity
[SPEAKER_00]: indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of data out there on bees in
the city parks, like Central Park and
[SPEAKER_00]: Prospect Park from John Asher at the
Museum of Natural History.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some similarity indices to
compare what we were finding in community
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens to city parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found substantial amounts of
dissimilarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that's driven because the
plant diversity is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these ag species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several bees that are
specialists of certain ag species,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the squash bee, Pippinapus
prunosa, the sunflower bee, Melisodes
[SPEAKER_00]: agilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with these new resources,
without those community gardens there,
[SPEAKER_00]: those bee species would probably not be
present in New York City at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reason to support community gardens and
put more of them in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wanted to use the opportunity,
since I did go through three different,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different systems, just some
overall closing thoughts from doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: community level work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is, despite the fact that I
mentioned that there's lower species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness in these settings, it was still
surprising the amount of diversity we did
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started the work in the maze
ecosystems on the transgenic maze,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody commented that, why would you
want to study diversity out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a barren landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found over 50 species of beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should view these managed landscapes
as a place to conserve biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's increasing evidence that
cities can even host a large amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also think community level
work's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that investment into taxonomy is
important to establish baseline data as we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a rapidly and changing environments,
again, due to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or urbanization's going to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural production's going to expand
with the growing human population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much out there we just don't
even know about insect diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to get these baseline data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, we're in the middle of a
taxonomic bottleneck where we have fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: and fewer taxonomists that can actually
identify these little critters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second broader point, these
ecotoxicological studies reveal that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes species respond differently than
other species in the community to these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we believe, especially I've had
this conversation with Dave Bittinger,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there needs to be a role for these
realistic systems-based community level
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, field studies, in risk
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in registering pesticides and
things like that, the EPA might use
[SPEAKER_00]: honeybee as a surrogate for all
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that we get widely different
responses to different things among
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that you have to have a
realistic approach because you can't test
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we believe these community level
studies, if you can invest the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, could serve to augment those
normal practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also increasing evidence
coming out with bees of synergisms between
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and fungicides, even adjuvants
like oils or adhesives that can affect
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really don't pick that up because
you can't do every single combination in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick that up, though, in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really going on in these different
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is that the relative
influence of the surrounding landscape in
[SPEAKER_00]: any given system varies based on the
ecological needs and dispersal of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: taxonomic group you're working with or
guild you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the bees were responding at a
much larger scale than the predators and
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids in our tree fruit systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the tree fruit, again, we're working
with funding from the Specialty Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Initiative, USDA, on looking at
those landscape factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also getting from NRCS some seed mixes of
pollinator habitat to establish next to
[SPEAKER_00]: orchards and see if you can get things,
food resources for before and after apple
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom, per se, to support pollinators in
these landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm visiting from Long Island
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: My appointment is primarily teaching
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I presented here really
wouldn't be possible without working with
[SPEAKER_00]: really wonderful collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows me to stay active in the
research realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Long Island University, I've worked
with several great students who I've sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of converted into ecologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State University's Shelby Fleischer
was my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Bittinger I work a lot with on these
tree fruit crab collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just his practical knowledge of those
systems is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Mullen, toxicologist at Penn State,
and Neelandra Joshi was a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm here is from working with
Megan Gregory, who I met in the gardens in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also doing research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously want to thank all the growers
and community gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the taxonomists.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this can't be done without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really relied heavily on John Asher and
then Bob Davidson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this work was funded by several
different resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you found that interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entomologist in the horticulture
department here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can try to answer any questions if
you have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if there are any students that are
soon to graduate and considering different
[SPEAKER_00]: job opportunities, sometimes when I've
given past seminars, they like to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that, working at a place like LIU or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
