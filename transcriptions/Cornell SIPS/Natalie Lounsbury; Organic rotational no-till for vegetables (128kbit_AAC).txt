[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Natalie Longfray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grad student at the University of
New Hampshire right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to present some material
that I did for my master's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Maryland, some stuff we're
working on at UNH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it has been funded by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also wanted to do a little shameless
self promotion while I have a captive
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want more information,
on the stuff I'm talking about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go to no-till-veggies.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also just released the first
four episodes of a podcast that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: result of a SARE partnership grant that I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love it if you would check it
out, tell everybody about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My final report is due at the end of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first four episodes are all about
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but today I'm going to talk about
organic rotational no-till for vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a little different than the title
that I initially submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's appropriate that this is the
Northeast Cover Crop Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first project I'm going to talk about
took place in Maryland, looking at forage
[SPEAKER_00]: radish, and then going into spring
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Ray Weil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the current project is in New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Maine, mostly the data I'm going to
present is from Maine, actually from my
[SPEAKER_00]: family's farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned it into a little experiment
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is with Rich Smith at UNH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question, how can we create the
optimal conditions for crop growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include soil moisture, nutrient
availability, weeds, and temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at the same time, conserving and
improving soil, reducing erosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's especially hard in vegetable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one thing that's coming across
in all the vegetable talks, it's that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable systems are really complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does it a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of a glimpse of some
options that you can try, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has to put it all together in
their own unique way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to that last point, how can we do
it to meet the different scales of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable producers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a different favorite piece
of equipment, a different budget they're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing standardized about
vegetable production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more and more, we're seeing small
growers entering the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while they may not cover a large
land base, they're a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: population in terms of providing people
with a living, providing fresh produce to
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can cover crops facilitate no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a slide to show that not only
can cover crops do a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things, everything that they do is
interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately, we care about crop
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get to crop growth, we have to be
thinking about how does the cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: affect nitrogen availability, soil,
water, weeds, those things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just connects to everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four R's of nutrient management,
I think, are very applicable to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pick the right product,
the right time, the right place,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the right rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for spring crops, we're thinking about
soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be warm enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's talked about that,
which means that we can't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil cover because that's just going to
keep the soil cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want enough soil water, but our problem
in spring tends to be too much water,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the climate is variable,
so we do get these dry springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, historically, in the
spring, the problem is too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get on the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need enough nitrogen early in
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's related to soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, in every cropping system,
we can't have too many weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this very unique cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become popular in the last 10,
15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks in vegetable production systems hate
on the radish a little bit because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: another brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're growing a lot of
brassicas, people are really hesitant to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce the radish cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can manage to fit it into your
rotation, it has some amazing properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the SARE project that I worked on for
my masters was using low-residue
[SPEAKER_00]: winter-killed cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked for others that would do the
same thing that forage radish does,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there just isn't one out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after winter kills, it leaves,
if you had a good stand and you got it in
[SPEAKER_00]: early enough, basically zero weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely weed-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody sprayed paraquat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all these little radish
carcasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, very low residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil warms up nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a no-till planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a regular matermack planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in and direct seed no-till into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a matermack planter,
you can go in and direct seed no-till with
[SPEAKER_00]: an earthway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do occasionally have to pick out the
dried radish carcass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work quite as well as if you
have a larger seeder, but it can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important because you can't get on
the field when it's too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested in looking at,
all right, well, how much does radish
[SPEAKER_00]: affect soil moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had forage radish, oats, a radish-oat
mixture, and then no cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this line here is 80% of the
plastic limit, which is sort of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you can get on the field
without destroying your soil if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: within below 80% of the plastic limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the rain events.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that with the oat cover
crop, which is high residue, and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: winter kills, there are very few points in
this span of time when you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: get on the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at it in terms of the workable
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with oats, they're very small windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: With radish, it's as good as if you had no
cover crops, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people use the argument,
well, I don't want to plant a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: because I need the soil to be dry in
spring, well, you can plant a radish and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be just as dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you'll probably get better
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have better subsoil moisture
than if you didn't have a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, we need the temperature to
be high enough so that we'll get some
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization going on so that your seeds
can germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forage radish in red is almost the
same as no cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that oats, as you would
expect, higher residue, keeps the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that translate to nitrogen
availability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the bottom here, we've got Julian
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that's basically March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cumulative degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the top, we've got soil
nitrate nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the top 20 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you see is that with the
radish and the radish and oat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you kind of hit this critical level
when you get increasing degree days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a spike in the available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when your plants are going to
start growing and you need the nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting mineralized from the radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not happening with the oat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not happening when you don't
have a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a significant boost in
nitrogen early.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, you want to take advantage
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to wait for it to reach
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up being about 40 to 50 pounds
of nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a no-till spinach crop right
after radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really quickly yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four site years total.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Clarksville site up here was in the
Piedmont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice soil, not to abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Y soil is a coastal plain soil,
silt loam, and it's rather abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yields at Clarksville tend to be a
lot higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just as good in the no-till
as in the tilled plots, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people would be surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did not see that at Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because the soil at the
Y, I would say, is kind of addicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those soils that can't produce
a good crop without tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't have the soil structure
needed to support a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that people ask a lot when I
talk about radishes is, what about the
[SPEAKER_00]: holes?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're direct seeding, don't you lose
a lot of seeds into the holes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, seeds can come up in the
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is that no-till planting
led to equal or better emergence as
[SPEAKER_00]: planting after tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with tillage, you eliminate those
holes, but you don't get as good
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get as good emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, the holes don't seem to limit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you do need to have good
enough soil to support the crop growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all vegetable crops do well in this
no-till situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that some take a little longer to
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some lettuce and kohlrabi,
and they were just slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did mature a couple of weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're eager to get that crop out
of the field, then it might not be as good
[SPEAKER_00]: an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some carrots in Maine, some no-till
carrots after radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that they did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were not quite as good,
but I think that was just because we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, in this case, got lower
emergence and had reduced stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, this system relies on
seeding your cover crop around mid to late
[SPEAKER_00]: August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cover crop grows in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cover crop dies over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much the whole Northeast region,
your cover crop forage radish will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow a cash crop, make some
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow another crop or another
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the spring early system where
you're looking for low residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: more soil warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get rid of the excess water so
you don't want your fields to be too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for summer crops though, again,
you definitely don't want weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's actually not as important for the
soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important for the soil temperature
to be high, but you want the soil cover
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want it to retain the moisture
when you're getting into the summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need that mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But high residue systems like the roller
crimper that discussed a lot in grain
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and discussed a lot in
Pennsylvania and Maryland and those
[SPEAKER_00]: places, it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you folks went to
Stephen's talk today, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see that you just can't get
the kind of biomass in Northern climates
[SPEAKER_00]: that they talk about in Pennsylvania and
Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it no matter how hard we try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get adequate weed suppression in
those high residue systems, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need almost four tons of dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the data, I love looking at
other people's presentations and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: nope, nope, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost nobody gets that amount of dry
matter in their cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a much more realistic number for us
in the Northeast is about half of that for
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty good cover crop performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be hard to terminate,
especially if you're growing rye with
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch or something and you get asynchrony
between when those crops mature and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to wait until a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really these high residue systems sound
great, but we need a lot more flexibility
[SPEAKER_00]: if people are going to adopt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to terminate the cover
crops more easily and we need some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental weed control because we just
aren't going to get the biomass that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about tarps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tarps have been promoted in the market
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of small farmers are using them in
the context of permanent raised beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as we knew, there weren't a
whole lot of people who were combining,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we didn't know of really anybody
who was combining high residue cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and tarps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were these folks in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I couldn't, I don't speak
French, so I couldn't, I think they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have had something about their experiment,
but I couldn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did find this picture online of what
they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did though, we had an initial
preliminary trial two years ago and we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried black and clear tarps and what we
learned was clear doesn't really work in
[SPEAKER_00]: our climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we modified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this past season, what we did was
we seeded Ryan vetch end of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's not a date when you're going
to get very high biomass, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really realistic date for farmers in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mid August, even though I would
advocate that for forage radish is not
[SPEAKER_00]: very realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of September is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biomass that we got in these two
fields and my farm was about 4,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: between 3,500 and 4,500 kilogram per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around two tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the treatments we applied on June 5th
were rolled with a disengaged rototiller
[SPEAKER_00]: and tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we, that is because we also
do not have a roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mowed with a sickle bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mower and tarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to borrow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mow to the sickle bar mower
and we didn't tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally we tilled and tarped and
we tilled and didn't tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looked like when we
mowed with the sickle bar mower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard because it was a push
one BCS and it was hard to get the residue
[SPEAKER_00]: to lay flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of shook off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did the best I could, but it was a
little messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just four mil UV stabilized black
plastic held down with sod staples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the three different sort
of residue management looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tilled treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that most farmers would never
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not really your ideal tilled
treatment, but your ideal tilled
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, you would have killed your
cover crop way earlier and incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to deal with high biomass
cover crops if you're working in a tilled
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the mowed one looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rolled looked like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had two fields kind of next to each
other, but a little different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left the tarps on for four weeks,
basically the whole month of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on July 5th, we transplanted the
cabbages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, again, we don't have any
fancy no till transplanting equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was actually use a tree
seedling dibbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stand up and you make a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really laborious, but when you
have undergrads, it doesn't take too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually don't think it took that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do this again, we will measure
how long it takes so we can do an
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise budget of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it ended up looking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a mowed and tarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tilled and not tarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did have subplots of weeded
and not weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here in the mowed and tarped,
you can't see a huge difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeded and not weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with the tilled and not tarped,
there's a pretty substantial difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the weeded and not weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like these fields were
weed-free or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a substantial weed seed bank,
a substantial weed problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rolled and tarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that middle flag there is marking
weeded and unweeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowed and not tarped, which is one of
those treatments that no farmer in her
[SPEAKER_00]: right mind would ever do, but we're
researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the not weeded part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the weeded part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up harvesting a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small cabbages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tiara cabbage from Johnny's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're intended to be a two to three
pound head, kind of a high density
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a severe porcupine infestation,
which we kept at bay with a 22,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were like, we got to get our data
out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were really beautiful cabbages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do say so myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three are the tarped treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red is weeded, blue is not weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a huge difference between weeded and
not weeded where we had a tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our tilled treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we didn't have a tarp and we tilled,
an enormous difference between weeded and
[SPEAKER_00]: not weeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not using a tarp,
you really have to control your weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what most farmers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You control your weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, mow no tarp, just kind of a
joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reminder, the average cover crop
biomass was 35 to 4,500 kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where there was no tarp, substantially
more weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just for the un-weeded plots,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both fields, pretty similar story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there was lower biomass,
there was a little bit more of a weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: more weed even in the tarp plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tarp plots, it was mostly pigweed
and purslane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And research has shown that tarping or
solarization does not really affect
[SPEAKER_00]: pigweed and purslane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very, very high temperature
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there still weren't a ton of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't looked at the moisture and
temperature data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we hypothesize that warmer
temperatures during tarping increase
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're solving some of that problem of
cool soils in spring by having a tarp on
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a little while and getting
everything going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Katie just showed me a graph from an
on-farm experiment that one of her
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating farmers was working on,
who actually had a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a substantial three degree
difference, three to five degree
[SPEAKER_00]: difference under the tarp, which is what
you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also hypothesize that more water
available in the no-till plots is good for
[SPEAKER_00]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less stress during dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, this rotation looks like,
all right, we plant our cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow a little bit in the fall,
not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mostly grow in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tarp them for around the month of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know four weeks works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to do some more experiments to
see whether we can get away with a shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: tarp duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project was pretty much unfunded,
but we just put in an application and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully we'll get funding and we can
answer some more of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow your cash crop and then move
into whatever's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of a proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like about this system,
even though I hate plastic and I hate
[SPEAKER_00]: being like, yeah, plastic, it provides so
much flexibility because it kills the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop, which is often a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It suppresses weed and it warms the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like solving so many of the
problems that we have in these reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't just have to be Ryan Vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, for instance, a winter-killed
oat cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could put the tarp on earlier
and get stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know, but I think there's
many possibilities for applying this
[SPEAKER_00]: system to other time periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want it to be during a period when
there's some heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get that warming under
the tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way forward, I think I said in the
description, I was going to talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to integrate all these systems,
which sounded like a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I was putting this together
last night, I was like, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the way forward is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that when we have multiple
systems where we can eliminate tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: events, farmers will get creative and
string those multiple systems together so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can eliminate multiple tillage
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with this whole system is
that cover crops do take time to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the opportunity cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this tarping system also takes a
significant amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the opportunity cost of a
four-week tarping period?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the opportunity cost is the tarp is
going to be used in May or June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we really do want to drill
down on how long do you have to put that
[SPEAKER_00]: tarp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the beginning of June,
can you leave it on for a week and get
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the same effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you really have to have it for four
weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to look at anything that has to
do with timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard because there are so many
confounding factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it how moist the soil was when you put
it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've tried to design an experiment for
the future where we can really get at some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see if we get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing was we salvaged enough
of the cabbage from the porcupines for our
[SPEAKER_00]: data that we also donated about 3,000
pounds of cabbage to the food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was awesome, felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's it.
Thank you, Natalie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few questions for Natalie.
Thanks for listening to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then actually next 30 minutes,
yeah, next 30 minutes we have a
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The letter, Ralph, people want to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of questions in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I guess first question for
Natalie.
[SPEAKER_01]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed communities were definitely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed communities in the tarps were
really not diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really like pigweed and purse lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tarp selected for resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't measure the weed density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only measured the weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't definitively say, but I think
from having looked at it, that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: lower density in the tarp plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I didn't mention that,
but that is a really important part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that weed seed destruction,
you need enough moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, you'd put on the tarps after
rain when you're soils are at field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, or if it is dry, you could
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're above field capacity,
they'll drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and put the tarps on when it's
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you put the tarps on when
it's dry, there's also no moisture going
[SPEAKER_00]: into that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go to transplant your crops,
there's not going to be much moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put the tarp on at field
capacity, your soil will still be at field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity when you transplant those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're basically guaranteeing that
you've got good moisture when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
