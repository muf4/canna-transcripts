[SPEAKER_00]: Planting your garden is probably one of
the most important parts of developing a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to grow is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brainstorm with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What foods do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: It fosters a culture of learning at all
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone doesn't learn the same way,
so we have to honor that, respect that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go into a community and plant the
garden around those principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're using physical soil,
but you also have this community soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: also has to be taken care of and
continuously created and recreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important part of the
garden is ensuring that the food is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the community needs and the food is what
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's our job to make sure that we
provide a design or help them design it or
[SPEAKER_00]: expose them to different designs,
let them choose what design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a garden has to be well designed
to make sure we get the most food out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also something important to see
the organization of a community garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is something that a
facilitator would help a community
[SPEAKER_00]: develop, as in they would help the
community figure out how they want to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up their plots, who wants to plant what,
plant where, actually sit down with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, develop their own rules and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although also if you're in a city or in a
certain county or a town or community,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's already regulations around land
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a facilitator can help a community
understand the rules and regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: around land use, then also help them
design a plot on how they want to plan
[SPEAKER_00]: their garden and organize these types of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is like a facilitation method,
as in you're facilitating a process
[SPEAKER_00]: between a community and also the county
and the city in which it lives in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the structure and design of its
ultimate garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already have a site available,
you use that site and you grow on that
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going into a community where
they want to brainstorm sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: visibility is very important, because you
want to attract diverse people,
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse communities, and again,
you're creating a space for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from each other as well,
so visibility is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to go beyond attracting,
you think about accessibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if a community accesses a certain
space easier than other spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to choose an easier space to
access, because food access is not only
[SPEAKER_00]: just about social access, but it's also
about physical access as well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
