[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Catherine Boer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Dean of the College of Agriculture and
Life Sciences here at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's truly my honor to welcome you all
here this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you very much for joining us for
today's Industrial Hemp Summit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's truly a pleasure for me to welcome
New York State Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: and Markets Commissioner Richard Ball
sitting here on my left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Commissioner Ball has been just a real
champion for our state's agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: industries and for the research that's so
essential for keeping our industries
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive in today's marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also grateful to be joined this
afternoon by Assemblywoman Donna Lopardo,
[SPEAKER_02]: also here at the front table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And earlier this morning, also a champion
for this initiative, Senator Tom O'Mara
[SPEAKER_02]: was with us this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, today's summit is an opportunity for
Cornell experts for experts from other
[SPEAKER_02]: universities here in New York State,
for industry members to share their
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and to share their experience on
industrial hemp's potential impact on the
[SPEAKER_02]: economy here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conversations that we are having today
are intended to help build momentum around
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor Cuomo's vision for expanding
industrial hemp production here in New
[SPEAKER_02]: York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as some of you heard me say this
morning, we do have tremendous potential
[SPEAKER_02]: here in New York State for the production
of industrial hemp, which really has not
[SPEAKER_02]: been grown here for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if efficiently and economically
grown, and emphasis on that, efficiently
[SPEAKER_02]: and economically grown, industrial hemp
could be used to launch a wide range of
[SPEAKER_02]: New York-made goods that could include
things like healthy hemp seed oils,
[SPEAKER_02]: building insulation, animal bedding,
novel medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, because hemp has not been grown
commercially here in our state for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long, a great deal of research and
preparation lies ahead of all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where Cornell University and
our SUNY partners come in, and we have
[SPEAKER_02]: roles to play here.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, our plant breeders have the
knowledge and the experience to advance
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp breeding and to test a range of
varieties for performance here in our
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can help determine the best growing
practices for hemp here in New York and
[SPEAKER_02]: where and when and under what conditions
it will flourish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our college and our SUNY partners are
committed to providing sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement in the lives of people here in
New York State through our research,
[SPEAKER_02]: through our teaching, and through our
outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're particularly pleased to work in
concert specifically with our SUNY
[SPEAKER_02]: partners, our State University of New York
System partners from SUNY Morrisville,
[SPEAKER_02]: the new School of Pharmacy at Binghamton
University, and our Sullivan Community
[SPEAKER_02]: College as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we are committed, we are committed to
exploring New York's capacity to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp profitably and to take
advantage of new markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through such strategies, we can help
facilitate rural economic agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: development throughout our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's summit really is only the
beginning of what I hope will be a very
[SPEAKER_02]: successful venture for our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you again for joining us today to
learn more about this emerging industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we can collectively help it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now for this afternoon,
I would like to introduce our first
[SPEAKER_02]: speaker, and that's New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets
[SPEAKER_02]: Commissioner Richard Ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Commissioner Ball began his career in
agriculture as a farm worker at a
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable farm in Rhode Island when he was
18 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been the owner and the operator of
Schoharie Valley Farms in Schoharie,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York for the last 20 years,
and that is a 200-acre farm that produces
[SPEAKER_02]: a wide range of vegetable crops and small
fruits and greenhouse crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has held a number of very important
positions with agriculture and community
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations, including the New York
State Vegetable Growers Association,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was vice president, and as well with
New York Farm Bureau, board of directors,
[SPEAKER_02]: member of executive committee,
member of audit committee, chairman of
[SPEAKER_02]: labor committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he has served as the commissioner of
the New York State Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture and Markets since 2014,
and I've been truly honored to partner
[SPEAKER_02]: with him on critically important
initiatives that he's launched,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the newly reinvigorated Council on
Hunger and Food Policy to the Milk
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing Advisory Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we collectively strive to ensure that
the commissioner can count on all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: SUNY schools to step up to the plate to
assist the state and our agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please join me in welcoming Commissioner
Richard Bull.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a nice way of saying you got an
overdressed farmer in front of you right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really great to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see the crowd has gotten
kind of energized and a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of interest in this subject,
and thank you so much, Dean.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an awesome discussion this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the lieutenant governor here and
some of your elected representatives and
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a great discussion,
a great summary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at where the industry is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at what we've done so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at our potential, and we looked
at where the opportunities for the state
[SPEAKER_03]: to intersect and help grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're pretty much all on the same
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to kind of summarize that,
I won't talk anymore, but I would direct
[SPEAKER_03]: your attention once again to the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We showed a video this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to show it again because we
have a number of new people and because we
[SPEAKER_03]: like the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you would, direct your attention to
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: For thousands of years, industrial hemp
has been a valuable and versatile crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once a top commodity on American farms,
production was driven out by other
[SPEAKER_04]: emerging industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, the federal government
made it illegal to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recognizing its vast potential,
the federal farm bill allowed states to
[SPEAKER_04]: launch pilot programs for industrial hemp
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 2015, Governor Cuomo announced the
bold plan to put the empire state at the
[SPEAKER_04]: forefront of the country's hemp revival.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the type of legislative action that
Governor Cuomo has led with Albany,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's making a real difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Partnering with SUNY Morrisville,
JD Farms in Madison County harvested New
[SPEAKER_04]: York's first industrial hemp crop in
decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell University wasn't far behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was made possible through Governor
Cuomo's industrial hemp research pilot
[SPEAKER_04]: program, allowing up to 10 permits to grow
and research hemp as an agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We studied nitrogen content in the soil
and we studied seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York is abundant in water,
abundant in arable land.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, this crop made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp research is now expanding across the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think hemp is not only a great
opportunity for diversification on the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground, but it could lead to a lot of
great job and manufacturing opportunities
[SPEAKER_06]: that we've lost sort of to globalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp and marijuana may look similar,
but make no mistake, these plants have a
[SPEAKER_04]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the major thing for people to
realize is that industrial hemp is not
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana, even though it looks like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: THC is the mind-authoring drug in
marijuana, and industrial hemp has very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very low levels of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generations of innovators have pioneered
new markets for this dynamic crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using every part of the plant to drive
growth in vital industries and boost the
[SPEAKER_04]: profitability of the agricultural sector,
today the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: retail market for industrial hemp is
nearly $600 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes a good insulation as well as
wallboard for buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be useful for automobiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Press board and furniture bags and
biodegradable packaging material.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soaps and shampoos, cosmetic products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You shell hemp seeds themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're tasty and they're a great
superfood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, with the support of the state
legislature, Governor Cuomo is taking the
[SPEAKER_04]: program to the next level, removing the
cap on the number of permits for hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting unprecedented exploration of
the crop's viability and encouraging New
[SPEAKER_04]: York's best and brightest to discover and
rediscover hemp's potential.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we have more opportunity to do
research, I think we can just make it a
[SPEAKER_07]: better crop and a more economical crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Across the board, we could bring lots of
industry back to New York State,
[SPEAKER_06]: put a lot of people back to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is really an industrial crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should just regain its rightful place
in the American agricultural landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: The global demand for industrial hemp is
growing and here in New York, the
[SPEAKER_04]: possibilities are endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibilities are endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the words that the Dean
and I like to share with each other quite
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit is collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that a little bit earlier,
but I think when we collaborate and we
[SPEAKER_03]: have our partners here in the room and we
have our partners on the same page,
[SPEAKER_03]: who can be against this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like our chances here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Governor is very much committed to
this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's excited about hemp and we talk about
it on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, I just want to say from the
state standpoint, we're committed to
[SPEAKER_03]: staying with this and doing the things
that we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a vision behind all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very practical side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's summit is, even though we've been
working at this, many of you for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time, certainly many of us at the state
level for a couple of years now,
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up with the ideas and doing the
necessary work to get it over the hump.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more to do and the summit is
really just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lieutenant Governor, when we got done
with our session this morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had a good conversation with a number
of our partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard some needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard some things that needed to be
done in order for us to take those next
[SPEAKER_03]: steps going forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to summarize for you
now some of the deliverables from this
[SPEAKER_03]: morning's session that are underway.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the first legislation,
which was sponsored by my colleague here
[SPEAKER_03]: to the left, helped us get started and
allowed the department to designate some
[SPEAKER_03]: areas attached to research institutions to
begin to do some work on hemp in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've issued the first ever research
permits to private farms and businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And previously, that pilot program was
limited to the research institutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the governor's direction,
we've expanded the pilot to include
[SPEAKER_03]: private entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So six of those private farms and
businesses were issued permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring the total number of hemp research
sites across the state to 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've added 21st Century Hemp and RIT
and Rochester.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've added Cavalero Farms in Goshen,
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, JD Farms in Eaton,
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old Mutt Creek Farm in Hudson,
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Plant Science Labs in Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pre-Process in Ellsberg, New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of other things of note that we
heard from our partners this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, we're going to seek DEA
permit allowing businesses to import seed
[SPEAKER_03]: and establish a seed distribution site for
international imports.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard about the importance of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Importing seed is central to research in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in addition to that, we are seeking a
U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drug Enforcement Agency permit to import
the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the New York State Department of Ag and
Markets will advocate to ease the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements to acquire hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be making the federal efforts as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, we will hold the
permit at the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to announce that we're going to
award $400,000 to Cornell University to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to expand the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard that loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: The researchers at Cornell's Ag Experiment
Station in Geneva are going to explore the
[SPEAKER_03]: best practices for growing varieties,
the best varieties of hemp, the different
[SPEAKER_03]: soil types, the various locations around
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of catching up to do
culturally if we're going to be successful
[SPEAKER_03]: with this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the experiment station will also
assess hemp seed quality for germination
[SPEAKER_03]: and weed contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to establish a hemp technical
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lieutenant governor talked about this,
to support optimal growing and processing
[SPEAKER_03]: of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state will establish a hemp technical
team consisting of our department at Ag
[SPEAKER_03]: and Markets, a liaison there, three
Cornell Cooperative Extension partners,
[SPEAKER_03]: educators in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to stay on the same page as we
go forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to increase our testing
capacity at the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard about that this morning as a
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: The department will apply for a permit to
test industrial hemp for THC, which is an
[SPEAKER_03]: important part of the process,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: This additional lab capacity will help
ensure that New York State hemp seed and
[SPEAKER_03]: other products are accepted in other
states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing will also provide protection to
the department, the growers, the
[SPEAKER_03]: researchers, that the crops meet the
acceptable THC level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to create a working group on
top of the technical team, a working group
[SPEAKER_03]: to stay on the same page again to support
industry development.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will include academic partners,
key industry members, other state agencies
[SPEAKER_03]: to strengthen the hemp industry in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: The working group will help build
relationships, share information on best
[SPEAKER_03]: management practices, regulatory
requirements, and as we go forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: identify the research needs that come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to engage stakeholders in
program development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all partners in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll seek input from farmers,
researchers, industry leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look to revise the pilot program as
we need to, the regulations and the
[SPEAKER_03]: program requirements, and in addition,
we'll propose changes to minimize the
[SPEAKER_03]: oversight of the research done by the
educational institutions as it's
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is clearly a very
important point to make here, advocate for
[SPEAKER_03]: the federal policies to boost the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still restricted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have this cloud hanging over our
head and over this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the governor has an office in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very active.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on the same page with you and with
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have influence with the Congress down
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, at the Department of Agriculture
and at our other agencies in the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: we all have national relationships with
other commissioners, secretaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: and directors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that organization will also advocate,
and we'll work through those channels as
[SPEAKER_03]: well to help advance what we know to be
the right direction to go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I'm encouraged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm encouraged at the national level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm encouraged certainly here at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as you go through this afternoon,
you will see the quality of program,
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality of people involved in here,
and you should be encouraged as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, let me introduce our partner,
Assemblymember Donna Lopardo, who has sent
[SPEAKER_03]: me more emails in the last year than I've
gotten from any other single source,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: She cares a great deal about her people,
her farms, her agriculture here in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York State, and this mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, thank you, Assemblymember
Lopardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you should have never given me that
email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was your first problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really very nice of you to all be
here today, and you share, I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: our interest and passion in this new,
exciting crop, industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many of us, I'm sure,
in the room are old enough to have
[SPEAKER_01]: lamented for a very, very long time that
this crop was something we could not grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I became more familiar with the
potential of this crop, it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: unacceptable, to be honest with you,
that we had a consumer demand for
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were purchasing products.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were manufacturing products with
imported materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't make any sense to me
whatsoever that we weren't able to afford
[SPEAKER_01]: our farmers that opportunity and to give
manufacturers homegrown local product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the farm bill came up,
which came along, which allowed New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State to become a place where we could do
pilot research, Senator Amara and I jumped
[SPEAKER_01]: all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a bit of a stretch for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go one by one with the Vote Hemp
Why Industrial Hemp sheet and explain to
[SPEAKER_01]: people right off the bat that it was not
marijuana, it was a cousin, it was this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they finally understood, especially
for places like upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: the enormous economic potential for not
only farmers, but for manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from Endicott, New York,
and represent Endicott and Binghamton
[SPEAKER_01]: area, which was all about shoes and
computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a manufacturing town, and so many
places are as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get the economic developers to have
this come to clarity for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that this isn't just about growing a crop,
this is about producing goods and
[SPEAKER_01]: services, but making goods again in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what really began to
turn people around about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The following year, the farm bill gave us
another opportunity to not only research
[SPEAKER_01]: this crop, but to also market it,
transport it, process it, and sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were not for that particular bill,
all the research crops would have had to
[SPEAKER_01]: have been destroyed, which would have been
a terrible thing, because the 40 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful hemp that you're seeing depicted
in this logo behind us at JD Farms was
[SPEAKER_01]: just a spectacular thing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smells pretty good, too,
by the way, I must say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are now able to take advantage,
full advantage, of what they have allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've stalked this at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they've allowed, we've come right
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Ram Paul and Mitch McConnell are
the sponsors of these bills, and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our own senators, Senator Gillibrand,
are sponsors of the Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they are trying to figure this out
in Washington, New York State is
[SPEAKER_01]: positioning itself to be very competitive
in all manner of hemp, whether it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical, nutraceutical,
textiles, various food, and other products
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the federal government does relax
this, which will make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier for us, we will have the Northeast
pretty much sewed up, as far as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of you who are in the room who are
expecting to get involved in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think will be very pleased with the
outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commissioner Ball mentioned some of the
fabulous developments at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very lucky that the state is willing
to really come to assist on the DEA seed
[SPEAKER_01]: certification, seed acquisition issue,
and all the rest of these considerations
[SPEAKER_01]: with research dollars coming behind it and
trying to make it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who have been involved in
the craft beverage industry, once the
[SPEAKER_01]: state got its head wrapped around making
it easier for craft beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have seen the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you without a shadow of a
doubt that this is the next thing that the
[SPEAKER_01]: governor and team are putting their full
force and focus behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a very exciting time for those
of us who've long, long wished that hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: could be receiving its due.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to just say, in closing,
is that just to get everybody on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: page, we had 10 research licenses as part
of the original program, and those have
[SPEAKER_01]: all been filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is about to happen now as part of the
recent budget is going, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the commissioner mentioned,
there are going to be unlimited licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but regs have to be established
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're a little behind for this growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would fully expect, and correct me
if I'm wrong, that 2018 will very likely
[SPEAKER_01]: be the year when we can see a much larger
build-out among farmers who are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be critical, however,
that those farmers understand the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain and are going to be growing for a
particular market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not just randomly growing some
random cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be growing for a
particular market, and that market is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have processing available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have in the mix proposals right now
to do hubs in the area of whether it be on
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oil or in fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2018, you may very well be in a
position to have a marriage with a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular company that wants a certain
type of strain, and you may have a
[SPEAKER_01]: processor in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all seamless with the assistance
from the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for your patience over these
years and decades for some of us who have
[SPEAKER_01]: cared about this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our time has finally come, and I'm
absolutely delighted to be a part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and happy to play whatever role I need to
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
