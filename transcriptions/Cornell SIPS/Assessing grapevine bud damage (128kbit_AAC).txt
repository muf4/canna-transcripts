[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell

[SPEAKER_01]: It's March 11th, 2014 and we have had a
very cold winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the Lansing Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit minus 10 here on January 22nd and
then had several other instances where we
[SPEAKER_01]: went below zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Adam and I are out here cutting buds to
see what's alive and what's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to show you how this
process works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we do is we use a razor blade
and cut away at buds and look at what's
[SPEAKER_01]: alive inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to zoom up on a bud
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to remember that great buds
are what we call compound buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so within each bud that we cut,
there's actually a primary, a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: and a tertiary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found a great example here for
what's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've done is come in here and
that's what the bud looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sliced it with the razor blade,
opened it up and you can actually see the
[SPEAKER_01]: three buds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This center one is the primary and there's
the secondary and then there's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: green dot over here and that's the
tertiary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at the other side of the bud
here too and you can see those green dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are buds that are still alive after
this winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have the potential to produce
shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen is the primary will
grow first and as long as it grows well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unlikely the secondary or the
tertiary will ever grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we move up the cane here is another bud
that I cut and in this you can see that
[SPEAKER_01]: the center of that is actually brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's our primary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary bud is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been damaged by the cold but you can
see a little bit of green on either side
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the secondary and the tertiary and
those are both alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we do pre-pruning if we've
had some cold damage is that we go
[SPEAKER_01]: through, we actually cut these buds with a
razor blade and look at what proportion
[SPEAKER_01]: are alive and what proportion are dead
because that will tell us how many buds we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to leave on the vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'll know for example that to
balance this vine I want to have in this
[SPEAKER_01]: example maybe about 30 live shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I cut these and I know that only
about half of them are alive that means I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually need to leave 60 nodes rather
than 30 to get my 30 shoots through the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in many years if we haven't had cold
damage we don't bother doing this but in a
[SPEAKER_01]: year like this where we're seeing a lot of
damage in the Finger Lakes we go through
[SPEAKER_01]: and cut some buds first so we get a sample
and figure out what's alive and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: dead so we know how many more buds we need
to leave when we do our pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's March 11th 2014 and I'm in the
Lansing Vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a very cold winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had some bud damage that I
wanted to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've cut some buds here and this is
something that we frequently do before
[SPEAKER_01]: pruning if we've had cold events because
we want to see how many of our buds are
[SPEAKER_01]: alive and how many of our buds are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the number of buds we're going to
leave on a vine will know the number we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to have a balanced vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example it might be 30 in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I know half the buds are dead
I've got to leave 60 buds so that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've cut some buds here and I wanted to
show you you need to remember that great
[SPEAKER_01]: buds are actually compound buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so within every bud there's actually
three smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one where everything's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see a bigger set of circles
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the primary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the secondary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little one over here this little
wedge is called the tertiary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on this one when we cut it open all
three are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the primary the secondary and the
tertiary are all brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is growing from that bud this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one here it's a little harder
to see because the primary secondary and
[SPEAKER_01]: tertiary are actually alive here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this little middle green point here
this is our primary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alive and well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had not cut it it would grow into a
shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is our secondary bud and there is
our tertiary over here which is alive too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally it's a primary that will die
first so it's easy to find buds here where
[SPEAKER_01]: the primary is dead but the secondary is
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case the secondary bud would
actually grow and be a shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases it's not as fruitful as a
primary shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit will come out a couple of weeks
later and so it has less time to mature
[SPEAKER_01]: through the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it won't be a fruitful shoot but
at least there'll be a shoot there if the
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary is alive and the primary is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case we're hoping to find lots
of buds like this because we want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: an alive primary secondary and tertiary
bud.
