[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I would like to show some results
that you have got in Brazil for tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some slides I will show that our
tropical corn is not so tropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have worked in this species as
tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I would like to present some
issues that you have in Brazil in some
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives for the coming future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take advantage that you are paying
attention to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what will happen in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to introduce my team,
partners and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays I have 10 PhD students working in
my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have masters or I just one
undergrad student that you call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiating in scientific or scientific
school for undergrads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have two technicians working with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason that we organize our group
and you have work on the main goal of our
[SPEAKER_00]: group is tropical corn for the second
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil you have two growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer is the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call the winter or the second
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course in Brazil you don't have a
winter if you compare like a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a fall or at least a spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this second growing season has
increased in the last years, mainly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the demand for new hybrids,
for new varieties for this second growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season also has increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some international partners to
develop our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jean-Luc is one of our best partners in
Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are not, I change the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Crosa is another guy that have a lot
of some of our projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa State University, Jaminu,
Michigan State University, Gustavo Delos
[SPEAKER_00]: Campos and Edmund in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides corn, I also have some projects
with another companies, some privates and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government companies, for example,
I have some projects with Embrapa in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bracchiara, a grass, a forage grass that
cover nine million hectares in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe this is the most important crop
in Brazil, mainly for beef cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beans and coconut, all these projects
related to apply genome selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to improve the scheme and
accelerate the way to select plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have one project with EAC at
Campinas Institute Agronom and Cafe
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a self crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have projects with two private
companies, one for tropical corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: another signed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To support all these students and
researchers, most of my fellowships and
[SPEAKER_00]: scholarships are provided by CAPS and CNP
Key.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are federal councils that offer
these scholarships for the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have funding from FAPESP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a federal foundation only for the St.
Paul State and DuPont Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, I got an award called
Younger Professor Award based on my
[SPEAKER_00]: research in genome selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tropical corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since then, they have supported my lab
in genotype and some resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange some visits and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a short overview about Brazilian corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Brazilian corn can be separated
into different ages, until 80s and after
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 80s, we had a great migration in the
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This migration was due to new areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government and the price of the land
stimulate farmers from the southern part
[SPEAKER_00]: of Brazil migrated to the central areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these areas, the main crop was
soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the farmers need to improve the DOA to
take advantage of the weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in that region you can do more
than one growing season per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, find a way to pay the machines,
not only using ounces a year, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have weather conditions, soil conditions,
you can have two or three growing seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: and divide the cost of the machines for
two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this migration, until 80s, mainly 90%
of Brazilian corn was produced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we start this migration to these
central areas that you call Cerrados.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to savannas, African
savannas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same type of soil, the same type
of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 years ago, approximately 20 years
ago, the second growing season started for
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers in this region here and
became increasing year by year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until five years ago, when you had a
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second growing season we call
Safrinha.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in Portuguese, if you translate to
English, it means small growing season or
[SPEAKER_00]: small crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this small became the bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five years ago, we have this switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, the most important growing
season for corn is the winter growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Safrinha.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it Safrinha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this standing, we expect this
difference will increase in the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we will achieve a certain
plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summer growing season will not
disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will reduce in some areas only for
the southern part of Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, you can see in the central
areas, things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these combines harvesting soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you have some
planters sowing the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common to see in the central areas of
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest the corn, you can plant
cotton or beans and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these procedures in almost all
farmers, big farmers in these central
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, when you change the
growing season, you completely change the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day in life, and also the rainfall,
and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, we plant the second growing
season in January or early February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will harvest this corn in end of
May or in the early June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that this corn develop pretty well
during this first period here,
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the sowing, to the flowering time,
where you have a great amount of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the temperature tends to be stable
across the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these areas, we have a lot of warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, this is the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, during the day, we have 104
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is not during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, the temperature keeps very high,
and more than 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you consider the optimal temperature
for corn that's near to this temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's OK if you see during the day this
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you have this at night,
we have a lot of respiration or breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumption for energy keeps in a
high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this is the reason that the
Brazilian corn in the central areas
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a great yield or high yield
levels in the central areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the coming years, this is one of
the main interesting things to fix in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazilian corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change this angle or this pattern here of
the respiration curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the plant is under high
temperatures, the respiration rate tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to decrease faster than normally you have
seen in the tropical corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have other issues because we
migrated the area, changed the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changed the period of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these is price stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have these problems because we
compete with soybean for areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compete with other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult to forecast what will be
the amount of corn that you have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes farmers plant a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there is no corn enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So due to this price instability,
some farmers try to predict how much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen they will spend in this growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, they put low levels of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you develop a new variety or new
hybrids for these central areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: these new varieties must be nitrogen-use
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have a pattern of rainfalls,
but something else, something weird always
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rainfall season can be shorter or
longer or just change the period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also need varieties water-use
efficient and at the same time earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, we have hybrids in that
region that from plant to flowering time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes 55 days, 52 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to reduce this period,
but don't change the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing is tolerance for high
temperatures, mainly at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is until 20 years ago,
we have our major part or major production
[SPEAKER_00]: in the southern part of Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's in the central areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not sure if we import new
germoplasm and select these new varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: for these new areas or just move these
varieties for these new areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, we had a temperate or
subtropical germoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, we are working in central
areas like tropical areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have worked with correct germoplasm or
just companies move the germoplasm and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to select something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another problem that you have is the
Brazilian law for cultivar protection
[SPEAKER_00]: allows that anyone, anywhere can take the
new variety and use in your building
[SPEAKER_00]: program without paying any rights,
without any agreement, without anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I release a cultivar, Jean-Luc can take
at the same moment my new cultivar and use
[SPEAKER_00]: to cross in his program and it's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that, many companies left
those schemes to improve germoplasm for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is only recycling these
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take materials from the other companies,
sell the hybrid, select lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with your testers and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a loader game.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this loader game, the loser is the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the last 20 years, the thing
that you have seen is a plateau of
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because if you sell a hybrid,
this hybrid normally was obtained by a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross between two heterotic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sell this, you have like a real,
a recombinant hybrid line that is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic between these heterotic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to achieve the same level
of heterosis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, is it possible to use genome
selection to solve these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fast migration, but we think our
germoplasm didn't change so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a tool to do this change and
try to follow the same speed that this
[SPEAKER_00]: migration or the problems have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: To address these three things,
I brought three papers that we did during
[SPEAKER_00]: the last two years, trying to figure out
what happened in our germoplasm or what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in Brazilian germoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is, what's your
germoplasm?
[SPEAKER_00]: We published this paper last year in plus
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to understand what is your
germoplasm, you took 20 hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 hybrids that was considered the most
important hybrids in Brazilian fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: covering seven breeding companies from
public to private companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these hybrids represent 90% of the
Brazilian germoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be in seed sales or in the area
covered by these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We genotype these hybrids using the
Illumina voting gate, a low-density panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's necessary to cover genome
and see the relationship between these
[SPEAKER_00]: germoplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupon pioneers were part of this
genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also included the NEM parents,
the NEM that was developed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what's the relationship between our
hybrids and between our Brazilian hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: and the parents that was used to form the
NEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first result show we have seven
companies, Agromain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Agromain is Monsanto in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: They select other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two branches trying to avoid
some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that Monsanto is not most
friendly company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that Dow is the company that,
in average, is more related with other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In average, you don't have a stronger
relationship between the companies'
[SPEAKER_00]: germoplasms besides Dow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put these hybrids and try to
figure out the structure, we see these
[SPEAKER_00]: partners it's almost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have the 20 hybrids that we
evaluated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the companies, the germoplasms of the
companies tends to be separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than we thought, when they tried
to sell hybrids from the other companies
[SPEAKER_00]: and use these lines in their germoplasm,
nowadays, this germoplasm is not so
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we expect, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until now, we have a good amount of
genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern is for the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this behavior remain, what will happen
in the coming years?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem that we identify is when
you put these hybrids with the NEM
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the Brazilian hybrids are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put in the population structure,
you can see our Brazilian hybrids that we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that they are tropical,
they are in the same group that
[SPEAKER_00]: intemperate in popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you can see the tropical lines
that were used to form the NEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I expect, the companies didn't bring
new germoplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only moved the germoplasms for the
central areas and tried to select
[SPEAKER_00]: something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our germoplasm is not so tropical as we
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to address the first problem,
to select for yield and flowering time,
[SPEAKER_00]: grain moisture, as you call early years,
to try to select those things together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did a very simple and classical paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by my master's student two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to address this problem, he used 64
hybrid lines that we call at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We evaluated these tropical lines for
grain yield, days to flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and grain moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain yield, of course, production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And days to flowering and grain moisture
is, in this case, they are indicators for
[SPEAKER_00]: precocity, urgency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need one line or one hybrid that
spend a little time to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you harvest this hybrid,
the grain moisture tends to be very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we evaluated these lines during two
years, two locations, and two levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the phenotypes, we proceed with
two ways to analyze this data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blub single trait and the blub multi
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the blub single trait, I evaluate each
one of these traits separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put all these traits together and
use a multi trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after I got these blubs, we used
three ways to do the simultaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The additive effect, giving the same
weight for each one of these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulamba mock, that is the rank selection
index, and independent cooling levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: To evaluate what is the best scenario,
you compare based on the gains and
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidences of selection for all these
traits, if you select just one per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you evaluate the correlations of
these traits, you can see that only days
[SPEAKER_00]: to flowering and grain moisture are
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not expected in your germoplast,
but this correlation is not so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you evaluate and compare the ways
to predict breeding values or the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic values of our lines and our
hybrids, you can see the blub single trait
[SPEAKER_00]: or multi trait for these traits are not so
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the covariance between these
traits is not so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no correction between these
traits in the ranks or the genotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: values for the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if I select based on
index selection, rank, or cooling levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have completely different results or
ranks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best that we identify is the additive
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good new, because this is the
simplest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to figure out what's the
weight for each one of the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I plot these three traits here,
you identify I need one line that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: few days to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That at the harvest time, there is a
little amount of water in the grains and
[SPEAKER_00]: also high levels of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this additive index in blub single
trait, I could select the best lines for
[SPEAKER_00]: this purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these simultaneous selections for a
grain yield early is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news, using the simple way,
it's the most efficient way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have nowadays a lot of markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of these fancy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can solve some problems using
classical breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, genome selection for nitrogen use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper was not published yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent to CropScience, my PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the aid of CROSSA, we evaluated
739 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hybrids were obtained from a
pairwise crossing between 49 weird lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hybrids were evaluated in two
locations, two nitrogen levels for a grain
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, rent height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we genotyped the parents using the
F-metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After quality control, we had almost 54 k
snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to select one hybrid that
under low nitrogen conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: this hybrid has a good performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if in that year, the farmers decide,
oh, I will put more nitrogen, so I need
[SPEAKER_00]: one hybrid that at the same time is
tolerant but also responsive for nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need hybrids that these two faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, we evaluate in two
levels of nitrogen and try to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the best way to proceed genome
selection under GBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, GBI, its locations and
levels of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these scenarios, we compared three
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first model is the simplest one,
the reaction norm across environment where
[SPEAKER_00]: we have just the environment effects as
fixed effects and the main effect for
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, it's reaction norm plus
GBI effect as a random effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is like a region regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two models are G-blood,
and the third one is GBI model where
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of using G blub, we use the RR
blub.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this model, we have environment effects
as fixed effects, the main marker effect
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of main effect for genotypes,
and we have a deviation or the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the GBI marker effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also test two kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The linear, the most common, proposed by
Van Raiden in 2008, and the Gaussian
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel proposed last, almost two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gaussian kernel, the only thing
different is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do the kinship matrix,
we use this explanation between the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance between each one of these
individuals, and you divide by the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, after some procedures, we use this
bandwidth as equal one, trying to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: some problems like sparse kinship
matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use this second one, the Gaussian
kernel, it's similar to RHKS method that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can capture some non-additive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our idea that using this Gaussian
kernel you can have different components
[SPEAKER_00]: of variance for each environment and
capture these not linear effects or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-additive effects due to the GBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross-validation, it's the Potter way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use 80% of the hybrids to training set,
and the remaining 20% for the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the second way proposed by
Bourguignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mimics a problem faced by the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some lines evaluated in some
environments, but not in all environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a BGLR package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Bayesian package for genome
selection to run all these analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results that we got was really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a grand new, using our plant-high,
using that model, the region regression
[SPEAKER_00]: model, when I have the main effect for
markers and the deviation effect for
[SPEAKER_00]: markers due to the GBI, for both traits,
we have a great increase in accuracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 80% in plant-high and 70% for a
grand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can predict, regardless if it's in
high nitrogen, low nitrogen, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: location, we can predict pretty well using
this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model using Gaussian kernel seems
to be better, and also much better than
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can predict pretty well hybrids for
this condition in low nitrogen or high
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have work on improved tropical
inducers of haplites.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring these inducers from CIMIT
or temperate areas and put in resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, normally the weather is too
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot obtain any haplites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way is trying to cross with
tropical corn and try to select something
[SPEAKER_00]: more adapted for these high-level
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also developed some R packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I present these two packages here,
the SNP-Ready and B-Breather.
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP-Ready is a package to work with these
big data sets for molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B-Breather, it's an interface of R
using China to teach and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-breathing concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab, the main reason and the main
objective is quantitative genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic studies, and always we try to use
our germoplasts as evaluating for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: use efficiency and related traits like
roots, roots traits, or physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2014, we also make agreement with a
private company and try to apply this
[SPEAKER_00]: heteroprenotype in your germoplasm and
trying to adapt something cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy and fast to collect this data and
apply in plant-breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main reason for all these things
separated is to integrate and develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: new breeding scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to study some branches
separated if you don't have one way or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't think, how can I integrate and
reshape my breeding program and transform
[SPEAKER_00]: my breeding program into something more
efficient and something faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I present a lot of problems about
Brazil, but you have many things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the problem in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: A problem can be seen as an opportunity
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Brazil, about Brazil,
we have a lot of misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Brazil is seen abroad as
bananas, monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest, anaconda, and so we can hear weird
things about Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are carnival, soccer, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of our nature, it's part of our
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The misconception is we are not just these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil has some of the best universities
in agriculture, colleges in the tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have also in Brapa, Embraer,
Petrobras, and big companies that have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed great researches in many areas,
in many fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the misconception is just to summarize
Brazil in these things that is broadcast
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have real problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real problem in Brazil is corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know exactly how much money
we throw away every year due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides these political issues,
we have all ingredients to be successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because tropical areas are challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great variability of environment
in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Brazilian map for the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have six, seven different types of
weather in just one country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our Brazilian soil map.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a blend of these things,
imagine the amount of environments that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have on hand to select and capture
these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, mainly in this light yellow area,
we can have up to three growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with different weather across the year,
with different rainfall, different day
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths, so we have a lot of interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have a great diverse of pests and
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's a great source of a
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great source of a hypothesis,
many things to test and try to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe the best advantage that you have
nowadays, we have nine million hectares
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about the Amazon
forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great amount of land that you
can use for the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there is another country with the
same amount of area available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To expand agriculture, to expand the
research and all other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem in this area is
transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can produce pretty well in the tropical
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how we can do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is after we produce,
after the production, how to collect this
[SPEAKER_00]: production and drive this production to
the ports and export all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably this is the main issue for the
coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main issue will not be genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as your former president used to say,
yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in the coming years, we have the
solution for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
