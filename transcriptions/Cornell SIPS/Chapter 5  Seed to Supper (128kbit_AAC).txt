[SPEAKER_00]: As a facilitator, after you plan the
garden, you plant the garden, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're caring for the garden to make sure
the garden is successful, the last thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the most, it's a celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're celebrating the fruits of labor,
you're celebrating the harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're excited, but also it's a time of
reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think back on what went wrong in
the planting process, what went wrong in
[SPEAKER_00]: the planting process, and what went wrong
in your approach of caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can connect the growth of the
garden with the growth of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that they're gonna grow
simultaneously together and that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a perfect garden the first time in a
perfect community, actually what might
[SPEAKER_00]: happen is that if you're working with a
community that's not used to gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gardening might not be as successful,
but you'll be able to see how close the
[SPEAKER_00]: community is, how the fabric of the
community has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important part of harvest,
because now we can look back and think
[SPEAKER_00]: back, oh so we grew this vegetable,
we grew this, and it didn't grow well here
[SPEAKER_00]: in our community, or it didn't grow well
in this soil, so let's rethink about
[SPEAKER_00]: something different to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a good time where a facilitator
could bring in different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you don't wanna go in day one
with your own mindset of what vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be grown in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really wanna preserve communities and
what they wanna grow, but the second time
[SPEAKER_00]: around, in reflection, you can bring up
ideas and conversation about new fruits or
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables for a community to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might want to or might not want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the community knows you more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came in day one, as a stranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might even call you an imposter,
but then, as you care for the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see how serious you are about the
garden, in harvest, because you've stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out a whole season with them, and they see
that you're committed to the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you get to have additional
conversations about the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: types of foods and things like that.
Thank you.
