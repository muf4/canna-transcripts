[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jay and today I'm going to talk
about QTL mapping of potato cis nematode
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance and two trace of two agronomic
trace in data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I performed three different research
projects evaluating two molecular markers
[SPEAKER_04]: for selecting potato cis nematode
resistance clone and QTL analysis of new
[SPEAKER_04]: potato cis nematode resistance and QTL
analysis of chip color and specific
[SPEAKER_04]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to help you understanding, I start with
introduction of potato cis nematode.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two potato cis nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is Globodural Osocansis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one is Globodural Halida.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have a common name called golden
nematode and pale cis nematode
[SPEAKER_04]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture shows juvenile stage of the
golden nematode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for your convenience for today,
I'm going to use these two common names
[SPEAKER_04]: for following slide, golden nematode and
pale cis nematode.
[SPEAKER_04]: This pathogen is a soil-borne pathogen and
it has a really stable dormant stage which
[SPEAKER_04]: is called cis.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the one report, the nematode
could survive for over 30 years by
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining this dormant stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it can be easily transferred by
arm management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of these features, once it's
infected in a potato field, it is very
[SPEAKER_04]: hard to eradicate or control this
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the United States, the golden nematode
is distributed in New York State here and
[SPEAKER_04]: pale cis nematodes distributed in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_04]: Detection of the pale cis nematode always
initiate crunching action and threading
[SPEAKER_04]: embargo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of the three most serious
potato pathogens in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the APIS, if golden nematode
became widely prevalent without
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate control, annual loss would
reach $4.8 billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think instead of this tax,
I think this picture will reflect how
[SPEAKER_04]: scary this pathogen is.
[SPEAKER_04]: These bags are showing the potato yield
from the non-infected field and these bags
[SPEAKER_04]: represent potato yield from infested
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the huge difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why I started to study
golden nematode resistance of the potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1941, the golden nematode was first
observed in the United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in Nassau County on a long
island, New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after the first detection,
golden nematode, especially pest type R01
[SPEAKER_04]: of the golden nematode, gradually appeared
in eight other counties.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this moment, let me briefly explain how
we can divide into the different pest
[SPEAKER_04]: type.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if a nematologist take a
sample from the infested field,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is one of them, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are multiple ways, but the
nematologist inoculate the samples on
[SPEAKER_04]: these three different wild potato species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the nematode can survive on one
plant, we can put the plus sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the nematode cannot survive on what
we produce, we can put the minus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by combining these results,
we can divide into the multiple pest
[SPEAKER_04]: types.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden nematode composed of five different
pest types and pelsus nematode is composed
[SPEAKER_04]: of three different pest types.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to emphasize that pest
type R01 has been predominant pest type
[SPEAKER_04]: for a long time, not only in many European
countries, but also in New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many researchers put an effort and time
to find resistance genes effective to this
[SPEAKER_04]: pest type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, they could find H1 gene,
which is very effective against the pest
[SPEAKER_04]: type R01.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is known to be located on a chromosome
five.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the many potato breeding program in
the world using these genes was really
[SPEAKER_04]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Cornell breeding program
totally could release 24 potato varieties,
[SPEAKER_04]: which include H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, these potato varieties
works well to control the damage of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pest type R01.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there was one drawback in the
Cornell potato breeding program when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to the R01 resistance, because we
still relied on time consuming bioassay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to reduce the amount of the bioassay,
maybe marker assist selection is one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the good options.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I start to evaluate these two markers,
which is known to be tightly linked to the
[SPEAKER_04]: H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from now on, I'm going to explain how I
evaluate the two molecular markers for
[SPEAKER_04]: selecting R01 resistance potato clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture shows PCR result of 57 marker
and TG689 markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pike, this is one of the cultivar of the
potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is known to be resistance against
the R01.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Catarin is susceptible cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I use these two cultivar as both
resistance control and susceptible
[SPEAKER_04]: control.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see in this picture,
resistance clone produce 450 base pair PCR
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And susceptible clone produce 1,500 base
pair PCR product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I tested other breeding clones or
cultivars, I could get the same results
[SPEAKER_04]: like this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I tested TG689 marker from the
resistance clone, I could see 114 base
[SPEAKER_04]: pair PCR product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could not see any PCR product from
the susceptible clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of that, I also used BCH marker as
a PCR control to check the PCR quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for your convenience, I'm going to use
plus sign for presence of the 400 base
[SPEAKER_04]: pair when it comes to the 57R PCR test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to use negative sign for
presence of the 1,500 PCR product when I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about the 57R marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to use plus sign for
presence of the 14 base pair PCR product
[SPEAKER_04]: when I talk about TG689 PCR test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And absence of this PCR product will be
marked as a negative sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I first tested 38 potato cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I expected before, the markers work
quite well.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, when I tested all 20
susceptible cultivars, all PCR test showed
[SPEAKER_04]: negative results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I tested 18 resistance cultivars,
17 of them showed positive for the 57R.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 14 clones was positive for the TG689.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there are some exceptions,
such as Endover, Eva, and King-Harry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Endover shows negative sign, even though
this is R01 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eva and King-Harry showed a negative
response from the TG689 PCR test,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though those are R01 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose that this caused by the
recombination event.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, I start to talk about how I tested
Cornell breeding clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: My purpose was to test whether the two
markers work well in a Cornell potato
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding program or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I collected 342 Cornell breeding clones
and performed the exact same test,
[SPEAKER_04]: bio assay and two PCR tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this table summarized all the
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see it here, there are multiple
combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on the combination of the
research, of the PCR test and the bio
[SPEAKER_04]: assay, I could divide into the eight
different cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if a clone was resistance in
a bio assay and showed a positive result
[SPEAKER_04]: in a 57R and the TG689, the clone belonged
to case one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if another clone, which is susceptible
and showed a negative response from the
[SPEAKER_04]: two PCR tests, the clone belonged to case
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I expected before, the majority
resistance clone belonged to case one and
[SPEAKER_04]: majority susceptible clones belonged to
case eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of them, I believe because of
the recombination, so I'm going to call
[SPEAKER_04]: from case two to seven as a mismatch for
your convenience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So majority mismatch shows a relatively
small number, 861 or zero and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I saw the case four compared to
the other mismatches, case four shows a
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively higher number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to come back case four in the
following slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I test 342 clones, I also calculated
positive prediction value and negative
[SPEAKER_04]: prediction value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Positive prediction values are calculated
by determining the percentage of the clone
[SPEAKER_04]: with the marker that were resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative prediction values were calculated
by determining the percentage of the
[SPEAKER_04]: potato clones lacking the marker that were
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see in this table,
both markers really well, especially for
[SPEAKER_04]: positive prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: This means once you saw the positive
response from the PCR test, the clones had
[SPEAKER_04]: a really high chance to have H1 gene in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, negative prediction was
much, much lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this cannot be a big problem for
the breeding purpose because potato
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders just focusing on selecting
resistance clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not interested in selecting
susceptible clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we conclude that from this result,
the two PCR marker 57RTG689 can be applied
[SPEAKER_04]: into the future Cornell breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now let me go back to case four
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see here, even though these
clones are resistance, they show negative
[SPEAKER_04]: response from the two PCR.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to figure out what happened here,
I go back to the list of the case four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So second column shows the list of the
case four clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And third clone and fourth clone shows
parents information of each clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while analyzing this table,
I realized that the clone E48-2 frequently
[SPEAKER_04]: appeared as either male parent or female
parent for these clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I re-performed the same bio assay in
the two PCR test for E48-2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interestingly, I could not see any
difference compared to the general R01
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this shows resistance in a bio assay
and also plus response from 57R and the
[SPEAKER_04]: TG689.
[SPEAKER_04]: So quite similar to the general R01
resistance clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go back to the pedigree information
of this clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly, I realized that Solana
virtuality, this is one of the wild potato
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this features predominantly in a
pedigree of the E48-2.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the Dallam et al,
some assertion of this wild potato species
[SPEAKER_04]: are resistance R01.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose that previous readers
intergresed an unknown R01 resistance
[SPEAKER_04]: genes came from the S virtuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that E48-2 include not only
H1 gene in it, but also another resistance
[SPEAKER_04]: is located on another column, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it results in those kinds of
mismatches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all for our first research
project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm going to explain QTA analysis
of new potato cysts nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: New potato cyst nematode resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned before, pest type R01 have
been predominant pest type for a long time
[SPEAKER_04]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in 1995, the new pest type R02
was first discovered in the Steuben County
[SPEAKER_04]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem was that the H1 resistance
is not effective against R02.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why I started QTA
analysis of R01.
[SPEAKER_04]: R02 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: For this research project, I prepared the
Y36 population, which came from the cross
[SPEAKER_04]: between Ni121 and Ni115.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two parents are auto tetraploid
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of them are heterodigous
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ni121 is R01 resistance, and Ni115 is
R02 susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: For QTA mapping, I used 182% resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: For genotyping, I used a soil cap SNP
shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is quite useful, too, because this is
composed of 8,303 SNP position.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can have a higher chance to find some
QTA position.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, reference for each SNPs are
available from the Spood database.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can find the location of the SNP
position, such as chromosome number,
[SPEAKER_04]: physical map position, and also short
description for related gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after scanning the DNA sample of the
Y36 population with this soil cap SNP,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could get the raw data, which is called
theta score, or theta value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Theta score is like a number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to transform from theta score to
general genotype data, such as AAAA,
[SPEAKER_04]: or AAAB, AABD, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after transforming the genotype data,
I load on one software, which is called
[SPEAKER_04]: tetraploid SNP map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetraploid SNP map is specially designed
for QTA analysis of auto tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after loading the selected SNP marker
on this software, as we can imagine,
[SPEAKER_04]: all markers are mixed in each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through the clustering function belong
to this software, I could collect the SNP
[SPEAKER_04]: markers which are on the same chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a potato composed of 12 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So each circle represent each chromosome
in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: So through the ordering step, I could
rearrange the selected marker which are on
[SPEAKER_04]: the same chromosome in an order,
like this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then through the phasing step,
I could decide which of the four homo
[SPEAKER_04]: lobes each marker resides on, like this
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, unlike the diploid,
QTA analysis, like a general diploid QTA
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis, some manual process are
necessary for a phasing step in the auto
[SPEAKER_04]: tetraploid QTA analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So compared to the diploid QTA analysis,
this process take more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after completing phasing step,
I could get linkage map.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the example of the linkage
map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I crossed the two heterodox parents,
I could draw two different steps of the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic map.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, homo lobe one to four
represent four homo lobes of the Ni121.
[SPEAKER_04]: And homo lobe five to eight represent four
homo lobes of the Ni115.
[SPEAKER_04]: And left side representing the genetic
map, all SNP markers are combined.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I'm going to share the
challenges that I encountered while
[SPEAKER_04]: performing the auto tetraploid QTA method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike the general diploid SNP calling,
tetraploid SNP calling a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me share one example.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the graph showing the theta
score value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So x-axis represent theta score from zero
to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't need to worry about y-axis
in this case, because these y-axis relate
[SPEAKER_04]: you to the policy issue of the SNP.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if a clone has an AAAA genotype,
generally the clones centered on the zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if another clone has an AAAB,
that clones generally centered on 0.25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if another clone has an AABB,
the clones centered on 0.5 and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the clones are well distributed,
like the first example, we can easily
[SPEAKER_04]: assign appropriate genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, look at this example.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see here, even though there are
multiple cluster, it's not easy to assign
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I spent a lot of time assigning best
genotype for each clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have been struggling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But fortunately, in 2017, Jeffrey and
everyone released a new R package called
[SPEAKER_04]: the cluster code.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can overcome this difficulty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, before the Tetrapoid SNP that I used
for this QT analysis, there was only one
[SPEAKER_04]: software which is called Tetrapoid Map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is previous version of the
Tetrapoid SNP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a lot of limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: One example would be the number of the SNP
markers that I can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only less than 50 SNP markers can be used
for each clone if I rely on this software.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means I can lose many, many chances
to find significant QTL pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before that, I could not find
significant QTL pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once I start to use Tetrapoid SNP,
the newest version released in 2017,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could find significant QTL picks related
to our two registers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, there are still manual steps
during the link mapping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned before, compared to the
general deployed QTL mapping,
[SPEAKER_04]: auto-Tetrapoid QTL mapping takes more
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks to the newly released softwares,
I could get the excellent genome coverage.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my case, I could select 2,761 SNP
markers to cover 12 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, several hundred
markers can cover each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means I can have a higher chance to
find QTL pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at the map coverage.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see here, most of them are
well-covered by the SNP markers,
[SPEAKER_04]: around like 99%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a result, I could get really
excellent genome coverage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture shows a SNP marker that I
use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green color represents SNP marker
segregated in an Ni1-15.
[SPEAKER_04]: And red color represents the SNP marker
segregated on an Ni1-21.
[SPEAKER_04]: And black color represents SNP marker
segregated in both parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, SNP markers are
well-distributed across the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, now to complete the QTL mapping,
I had to load the phenotype data on the
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetrapoid SNP map.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to explain how I measure the
proteolysis nematode resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: After I prepared the Y36 population,
I planted it into each pot in a
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after two weeks later,
I inoculate 8,000 eggs into each pot,
[SPEAKER_04]: like this way, and then kept growing for
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the plants start to wilt,
I transfer all soil and plants material
[SPEAKER_04]: into paper bag and have wait for one month
for drying period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once all samples are completely dried,
the samples are transferred to the
[SPEAKER_04]: phenolic funnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: This silver color represent phenolic
funnel, specially designed for separating
[SPEAKER_04]: cysts from the dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the high pressure water in this
funnel, I could separate cysts from the
[SPEAKER_04]: dirt and plant materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: The collected cysts were counted under the
microscope, like this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned before, this biocite
takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I had to spend three months
for growing and inoculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another one month for drying period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on one labor force, phenolic
funnel process can be performed only for
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 to 25 samples per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And counting process can be performed less
than 20 samples per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my case, I used a full replication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to grow around like 860 samples
in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a result, to complete this whole
process, I had to use around like one
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see here, reducing this
biostate amount is really important for
[SPEAKER_04]: selecting nematode resistance core.
[SPEAKER_04]: After getting the original phenotype data,
I transformed to the low temp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because original phenotype data skewed
toward the right side too much,
[SPEAKER_04]: once I transformed, I could get the
distribution close to the normal
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I load this data on the tetraposim
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two pairs located here and here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of the examples of the QTL
map, especially chromosome 5 QTL map.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this case, x-axis represents the
genetic map position.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unit is centimorgan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And y-axis represents low score.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found the two significant QTL peaks
on chromosome 5, 26 centimorgan with a low
[SPEAKER_04]: score of 13.4.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second largest QTL peaks at 59
centimorgan with a low score of 6.6.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the worker mentioned before,
I was really happy with getting this
[SPEAKER_04]: picture because I spent around like five
to six years to see this picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, when I get this one,
I complain about taking a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_04]: while discussing with the worker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the worker told me, I have to wait
for 17 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we was really happy with getting this
picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, QTL analysis was completed
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we was wondering whether these
two QTL peaks represent previously known
[SPEAKER_04]: nematode resistance genes or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect that this would represent H1
gene because the H1 gene is known to be
[SPEAKER_04]: distant end of the long arm of the
chromatin 5.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I suspect this QTL peak
represents GRP1 gene because GRP1 gene is
[SPEAKER_04]: known to be resistant to both old nematode
and the pelses nematode as well as it is
[SPEAKER_04]: also located on a chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to characterize these two QTL peaks,
I added two additional tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is PCR test with a 57 marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, I performed the PCR test for
y-axis Y36 population with a 57 marker,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is known to be linked to the H1
gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I used the PCR results as a
phenotype data for catapulting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could map the location of the 57R or
I can say H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, thanks to the support of the Dr.
Dendron in the University of Idaho,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could achieve the G-polar resistance
data of the same mapping population,
[SPEAKER_04]: y-36.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also load this G-polar resistance
data on the catapulting nematode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the result.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second picture shows the RL2
resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And third picture shows 57R or H1 gene
location.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last picture shows G-polar
resistance QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: PA2-3 means a mixture of PES type 2 and 2.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I check the location of H1 gene,
as you can see here, it was located on a
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome 5, which is very close to the
second QTL peak of the RL2 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I check the G-polar resistance
QTL peak, it was perfectly matched with
[SPEAKER_04]: the most significant QTL peak of the RL2
resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from this, I also confirmed that this
second large QTL peak represented H1 gene
[SPEAKER_04]: and this QTL peak represented GRP1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because as I mentioned before,
GRP1 gene is known to be resistant to both
[SPEAKER_04]: golden nematode and pelsic nematode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I thought that H1 gene appears
to provide some resistance against RL2,
[SPEAKER_04]: presumably due to the presence of the low
percentage of RL1 in the RL2 population.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to mention at this point is
that originally RL2 obtained from the
[SPEAKER_04]: field which initially infested with PES
type RL1.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the original RL2 samples mixed with a
small amount of RL1.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose that maybe H1 gene also works
for this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: But further analysis, of course,
should be following to clarify what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also checked the percent of variance
explained at each position.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I check the RL2 resistance at the
26th centimorgan, I'm going to call for
[SPEAKER_04]: convenience RL2A.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows 24% percent of variance
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I check the G-polar resistance
QTL peak at here, which I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_04]: PA2 slash 3A.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this also shows 9.2% of variance
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them are quite significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I check this position,
RL2 resistance peak at here, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: call RL2B.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are explained 13%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both of them seem to be really
important position for RL2 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on the information provided by
the tetraplasin image, I marked the QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: position on the genetic map.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned before, HOMO 1 to 4
represent 4 HOMOs and 9.121.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 5 to 8 represent 4 HOMOs and 9.115.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, RL2A and PA2
slash 3As are overlaid each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I check the RL2B and RL57
location, both stems are on the same
[SPEAKER_04]: location as well as same HOMOLOs,
3 and 6.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also support the idea that this area
includes GRP1 gene, and these two areas
[SPEAKER_04]: include H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is redundant or extra
research project, but for double checking
[SPEAKER_04]: these two positions, I also performed the
GWAS with the software released by the
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeffrey Enderman's group, RRBLOB and GWAS
poly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, I used the exactly same
marker data and the phenotype data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, both of them are
perfectly matched because the top picture
[SPEAKER_04]: shows a genetic map that I developed
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the most closest SNMP marker was
C25031.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the most closest SNMP marker to 59
centimargon was C254365.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, when I check the
57R GWAS out, when I checked the 57R QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: through the GWAS, the most significant QTL
peak located on a SNMP marker,
[SPEAKER_04]: C254365, which is perfectly matched with
this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I checked the RL2 resistance,
there were two peaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I checked their location,
this one matched with this SNMP marker,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this one matched with this SNMP
marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this GWAS study also support the idea
that these two positions are really
[SPEAKER_04]: important for RL2 resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on these results, our lab decided
to develop a diagnostic marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Shu Ping, she's a lab technician
in our lab, already developed one CAPS
[SPEAKER_04]: marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, she started from the C25031.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when she tested the newly designed
marker with several resistance cones and
[SPEAKER_04]: susceptible cones, at this point,
the results are well-matched.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to test more cones,
not only in New York breeding cones,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also in other states, such as Idaho.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to apply the newly designed CAPS
marker into the corner breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now I'm going to start the QTL
analysis of chip color and the specific
[SPEAKER_04]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two traits are really important in
the potato chipping industry, because the
[SPEAKER_04]: lighter color potato chip if you guys open
the lathes, you can see really white color
[SPEAKER_04]: from the chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those colors are really preferred by
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever we do the breeding program,
we want to select lighter potato chip
[SPEAKER_04]: color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, specific gravity is important since
it is always related to starch content and
[SPEAKER_04]: starch density.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the reason why I performed this
research project with the same population
[SPEAKER_04]: that I used in a nematode study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used the same mapping population,
Y30 population.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two pairs shows quite good color,
but especially MN115 shows extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: lighter chip color compared to the other
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is quite useful clone for
selecting or developing chipping potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this case, I used 195 cones for QTL
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to explain how I measure the
chip color and the specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: For measuring chip color, I use nine
scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one, two, three, and this is nine,
the darkest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to measure the specific gravity,
I use this equation, weight in air divided
[SPEAKER_04]: by rate in air minus weight in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have measured during four years,
from 2010 to 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after getting the phenotype data,
I calculate the broad sense irritability
[SPEAKER_04]: for each trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, both of them
shows relatively higher irritability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chip color was around like a seven,
and specific gravity is 0.75.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also after that, I transformed the
original phenotype data to the below.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, the original phenotype data
does not show really good normal
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once I transformed to the below,
I can see much better normal distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: like this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, when I performed the QTL analysis
with the original phenotype data,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not see the QTL peaks,
which consistently showed up on the same
[SPEAKER_04]: position.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after I transformed to the below,
I could see many QTS, which showed up on
[SPEAKER_04]: the same position on the same chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose that maybe those are because
of the G by E effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by transforming to the below,
I could more focus on genetic effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after getting the below data,
I can compare, first of all, across the
[SPEAKER_04]: year, and also I can compare, I checked
the correlation between chip color and the
[SPEAKER_04]: specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see in this table,
there's no big difference between two
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see the specific gravity,
all correlations are around like a nine,
[SPEAKER_04]: so really high.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no huge difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though chip color shows
relatively smaller correlation compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: specific gravity, but still it's quite
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them show over 0.7.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could not see huge difference across
the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I checked the correlation between
chip color and the specific gravity,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see the negative correlation,
even though the value itself is relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is quite good sign for the potato
breeder, because if a breeder focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: lighter color, that means we can have a
chance to select the higher specific
[SPEAKER_04]: gravity, which is preferred by the potato
chip company as well at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is quite good sign for
breeding purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I found a lot of QTL peaks from
the many multiple chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, C, C represent chip color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And number 2010, 2012 represent the
phenotype data from each year.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned before, I measure phenotype
data in 2010, 11, 12, and 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these represent each year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an all.
[SPEAKER_04]: All means after I transformed to the blob
data, I could get five different set blob
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four represent each year, 2010 to 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last one, last blob data set was
obtained by pulling all phenotype data
[SPEAKER_04]: across the four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, all represent the blob
data obtained by pulling all phenotype
[SPEAKER_04]: data across the four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from this table, first of all,
I could find significant QTL on chromosome
[SPEAKER_04]: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly, chromosome 3,
4, 7 shows the QTL peaks, which
[SPEAKER_04]: consistently appeared on same position or
very close position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in this case, the solid scale
represent the QTL making darker color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hollow scale represent the QTL making
lighter color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this shows where the QTL peaks locate
among the four homologs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I see the chromosome 7,
there was larger QTL for chip color,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially homolog 7, which came from the
N115, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this explains 13% of the variance
explained for four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is quite important QTL
peak for future chip color selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And near here, two carbide genes,
sucrose phosphate synthesisase and plasma
[SPEAKER_04]: membrane proton ATPase located within the
one low support interval for this QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I checked the chromosome 3,
there was minor QTL for chip color located
[SPEAKER_04]: at 67 centimorgans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a putative invertase inhibitor gene is
located about 1.1 million base pairs away
[SPEAKER_04]: from this QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: This table shows the QTL peak of the
specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: SG represents specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of them are the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this case, arrow head toward the
downside represent lowering specific
[SPEAKER_04]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the arrow head toward the upside
represent the QTL making or increasing the
[SPEAKER_04]: specific gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while analyzing, I realized that
chromosome 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 shows the QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: peak, which appeared on the same position
or very close position each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: While analyzing the table, I found that on
the chromosome 4, the most significant QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: peaks exist at the year 28 centimorgan,
explaining 6.4% to 11% of the variance
[SPEAKER_04]: explained depending on the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a gene encoding phosphofructokinase is
about 200,000 base pair away from the QTL
[SPEAKER_04]: peaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: This play important role in basically
control the first committed step of the
[SPEAKER_04]: glycolysis respiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the starch content represent the
amount of the starch synthesis less the
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of the respired away from,
this gene become like a really interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: candidate for this QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chromosome 2 has a single QTL at the 72
centimorgan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a candidate gene glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase is mapped around like a
[SPEAKER_04]: 500,000 base pair from the target QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: And chromosome 5 also show the minor QTL
at the 31 centimorgan.
[SPEAKER_04]: A gene coding for starch granule bound R01
protein is located around 300,000 base
[SPEAKER_04]: pair from this QTL peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And silencing this gene is known to
increase the starch level in the lips.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is important for future
specific gravity selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me summarize this whole
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned before, these two markers
can be used for coronary breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the QTL at the 26 centimorgan of the
chromosome 5 confer resins to both R02 and
[SPEAKER_04]: PA2-3 past type.
[SPEAKER_04]: And H1 gene appears to provide some resins
against R02, presumably due to the
[SPEAKER_04]: presence of a low percentage of R01 in the
R02 population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cheap color specific grains were
highly periodable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And notable QTL peak for cheap color
detected on chromosome 3 and 7.
[SPEAKER_04]: Notable QTL peaks for specific grains were
observed on chromosome 2, 4, and 5.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to appreciate my committee
member.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long story, make sure that thank you for
your patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate Xiaoyong's encouragement.
[SPEAKER_04]: She always encouraged me to start a
research project.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're interested in research projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rodney Copeland gave me a lot of
advice about international agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm really interested in
international agriculture, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: reducing the hunger problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me a lot of good suggestions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate the colleagues as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are my lab members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they helped me a lot to practice
presentation and to do the research
[SPEAKER_04]: project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And technicians are amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these guys work really well and
support me a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate Shu Ping and Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Michael Muzerik gave me a chance
to do the TA at first a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he gave me the chance,
I could practice, especially like I could
[SPEAKER_04]: get the teaching experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Darlene helped me to practice this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Denise helped me a lot for statistical
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I learned a lot of important
statistical method from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nematologists support me a lot as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I did not have any experience in a
nematology, but Shiyan and Fijun support
[SPEAKER_04]: me to do the experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I learned a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Michigan group support me a lot
for genotyping and do the QTA analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Luis helped me to get the
G-Polida data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without her support, I could not
complete this research project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kris Sinek, she's a software
developer.
[SPEAKER_04]: She developed the Tetraverse neural net.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she supports a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of American researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, she stayed in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she frequently visits the US and
communicates with many American
[SPEAKER_04]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she also helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Jeffrey Enderman helped me to do
the GWAS analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So finally, I appreciate the whole Cornell
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was not like a super smart
student when I came to here first.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Cornell community changed me a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I go to the conference,
I have a really, how can I say this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like I'm really competitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's quite a funny story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Cornell community is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can guarantee that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions for Jay?
No question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd ask a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have covered this in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things which is a
reservation I have in use as a marker to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick out H1 resistance is that the Ernie I
was in the primary concern about a primary
[SPEAKER_02]: gene or species that was used in the
breeding program for IK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a major effort on Ernie I
resistance before the H1 gene was
[SPEAKER_02]: identified in the indigenous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of clones that are but we
were using the bio test for resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked out resistance, and we did not
know whether it was Ernie I.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just from the time and simplicity,
H1 was dominated still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm afraid that when we scroll away on
the marker, those that do not have H1 that
[SPEAKER_02]: are resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without doing a bio test on the
susceptible clones for H1, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in absence of H1, we won't pick them out
and then wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now maybe I didn't realize unless all
the I's were on the H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: H1 gene originates from the Solanum
indigena, especially CPC 1673 something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So according to my knowledge at least,
almost all breeding programs use this
[SPEAKER_04]: specific clone, Solanum indigena.
[SPEAKER_04]: CPC 1673.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the H1 gene that we have also
came from indigena.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you told me, S.
[SPEAKER_04]: bernia, there's another wild protest.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also known to have H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the case four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the case four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I cannot clearly explain what
happened in these clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Walter and I were discussing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We suppose that maybe, because as I
mentioned before, as fertility also has an
[SPEAKER_04]: R1 resistance, according to the one
European report.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe another resistance is located in
another chromosome affect the R1
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eva has, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that Eva has H1 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: But interestingly, this was negative for
CPC 1673.
The plan is that you can test those at all
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark will be the first to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cell phone will test those at all
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our current practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to use markers to put a lot of
screens we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically, although surely
negative for both markers, we will do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
So can
[SPEAKER_03]: you talk about how much variance you can
explain with the specific QTLs you
[SPEAKER_03]: identified?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you try to use all the markers for your
progression model and saying that how much
[SPEAKER_03]: you can use the whole marker, whole marker
set?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, generally, I like that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, technically, we can calculate
for each marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it takes a lot of time, frankly
speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the software,
[SPEAKER_04]: the TetraPolymer software always provide
QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, he asked about did I calculate
percent of variance explained for each
[SPEAKER_04]: marker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can say, I want to say that I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me explain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the TetraPolymer software always
provide the most significant QTL picks for
[SPEAKER_04]: each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once I put the appropriate genetic
genotype data and the phenotype data,
[SPEAKER_04]: this number and where it is located
automatically showed up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you really want to,
calculate other position, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to know how much this area
explain percent of variance explained,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to make like a linear model for
taking out some clones which has alleles
[SPEAKER_04]: related to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you keep all population to
calculate this one, the software does not
[SPEAKER_04]: show percent of variance explained for
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The area always shows the most significant
QTL picks only.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to explain all the long story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to develop a linear model and
then figure out which clones are related
[SPEAKER_04]: to this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not related to this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you find the clones related to
this one, you have to take it out from the
[SPEAKER_04]: population genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to rerun the whole QTL
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really complicating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, 24 is extremely high whenever I do
the QTL analysis for other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guarantee the other area has a really
small percent of variance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost ignorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just predict for another area,
you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe the genotype data, first the user
is like a kind of a phenotype data,
[SPEAKER_04]: you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your comments is really useful as well
as it's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to emphasize that I work
in a potato breeding especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a specific breeding purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are only interested in the position
which is most related to the target trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though maybe other area would be
related, would explain, a small amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: variance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the breeding purpose, both are
ignorable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just focus on the two significant
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
