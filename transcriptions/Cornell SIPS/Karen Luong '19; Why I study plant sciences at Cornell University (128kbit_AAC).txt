[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Karen Long, and I'm a
transfer junior at the School of
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated Plant Sciences, also known as
SIPPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly interested in studying plant
pathology, and that interest started in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school, where I took many
agricultural classes, including
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my horticulture class, two graduate
students at the New York State Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment Station came in with rotting
fruit and veggies and diseased plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they taught my class how to identify
common diseases in plants and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senior year, I had the opportunity of
interning at the experiment station with
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathologists for a couple of days,
and I ran basic tests like gel
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophoresis, I learned how to sequence
DNA, and even inoculated beans with white
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to the plant pathologists about
why doing research is important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they told me that they do research to
recommend disease management practices for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're part of the solution for food
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since that day, I've decided to
pursue a career in plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always wanted to come to Cornell,
probably because my agriculture teacher is
[SPEAKER_00]: an alumna, and I've done internships at
the station, and the researchers I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: under are both professors at SIPPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've influenced my decision to come
study here, but I went to community
[SPEAKER_00]: college first for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my transition from community
college to SIPPS has been really smooth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I appreciate how the plant sciences
program here includes a wide array of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, like plant pathology,
and the courses within the concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very specific, like fungal
genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a plant science student,
I'm able to take courses in other
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, like plant genetics and
breeding, and sustainable plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the faculty and students here at
SIPPS are supportive and collaborative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's many research opportunities
here on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in plant science,
I highly encourage you to see what SIPPS
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cornell has to offer.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
