[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome again to the NASCA 2011 Winter
Webinar Series.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that you found these webinars to
be interesting and informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: This webinar is the last one in the series
for 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our speakers today are Dr. James Lamondia,
who's going to be talking about nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and root rots, and Dr. Richard Cowles,
who will be discussing advances in root
[SPEAKER_01]: weevil management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are from the Kinnick Agricultural
Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few housekeeping things before we
start, if you're interested in viewing the
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded webinars, if you look in the web
links box over here, you'll see webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that, you'll see a URL
appears in the browse to box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click on that and it will open in a
window behind this window and all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded webinars will be there for you to
access later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is we're interested in
having some feedback from you about the
[SPEAKER_01]: series, and so we have a short five
question online survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will help us determine the
effectiveness of this type of program,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you liked about it, what you may not
have liked about it, and then possible
[SPEAKER_01]: topics of interest for a future series
hosted by NASCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you click again in the web link box
on the exit survey, you'll find the URL
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you can just browse there and it
should take you maybe five minutes at the
[SPEAKER_01]: most to complete the survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of NASCA and their hosting of the
winter webinar series, we wish to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you very much, NASCA, for hosting the
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some membership information
for you that we hope you'll look through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you consider joining an
association like NASCA?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the membership benefits to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a membership application blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are in the file share box in the
bottom right side of your screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have some people registering even
today for this last webinar, and so I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just give a brief reminder of the options
that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in commenting or
asking a question in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen, you'll see what's called the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can type in that long white box
and then it either hit the little dialogue
[SPEAKER_01]: icon or hit enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be posted to everyone who's
participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up on the top of your screen, you see a
little icon of a person with their hand
[SPEAKER_01]: raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several options under that drop
down menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could agree or disagree with a comment
that the speaker's making.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask them to speak louder or
softer, to slow up or go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say something funny, you can pick
the smiley face for laughter and clapping
[SPEAKER_01]: hands for applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I believe we're ready to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first speaker today is Dr. James
Lamondia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim is a plant pathologist, nematologist,
and the chief scientist at the Connecticut
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture Experiment Station Valley
Laboratory in Windsor, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim earned his BS in biology from
Fitchburg State College in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_01]: and MS and PhD degrees in plant pathology
from Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: His research interests are biology and
control of plant diseases caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Areas of emphasis include nonchemical
control such as plant resistance and
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim has 25 years of experience researching
strawberry diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very fortunate to have Jim with us
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me, Kathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk about are these
nematodes and root rots that occur on
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often strawberry root diseases,
whether they're nematodes or fungi or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, we sort of come at this
because the plants are doing poorly or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dying and we really don't see
anything visible on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to find out is what are
the problems and then how do we deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is talk about some
of these root rots and then talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and then talk about black root
rot, whether it's a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and fungi, and just then how we
can try to deal with some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most common ones are probably red steel,
pythium, and black root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through those sort of in order
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have lesion nematodes and
root knot nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root knot on strawberries,
particularly in the Northeast and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, temperate areas, or myelodigine
hapli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because disease really doesn't
occur on its own, in a vacuum we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider the environmental effects of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stresses to the plants that can increase
disease, such as compaction, too much or
[SPEAKER_00]: too little water, stressful pHs,
and then nutrient too much or too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that all kind of comes into
this disease triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever a plant pathologist gives a talk,
we're required to show this slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have a susceptible plant rather
than a resistant type, a causal agent,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the pathogen that we're trying to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease always doesn't occur on pure
cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the environment that the plant
and the pathogen are interacting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to the first disease, red steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms of this, and the symptoms of
most of these root diseases, as I said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, are just sort of poor vigor,
the tops are dying back, stunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are under stress and having
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diagnosis is something we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under cool conditions, when you dig
these plants up and look at them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find red vascular tissue,
which is where the common name red steel
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a little later in the summer,
about harvest time, as it's warming,
[SPEAKER_00]: often that symptom disappears and you just
see sort of a rat tail root rot symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathogen has persisted in the soil
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, under the right conditions,
you can see this reddish vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just sort of peel this back with
your thumbnail or sometimes with a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can notice that the cortex here is
nice and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular tissue is where the disease
is occurring and it's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the bottom left here, you can see
this oospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the reason why this pathogen
can be persistent in the soil for years
[SPEAKER_00]: and years, even in the absence of a host.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are thick walled resting spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a water mold that produces these
oospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sexually produced spore and they
can persist under tough conditions for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's present in the field,
you can count on it almost always being
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, water molds produce multiple kinds of
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce those resting spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the long term type of spore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also produce sporangia, which can act
as a let me show you right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this sporangia here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a lemon shaped spore that
can act almost like a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can germinate directly under conditions
where there's an excess of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil pores are flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often re-differentiate and produce
zoospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that I have the little
black arrows here as well pointing at
[SPEAKER_00]: zoospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at, use your imagination
here, you can imagine that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple, lots of zoospores swimming
around in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these actually have flagella and they
can swim and they chemically are attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: to strawberry roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can imagine under wet
conditions, flooded conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of a single sporangium that's
germinating and causing disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a little cluster bomb effect where
now you've got 20 to 40 zoospores that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of this and then swim through the
flooded soil pores attracted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons why flooded
conditions are so damaging for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's a water mold, severe under
wet conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things we can do about this
are to improve drainage, grow plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: raised beds, tile fields, do whatever
needs to be done, avoid compaction in plow
[SPEAKER_00]: pans, which can also increase flooding in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed a few here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the Cornell information,
there's a lot of different places where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at different varieties and
varieties will have some level of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to Phytophthora fergari.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, some of the fungicides may
help reduce disease in combination with
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance or environmental changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to rely only on fungicides
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the fungicides are Alliette type,
Ritamil, and then the phosphorous acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another water mold that can attack the
roots is Pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that occurs in a lot of
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different species
probably that even attack strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common in many soils all over North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here are these large
numbers of these old spores again in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the symptoms of Pythium root rot are
sort of a watery rot of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend not to be as dramatic as the
Phytophthora, pardon me, as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora fergari or even as a black
root rot, which we'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be more root nibbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take out the fine feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, under cool, wet conditions,
stressed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the same management tactics
that you can use for Phytophthora fergari
[SPEAKER_00]: also apply to Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving drainage, reducing compaction,
growing on beds, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the same fungicides may
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to talk a little bit about some
of the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these nematode problems on
strawberries I think are often
[SPEAKER_00]: under-recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northern root-knot nematode
mulletagine haplua is more common,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, than people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes galls on roots, but these galls
sometimes are fairly short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here these are actually
clusters of multiple galls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here has probably five or six
different galls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this larger area in this
sort of quadrant here, there's probably 25
[SPEAKER_00]: galls in this cluster of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also cause roots to branch more
commonly than they would normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get these hairy root symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the galls for Northern root-knot
nematode are much smaller than those that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see in the books for the Southern
root-knot nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the large galls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pictures on tomatoes and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to be fairly small,
and because strawberry roots can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little woodier, they're even smaller on
strawberries, not as obvious as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: on some other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nematodes are plant parasitic
roundworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northern root-knot nematode is one
that is called an endoparasite,
[SPEAKER_00]: sedentary endoparasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eggs, you can see here,
that develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to get the pointer at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop into juveniles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The juveniles go into the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause the root to establish feeding
cells, which act as transfer cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they're the same kind of cells
that pump nutrients into fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except in this case, they're taking the
nutrients and giving it to the nematode
[SPEAKER_00]: upon which it feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they increase in size
fairly dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a juvenile here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they increase in size to these large
females, which are essentially egg-laying
[SPEAKER_00]: machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through several molts,
and then the females produce an egg mass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about the same size as the females,
so they're very fecund.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to infect at the root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see multiple juveniles stained
red here, and the root tip on the inset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the root tip itself tends to stop
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets swollen, and as a result of that,
you often get branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get these little areas where you
get varistems being produced and branching
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out, hence the hairy root symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, as the root continues to grow,
you can get multiple females being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced from what once was the root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a female actually inside the
root here, another one over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then two more on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this area is the egg mass that's being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look again at the inset here,
you have this white, creamy colored
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the head end down here at the very
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then underneath is the egg mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is several hundred eggs,
which when you think about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's producing more eggs than her own
body mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned haplua tends to be more
common than we realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It infects a lot of agronomic crops,
almost all vegetables, small fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like soybean, clover, a lot of
broadleaf weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more common ones are the
purslane, plantain, dandelion,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you can read here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all grain crops are non-hosts for
myelodogon haplua.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us an idea of what we can do
for rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibility there is to rotate with a
grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things when we try to get
rid of these nematodes with grain crops is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's often difficult to get all the
strawberry crowns out of the field or the
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those hosts of the nematode
continue to survive in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be a source of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these nematodes increase so
quickly because they produce so many eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can be difficult if you don't get
these out to control by rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, finally, fumigation,
but that's getting to be tougher and
[SPEAKER_00]: tougher to do as more regulations come in
and make it harder to fumigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesion nematode is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most common nematode in
the Northeast in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protolankus penetrans is the one we see
the most This is a vermiform nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a migratory endoparasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not produce the large females like
the rootnod does.
[SPEAKER_00]: These go into the roots, migrate through
the cortex, and cause lesions like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this happens to be a soybean root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these chocolate brown
lesions where the nematode has moved
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybean is actually a pretty good
indicator of nematode infection in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use this for a bioassay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I worked at the Georgia Bio
Survey at Cornell was done, is using these
[SPEAKER_00]: as a way for growers to evaluate the level
of lesion nematodes in their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be something that we can talk
about in the future at some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these nematodes also go inside the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They migrate through the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the juveniles and the
adults stained red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see the eggs that they lay as
they move along.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce egg masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just lay them as they go in the roots
or in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they move, they cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding on the cell contents and
moving through the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nematodes, as I mentioned,
are very common in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can attack almost every plant you can
think of, in many respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 550 species of agronomic crops and
weeds, and there's probably more that we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't looked at yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the grain crops that you're growing
for control of Moedigine haplua are almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all hosts for Pridolanus penetrans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do need to know what the nematode
problem is before you try to control it by
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to talk a little bit about what
these nematodes do in terms of other than
[SPEAKER_00]: direct damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are involved in another root rot
disease called black root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that has a complex cause,
multiple organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, the most common one is the fungal
problem that causes the root rot is this
[SPEAKER_00]: binucleate rhizoctonia, rhizoctonia
frigiri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with a cortical root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some pictures of that in
a second here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the lesion nematodes and stress
also increase disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, the symptoms of this are pretty
nondescript, and hence the common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decline over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you have a field in production
in strawberries, the more likely it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a problem with a black root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be clicking two here at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you dig these plants up,
you can see that the plant on the left has
[SPEAKER_00]: root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see black roots, actually fewer
roots as well compared to the healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on the right, or healthier plant on
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at those, look more
closely at those roots, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a cortical root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pathogen is causing the cortex to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you slice that open, you can
differentiate between this and a disease
[SPEAKER_00]: like red steel, because now the cortex is
dying and turning black and rotting,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming just away, sometimes again with a
similar rat tail type of symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the vascular tissue,
it remains white for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now eventually, that's all going to die,
and the roots just rot away and disappear,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn mushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the pathogen that causes
the root rot symptom is this rhizoctonia
[SPEAKER_00]: frigeri, very similar to the rhizoc on
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's a binucleate rather than
multinucleate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different anastomosis
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see I have a chart here of what
happens when we did experiments in growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers, looking at different isolates of
the pathogen fungus, rhizoctonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the anastomosis groups A, G,
and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to differ a little bit in their
pathogenicity and how they do at certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's no scale here,
but the three boxes across the front are
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have just the rhizoctonia alone,
with no nematodes, the zero here,
[SPEAKER_00]: or with a low level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under these conditions, we're getting
25, 30, 40 percent root rot or a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what we would consider to be
damaging levels of lesion nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind we see mostly in the populations
that we would see in the field that are
[SPEAKER_00]: causing stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So root rot goes from 30 to 35 percent
here to about 70 to 80 percent when we add
[SPEAKER_00]: the lesion nematodes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do interact and increase the
amount of disease caused by the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the effects that we're seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did other experiments here that,
again, no pathogens, none.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizoctonia figarii alone or the
rhizoctonia plus pridomycus penetrans,
[SPEAKER_00]: the PP.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, again, black root rot
increases, even 10 percent with none.
[SPEAKER_00]: There probably is some rhizoctonia in the
none.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sometimes difficult to get
strawberries with absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonia figarii.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where we have the pathogen,
where we have inoculated, we get 22
[SPEAKER_00]: percent root rot, more than double it when
we have the rhizoctonia in combination
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to visible disease that
we're seeing on the roots, we see reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: length both in structural roots and in
feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots that are rotting tend to
disappear and we have a smaller root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, that smaller root system,
not so healthy root system, results in a
[SPEAKER_00]: decline in this lack of vigor and
debilitating decline in the strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to talk about the root rot,
I think we also need to talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: root types we're talking about with
strawberry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about structural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have both primary and secondary
tissues with a well-developed cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structural roots are the roots that
you get when the larger roots that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: with a transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are going into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have perennial roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plants that are a couple of years
old have very woody roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are primarily, these are mostly
secondary tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are woody tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no root cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been sloughed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have feeder roots that can come
off these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both structural roots and perennial
roots have these soft primary tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: By primary, I mean non-woody tissues that
are these feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are pretty short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the literature, they talk about
some of the feeder roots cycling through
[SPEAKER_00]: about every two weeks or so, which seems
very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having trouble here with moving one at
a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the structural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they are these white
tissues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have the feeder roots coming
off them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do a cross section of this,
you can see that we have a root with the
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular tissue, a root cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the epidermis on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cross section of the feeder
roots, pardon me, these structural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those structure roots, over time,
produce these secondary woody tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have vascular tissue on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what this black arrow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting secondary growth on the
inside of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woody tissue in the cortex is to the
left or to the outside of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now over time, those roots will develop
into these perennial roots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, they're black roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often people think they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you slice those open, they're nice
and white inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have functional feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they are healthy, they will
continue to be valuable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we take those perennial roots and
cut them open, you can see it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like cutting open a tree trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have very woody tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the vascular tissue,
the xylem in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this black area on the outside is what
used to be the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as that secondary tissue grows from the
inside out, it cuts off the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it essentially dies and is sloughed
off and becomes this black outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the feeder roots that occur on
both of these are very soft tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: No woody growth in them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the roots cycle over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get an increase in roots till about the
time the plant's fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to go down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably as a result of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then come back again in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we further split that up,
you can see the green areas here are the
[SPEAKER_00]: white structural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, go down during fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they remain healthy,
we'll turn into the black perennial roots
[SPEAKER_00]: with the yellow circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increase over time again in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the white structure roots
coming back again in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are the nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: The nematodes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause these lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause a collapse, which causes that
in the carotid spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there are areas here where
nematodes have moved right through the
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move through the cells, feeding on
the contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cells die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the phenolics and the
discoloration that occurs around them and
[SPEAKER_00]: in those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, that leads to this lesion where
you get multiple cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes have probably moved through
these cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then around this, that tissue dies and
then seemingly the rhizectonia moves into
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in addition to directly damaging
cells, in the literature, and we've also
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, we get discoloration of the
endodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ring that occurs around the vascular
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the secondary growth starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes discolored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to be, again, like it was cut
open, like the phenolics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get early secondary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants recognize that they're being
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce perennial roots,
or at least part of that root system,
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are the nematodes in the root
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few are in the perennial roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are obligate parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need living tissue on which to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those woody roots are tough for them to
get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do occur in perennial roots,
it's probably in the feeder roots that are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a higher number in the
structural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then very common in the feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have decent roots, most of those
nematodes are not going to be in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be in the structure
roots, or the feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us what kind of roots we
should be taking if we're doing sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine if we have nematodes in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, when do we sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mentioned these are obligate
parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need root tissue on which to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about what happens to the root
tissue over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It peaks in late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or so, and then starts to decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nematode populations do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mirror the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the roots are declining and dying,
the nematodes either population crashes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they move off into the soil and become
tougher to get back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the peaks are just before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us not only where do we need
to sample the feeder roots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure roots, but when, late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhizectonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one, the organism that causes
black root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets into the cortex, digests that
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the monilioid cells here in
the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the organism that causes the
actual rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily in the perennial roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that sloughed cortex, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this in either in the
spring or, again, after harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: late June or so, in the spring,
most of the rhizectonia that we isolated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we took an entire root systems and cut
them up into little two millimeter root
[SPEAKER_00]: sections and plated these all out and
counted the percent infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than half of the perennial roots were
infected with rhizectonia frigariae
[SPEAKER_00]: initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little in the structural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeder roots are even in what seem to be
lesion nematode areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as those plants go through harvest,
they're stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of infection of perennial roots
goes very high, as do the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection where lesion nematodes are
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look at what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did some experiments where we
did split roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took strawberry crowns and split the
root system in two so that we had half the
[SPEAKER_00]: root system in part one, half in the
second pot, and then inoculated either
[SPEAKER_00]: with both pathogens in different pots,
both in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot here, or only the nematodes or only
the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to give you a visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either had the pathogens together or
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happened for disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we had the most disease was where we
had both pathogens in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When both pathogens were present at the
same level but in different sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root system, we did not have as much
disease and it was actually the same as if
[SPEAKER_00]: we had only one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems as though it is not a systemic
effect, but a localized effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the rhizoctonia for Gary
seems to be resident on strawberry roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of sampling and a lot of
strawberries over many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common on the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can find plants that are healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have rhizoctonia on them,
mostly on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, again, on the perennial roots,
but not necessarily causing disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see secondary growth starting and
the cortex dying, we get increased
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonia infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see nematode lesions, we get
increased rhizoctonia infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the same is true with
environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of cases where
environmental stress increases black root
[SPEAKER_00]: rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, root stress, problems with the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the lesion nematodes doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause this root damage directly by
their feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That results in wounded tissue that's
probably more susceptible to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also results in roots producing early
secondary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have limited areas in the root
system where the secondary growth occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parts of the cortex are being cut
off and then they're senescing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where the rhizoctonia
moves in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The areas of the root that have this dying
cortex that's the start and it moves from
[SPEAKER_00]: there into what would otherwise be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lesion nematodes, how common are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did a survey in Connecticut a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the growers thought that they had
damaging populations of lesion nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that, most of those either fumigated,
used a nematocyte like Nemacur or
[SPEAKER_00]: Fyridine, which was labeled at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes did both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other 75% either didn't think they
had a problem or were unaware that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or said, what's a lesion nematode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lesion nematodes, we might actually
went out and surveyed those fields after
[SPEAKER_00]: we did the analysis of asking the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found them in 31 of the 41 fields we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of the growers that had no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of those fumigated with methyl
bromide and or telone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surprised that they actually thought
they had damaging problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe had in the past, but four of those
fields, three of the fields didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any nematodes at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers that were aware of the problem
and others that were even unaware,
[SPEAKER_00]: three that thought they had problems and
eight that were unaware that didn't manage
[SPEAKER_00]: all had damaging lesion nematode
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're much more common than people
realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't recognize the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, again, not surprising because
there are no obvious symptoms other than
[SPEAKER_00]: lesions, which can be tough to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things we found in our
surveys is the people who rotated,
[SPEAKER_00]: often with small grains, this did not
affect the lesion nematode populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually made it, in some cases,
probably worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the impacts of nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had done some work looking at what
nematodes do to reduce yields and found
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we adapted a model developed at
Cornell by Demery and Reichenberg,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are no nematodes, this is 98
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a profit of nearly $8,000 per
acre over four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start getting up into damaging
levels, which would be somewhere where we
[SPEAKER_00]: consider about 100 nematodes per gram of
root as damaging, you can see we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: really significant loss in profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start getting above damaging
levels, we actually had to predict a loss
[SPEAKER_00]: over four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not something that anybody
wants to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we manage black root rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, it had been done with
fumigation, broad-spectrum fumigants,
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl bromide, Orlex, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is becoming more difficult or
impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of times in
recommendations to use rotation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the question is with what and for how
long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanitation, planting clean crowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some work with fertilizers,
and ammonia was better than nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, but gave us about 10%
reduction, and then control of lesion
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tried to do some work with
fungicides, seeing if we could use a dip
[SPEAKER_00]: or a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, rhizoctonia frigidae is pretty
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can even be found in healthy crowns
from nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought if we could break that
association, that would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a bunch, looked at a number of
different fungicides, and then isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also evaluated on auger plates to see
if we saw inhibition in media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that some had activity,
some in vitro, meaning in the plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: some on the plants, but at this point,
more work needs to be done to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what we might be able to use to be more
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the newer fungicides we need
to test again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Rich will talk a little more
about this, but we've been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance or tolerance to black root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one possibility, and there are some
varieties that seem to be more affected
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think he will speak to this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what do we grow and for how
long?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look here, this is a graph of
reproductive factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final population over the initial,
so it's essentially an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it multiply over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hairy vetch increases by seven times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start off with 100 nematodes,
probably end up with 700 over one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mustard actually increases, rapeseed,
two and a half times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start getting down into sorghum
sudangrass, like Trudanate, and down into
[SPEAKER_00]: ryegrass, we get less of an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not only do we have to just grow
these plants, but if you can grow them as
[SPEAKER_00]: a green manure and incorporate them,
some of these plants produce chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be toxic to the nematodes,
allelopathic, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hairy vetch obviously doesn't have
these properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great host for lesion nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As is alfalfa, some of the grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start getting down to the
sudex, the sorghum sudangrass,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rapeseed, ryegrass, and mustard,
you can see that the populations are not
[SPEAKER_00]: as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do get a biofumigation or
allelopathic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition, we've been working on,
there's a Canadian Forge pearl millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some work here at the Valley
Laboratory looking at buckwheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: dwarf Essex brassica, which is one that
was a high glucosinolate used for
[SPEAKER_00]: biofumigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delvid bean was used down south,
and then sorghum sudangrass, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this Canadian Forge pearl millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that the sudangrass
and the millet actually had the best
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy for green manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better even than the dwarf Essex
brassica, which supposedly is a
[SPEAKER_00]: biofumigant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it's also a host of the
nematodes, so that it can increase it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root system, and then when you chop it
down and turn it under, you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: knock down a population you just
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I think I will stop,
and Kathy, do we have any time for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have time for a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich is asking, Jim, that you would
explain anastomosis group to the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: listening.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ryzactonia has these different
anastomosis groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anastomosis is fusion, so these are wide
groups that are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what the Ryzactonia does is
it recognizes other isolates as itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will fuse hyphae and exchange
genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have very similar isolates,
they are in the same anastomosis group,
[SPEAKER_00]: these hyphae fuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are different enough that they no
longer recognize each other, they're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different anastomosis group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way of saying related
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other questions for Jim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when I use the term radish,
is that oilseed radish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have been doing some work with
oilseed radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this in microplots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's underway, and I can't really speak
as to how well that's working yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Jim, and you can think about
questions for Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be back with us at the end of the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next speaker is Dr. Richard Cowles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich obtained his degrees in entomology
from Cornell and Michigan State
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: After completion of his doctoral degree,
he worked for four years as statewide
[SPEAKER_01]: extension and research turf and ornamental
specialist at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: California, Riverside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Rich has been a research
entomologist at the Connecticut
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Experiment Station,
and is also stationed at the Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: Laboratory in Windsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: His areas of study include managing
pyrethroid resistance, use of systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticides, integrated pest management,
and breeding strawberries for resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: to black root rot and black vine weevils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me switch to your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to do a little adjustment here
first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can everybody hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of an overview for my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go over the life cycle for root
weevils and go over some field
[SPEAKER_05]: observations for how these root weevils
damage strawberry plantings, and I'll go
[SPEAKER_05]: into some practical approaches to manage
root weevils and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a number of species of importance
throughout the United States, of which
[SPEAKER_05]: black vine weevil is present across the
country, along with some of the smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: root weevil species.
[SPEAKER_05]: The strawberry root weevil and rough
strawberry root weevil are found
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the country, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black vine weevil is about half an inch
long in body length.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a black vine weevil, whereas the
strawberry root weevil and rough
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry root weevil are about half that
size.
[SPEAKER_05]: The leaf weevil is a brilliant green
color, and unlike the Odiorhynchus
[SPEAKER_05]: species, which are the black vine weevil
and these other strawberry and rough
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry root weevil, the leaf weevil,
which is bright green, reproduces
[SPEAKER_05]: sexually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in the Pacific Northwest,
there may also be other root weevils,
[SPEAKER_05]: which thankfully we don't have in New
England, such as a clay-colored weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The life cycle of black vine weevil,
if you were to go out right now probably
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere in the country, you'd find
overwintering pupae and also overwintering
[SPEAKER_05]: adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black vine weevil and all of the root
weevils pretty much are long-lived,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the adults can live for more than one
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is of great concern because sometimes
those weevils that are overwintering as
[SPEAKER_05]: adults may start feeding and laying eggs
far ahead of the generation that emerges
[SPEAKER_05]: during the summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you should have mostly overwintering
pupae, and when the soil temperatures...
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the pupae here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the soil temperatures reach about 55
degrees Fahrenheit, that triggers
[SPEAKER_05]: development of the overwintering... Excuse
me, the larvae are overwintering over
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the soil temperatures reach about 55
degrees Fahrenheit, that triggers them to
[SPEAKER_05]: develop to the intermediate stage of the
pupae, where they complete development and
[SPEAKER_05]: emerge at about the time that there are
strawberries starting to ripen in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: The adults feed extensively on the edges
of the leaves for about three to four
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks, at which time they are able then to
start laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eggs are initially white, and within a few
days they develop to this yellowish-brown
[SPEAKER_05]: color, which indicates that they're
developing properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This feeding along the edges of the
strawberry leaves is especially important
[SPEAKER_05]: for...
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for a number of reasons,
one of which is that it provides a very
[SPEAKER_05]: excellent way for you to go out and
monitor in your fields to determine where
[SPEAKER_05]: you have black vine weevil infestations,
or any of the other root weevils will
[SPEAKER_05]: cause the same sort of leaf notching.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing of concern with the
feeding activity is that where you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of feeding, that implies that the
weevils will be able to convert that
[SPEAKER_05]: foliage into eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at this particular field,
in this area right here, we had fixed set
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the grower went through and renovated
by mowing off the foliage in that
[SPEAKER_05]: particular field, that was at the time
when the weevils were just about ready to
[SPEAKER_05]: start laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine the season before,
they mowed the foliage, they could not mow
[SPEAKER_05]: where there was this irrigation because of
the risers, they couldn't take the mower
[SPEAKER_05]: over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the weevils from the entire field were
then concentrated right where the
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation pipe was.
[SPEAKER_05]: They continued feeding, started laying
their eggs where the foliage was still
[SPEAKER_05]: present in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they moved outward from that
site.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in looking across the field,
I could see in the fall these rows of
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries where the pipes were turning
red, and there was less damage,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there was a very strong gradient from
that particular row and across the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next irrigation pipe would
look just the same as this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where you have extremely tasty foliage
available to the adults, that's where they
[SPEAKER_05]: will be feeding and that's where they will
be laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then consequently, that's where root
damage will be occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: The leaf notching within the field is a
very useful measure.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did with surveys is that we went
throughout Connecticut and we took samples
[SPEAKER_05]: of 100 leaves in every strawberry field
that we could find, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the 100 leaf sample at random,
and then we sat down and we counted the
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of those leaves that had any
signs of notching, which presumably would
[SPEAKER_05]: be from root weevil adult feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the numbers of fields that had a
certain percent of leaf notching then
[SPEAKER_05]: formed this histogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a large number of fields with 50
percent or less notching.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a few fields that were very severely
affected, these are ones in which the
[SPEAKER_05]: growers would have seen extreme damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there was only one field out of
the total of something like 42 fields or
[SPEAKER_05]: so, there was only one field out of the 18
in this histogram that had no signs of any
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf notching.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it tells me that black vine weevil
infestations through fields in Connecticut
[SPEAKER_05]: are widespread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Practically every field of strawberries
will have some root weevil activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extremely rare to find any field that
has no root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are only about a quarter of the
fields that have infestations heavy enough
[SPEAKER_05]: to require doing some sort of management.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in doing our surveys, we found that
there were considerable varietal
[SPEAKER_05]: differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So certain varieties such as All-Star or
Annapolis would be looking pretty good,
[SPEAKER_05]: and yet neighboring varieties such as Kent
or Honey Oye would be destroyed by black
[SPEAKER_03]: vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: This led to rather an intensive project in
comparing commercial strawberry varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: to see whether there was genetic variation
that would allow growers to plant
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties that had some level of
resistance to root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the methods that I used was to take
leaf discs from different varieties of
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries that was just punched out
with a cork borer, place them in a petri
[SPEAKER_05]: dish with weevil, and then allow the
weevils to feed overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the things that contribute to
variation in the palatability of
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries to black vine weevil are the
degree of how many leaf hairs they have,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there are other features of the
strawberry leaves too.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there are quite major differences
among strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many different types of
strawberry varieties in their palatability
[SPEAKER_05]: to black vine weevil, and this can be an
important thing to use for finding
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another aspect that I looked at was to see
whether the root systems for these
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry varieties differed in how well
they would support black vine weevil
[SPEAKER_05]: larval development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of the 21 cultivars that I looked at,
there was no variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The larvae developed equivalently on all
21 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really the foliage differences
that are leading to variations that we see
[SPEAKER_05]: in the field and damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not to say that root
characteristics aren't important,
[SPEAKER_05]: though, related to survival of the
strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the way to look at this is
that there are very likely interactions
[SPEAKER_05]: with root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we have cultivars that are
susceptible to black root rot and have,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a consequence of root rot, very few
roots, functional roots, those are
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties then that cannot tolerate
additional root weevil feeding on those
[SPEAKER_05]: root systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plants simply then collapse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we wish to have a program in which
we're using plant resistance, we need to
[SPEAKER_05]: have a breeding program in which we
jointly improve root disease and root
[SPEAKER_05]: weevil tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea here being that if we can have a
strawberry plant that grows really
[SPEAKER_05]: extensive root systems, that they'll be
able to tolerate both black root rot and
[SPEAKER_05]: black vine weevil or other root weevil
larval feeding without compromising the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of the plant to obtain sufficient
water, nutrients, and then be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide a good crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So black root rot is important because
even though weevil feeding doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: increase black root rot incidence,
black root rot will remove the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: root tissue that's functions, and it
increases the injuriousness of additional
[SPEAKER_03]: root loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, both genes Jim and I did screening
trials with commercial varieties of
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries to see what the variation was
amongst them for susceptibility to root
[SPEAKER_05]: rots and to root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was able to determine that the leaf
hair and nitrogen characteristics would
[SPEAKER_05]: affect feeding, and there were some other
factors involved too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea being that behind my breeding
program has been to hybridize the superior
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties that would have both some
tolerance of black vine weevil and some
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerance to root rots to permit
directional selection to improve the
[SPEAKER_05]: favorable traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can think about this in terms of
animal breeding, where we had ancestrally
[SPEAKER_05]: something like a wolf, and selective
breeding for a larger size animal would
[SPEAKER_05]: lead to the Great Dane, and selection for
a smaller animal leads to a chihuahua,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they started with the same ancestry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could do the same sort of process
with selective breeding with strawberries
[SPEAKER_05]: by simply planting those strawberries in
an environment where there is extreme root
[SPEAKER_05]: disease presence, and then only taking
those survivors that fruit well and using
[SPEAKER_05]: them as parents for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using this approach, we've come up with a
variety that's shown on the left called
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubicon that should be released probably
in 2012.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's named now and it is undergoing
patenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from our own breeding program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another variety that comes
from British Columbia from a cross made in
[SPEAKER_05]: 1994 called Stolo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the claim is that it is resistant
to black vine weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it will be very interesting to
compare these two new varieties to see how
[SPEAKER_05]: well they perform where there's a high
degree of root disease and black vine
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils.
[SPEAKER_03]: For managing root weevils, there are
really two or three major approaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start out with biological control,
of which really the only commercial ized
[SPEAKER_05]: tool that's been tested has been the use
of insect pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll mention predatory ground beetles as
we proceed because there are some other
[SPEAKER_05]: practices that may impact their
effectiveness in suppressing black vine
[SPEAKER_05]: weevil populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Insect pathogenic nematodes, there are a
number of species available.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are ones that are principally active
in searching out hosts near the surface of
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be Steinunuma coprocapsi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are other species that dig
deeply in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They move through the soil on a water film
on the soil particles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heterorhabditis species are the commercial
varieties that dig deeper into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of advantages in
working with nematodes, one of which is
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're exempt from pesticide
regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're a multicellular organism,
they're not really considered to be
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're extremely safe to the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't cause pollution of any sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more importantly, I think,
they're able to seek out their hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They move on their own to where the host
is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're also able to multiply in the
host.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could have permanent establishment
of these insect pathogenic nematodes in
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil that then would lead to
suppression of the weevil populations over
[SPEAKER_05]: a long period of time, multiple years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have an image of an effective
juvenile stage insect pathogenic nematode.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only about half a millimeter long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the stage of nematode that
would be purchased from a commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: provider.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are applied almost as you would
apply an insecticide to the field,
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigated in to incorporate the nematodes
and allow them to then move through the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil under their own power.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seek out the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they infect the host,
this is a cutlery pupa here, they will go
[SPEAKER_05]: through a few generations of development
within the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then will exit the host in extremely
large numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That next cycle of effective juvenile
nematodes can then go through the soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: cause additional cycles of infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the important things about these
nematodes that you need to understand is
[SPEAKER_05]: that they have mutualistic bacteria that
live within their guts.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the nematodes infect a soil dwelling
insect, one of the first things they do is
[SPEAKER_05]: that they release these bacteria into the
hemicele or the body cavity of that
[SPEAKER_05]: insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the bacteria multiply within the
insect's body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we have here is a Petri dish in
which there were the mutualistic bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: placed on the agar plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's showing that there is a zone of
inhibition meaning that those bacteria are
[SPEAKER_05]: producing antibiotics that protect inside
the insect, protect it from being
[SPEAKER_05]: colonized by fungi or anything else that
might compete with the ability of the
[SPEAKER_05]: nematodes to complete development.
[SPEAKER_05]: These bacteria can have distinctive
colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we look at black vine weevil
larvae that have been infected by insect
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogenic nematodes, they'll take on the
color of the bacteria, the bacterial
[SPEAKER_05]: mutualistic, mutualists that are found
with the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black vine weevil on the right was
infected with a Stein or Pneuma species.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one in the center was infected with a
heteroabdited nematode, which would cause
[SPEAKER_05]: the larva to turn a reddish or brownish
color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the larva on the right is a healthy
black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a few trials with insect
pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is showing the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an assessment in the fall of how many
larvae there were in a sample of two
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the dates that are given on the x-axis
are the dates of application for the
[SPEAKER_05]: insect pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So an early May application, when we came
back in October and checked, we had a very
[SPEAKER_05]: low number of larvae around those root
systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we progressed through field season to
June and then to August, the percent
[SPEAKER_05]: reduction of the larvae around the root
system compared to the untreated check was
[SPEAKER_03]: insignificant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The explanation I have for these dynamics
are as follows.
[SPEAKER_05]: That when we do an early May application
of nematodes, the significance of this
[SPEAKER_05]: arrow here is application of nematodes and
the timing, those overwintered larvae and
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps the pupae that are present in the
soil might be infected to the degree of 30
[SPEAKER_05]: to 40 percent of the population.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't do a whole lot for reducing
the black vine weevil population.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what it does do is allow the
nematodes to develop to the point where
[SPEAKER_05]: there will be infective juvenile nematodes
present in the soil at great large numbers
[SPEAKER_05]: when the next generation of eggs of the
weevils would be hatching.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there would be 90 percent or
greater infection of that population of
[SPEAKER_05]: weevil larvae in August or September.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guidelines for using insect
pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, you should make sure that the soil
is moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do apply nematodes, apply them with
any kind of liquid application spray
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest though, because nematodes
are very expensive, to use a boom sprayer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably band the nematodes onto the row
as narrow a band as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not use a piston pump because that
shears the nematodes and will kill them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can even apply irrigation
while spraying the nematodes to provide an
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to move the nematodes
immediately into the soil where they'd be
[SPEAKER_05]: protected from sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the great challenges is people
trying to apply these nematodes on a sunny
[SPEAKER_05]: day, nematodes will only survive for a
couple minutes in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typical guidelines are to apply about one
billion per treated acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, if you're banding them on,
that means that you might only be treating
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially half or one-third of the total
area of the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that you would only need to
buy proportionately that much many fewer
[SPEAKER_05]: nematodes to treat a field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, the results from various field
trials around the world has suggested that
[SPEAKER_05]: a fall application could even be more
effective than a spring application
[SPEAKER_05]: timing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in both instances, the soil
temperature needs to be greater than 60
[SPEAKER_05]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally speaking, the warmer the
soil, the better these nematodes will
[SPEAKER_05]: perform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only will the nematodes be able to
move through the soil faster at higher
[SPEAKER_05]: soil temperatures, but the bacteria that
are associated with the nematodes will
[SPEAKER_05]: multiply in the infected hosts much faster
with warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the multiplication of those
bacteria that actually kill the insect
[SPEAKER_05]: host.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done field sampling throughout
Connecticut and looking in growers' fields
[SPEAKER_05]: for the presence of insect pathogenic
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the surprises for me was to
compare fields in which nematodes had
[SPEAKER_05]: never been applied in which there were
eight fields where we found insect
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogenic nematodes and then 39 fields
that had none.
[SPEAKER_05]: And compare that to fields where we had
purposefully applied commercially
[SPEAKER_05]: available nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And about six fields out of eight or three
quarters of the fields, we were able to
[SPEAKER_05]: recover insect pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably one of the more important
messages here is that insect pathogenic
[SPEAKER_05]: nematodes are found in our soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're given an opportunity to
infect root weevils, they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can be an important way to
suppress weevil populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally speaking, commercial application
of commercially available insect
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogenic nematodes has been kind of
so-so in terms of suppression of weevil
[SPEAKER_05]: populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that there are a number of
problems, one of which is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: commercially available nematodes may be of
questionable quality compared to those
[SPEAKER_05]: populations that we find naturalized in
our soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, they're great if they're
already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of the requirements for warm
soils and there's really a great degree of
[SPEAKER_05]: interference if there's significant clay
content in the soil, there are very
[SPEAKER_05]: specific conditions under which these
nematodes can work well to suppress root
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally speaking, they've only been
mediocre.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we move on to chemical control,
there are basically two strategies.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember in the introduction for
this talk, I told you that black fly
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils will feed for about three to four
weeks before they are able to start laying
[SPEAKER_05]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been considered in the past to be
a great window of opportunity in which we
[SPEAKER_05]: might be able to kill the adults and
interrupt the life cycle before they have
[SPEAKER_05]: any opportunity to start laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other approach would be to kill
the larvae while they're feeding on the
[SPEAKER_05]: root systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interestingly, for strawberries,
the strategy for several decades has been
[SPEAKER_05]: to kill the adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas when you look at other crop
systems such as nursery crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's pretty well recognized that targeting
the larvae has been much more successful
[SPEAKER_05]: in managing root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons why this might be the
case is when you think about black fly
[SPEAKER_05]: weevil, the plants, the other plants on
which they feed are some notoriously
[SPEAKER_05]: poisonous plants, such as taxis on the
left or rhododendron on the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so black fly weevil are adapted to
feed on many toxic plants and this
[SPEAKER_05]: suggests that they have a really
well-developed suite of detoxification
[SPEAKER_05]: enzymes that may predispose them to be
able to detoxify various insecticides that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're using to try to kill them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried an approach of targeting the
larvae this past year in a field trial and
[SPEAKER_05]: I compared it with the standard approach
of applying brigade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for those growers in Canada,
the equivalent would be to target the
[SPEAKER_05]: adults with matador, which is
lambda-cyhalothrin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brigade is bifenthrin and bifenthrin and
lambda-cyhalothrin, which is the active
[SPEAKER_05]: ingredient of matador, are very similar in
their properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're broad-spectrum pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a comparison of
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments that are targeting the larvae,
actually adults or larvae, that's with a
[SPEAKER_03]: new insecticide called coragen,
targeting the larvae only with platinum or
[SPEAKER_05]: targeting just the adults with brigade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's intriguing to me is that the
numbers of larvae for those treatments
[SPEAKER_05]: that were targeting the larvae were
reduced by about half compared to the
[SPEAKER_05]: untreated check, whereas for the treatment
with brigade, which was targeting the
[SPEAKER_05]: adults, the number of larvae were no
different than the untreated checks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was reflected in the appearance
of the strawberry plants in the field,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'd like to point out to you is
this patch of red foliage.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the bifenthrin treated plot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, when I look at red foliage at
the end of the season, that's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: indication of damage to the root system
and severe plant stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it really suggests to me that the
approach that we've been taking for many
[SPEAKER_05]: years in trying to target the adult
weevils for control in strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_05]: is really rather misguided.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons why we might see an
extreme amount of damage where we've
[SPEAKER_05]: applied bifenthrin or even matador
targeting the adults is that that would
[SPEAKER_05]: have tremendous consequences also in
killing predators of various sorts,
[SPEAKER_05]: of which the most important would be
predatory ground beetles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have the adult and the larva,
both of which are really ferocious
[SPEAKER_05]: predators of black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an idea of the kind of dynamics that
might be taking place are shown with some
[SPEAKER_05]: work that I did with field-grown nurseries
in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'd like to do is compare the
intensively managed field.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a column on the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ratio of the predators,
which are the caravids, to the black vine
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that nursery situation, that was
sprayed intensively with pyrethroid
[SPEAKER_05]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had a rather unfortunate effect of
killing off the good guys and allowing the
[SPEAKER_05]: bad guys, the black vine weevils,
to persist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas a field where the grower didn't
even know that they had black vine
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils, they didn't spray at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the poor black vine weevils in this
field are subjected to about a 300 to 1
[SPEAKER_05]: ratio of predators to themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it suggests to me that targeting the
adults of black vine weevils might be
[SPEAKER_05]: really misplaced.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are cultural practices that could
also be useful, one of which has been
[SPEAKER_05]: tested in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture,
Food, and, well, I can't remember the
[SPEAKER_05]: entire acronym.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was published in 2006 by Tolman
et al.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they're using is a plastic sheet with
a few little supports.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's placed so that the body bottom
edge is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have an old strawberry field
that's heavily infested with weevils on
[SPEAKER_05]: one side and a young planting on the other
side, you'd be able to stop the weevils
[SPEAKER_05]: from wandering straight from one field to
the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this barrier has
[SPEAKER_05]: right at the edge a pitfall trap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So weevils that are crawling along the
edge of the barrier will simply walk along
[SPEAKER_05]: the edge of the barrier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they come to the end,
they fall into the pitfall trap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when different types of barriers were
compared, the sheet barrier was found to
[SPEAKER_05]: catch a lot of the weevils, whereas a
different type of barrier was not.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a practical point of view,
one of the things that we see commonly,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially with pick your own type
operations, is that there's really limited
[SPEAKER_05]: space for planting strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And growers are putting in fields of
strawberries right next to old plantings
[SPEAKER_05]: that are heavily infested with weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the growers plow under those old
plants, the weevils will simply go to
[SPEAKER_05]: where there's good vegetation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that means that they immediately
invade the new planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't realize this until next year
when you have a severe infestation in the
[SPEAKER_05]: new planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea is to put in a barrier.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the plastic sheet that
separates the two fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you plow under new plants,
the old plants have that barrier in place
[SPEAKER_05]: already and have a collection pail right
at the end of the barrier to pick up those
[SPEAKER_05]: adult weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: In summary, some of the things that you
can do for root weevil management is to
[SPEAKER_05]: monitor your planting to determine whether
you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The easiest thing is to check to see
whether you have stressed plants that have
[SPEAKER_05]: the red leaves turning in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for patches in your fields where the
leaves turn red ahead of the plants in the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that could be caused by any
number of things, root weevils,
[SPEAKER_05]: white grubs, root diseases, nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you have to dig up some plants and
take a look to see whether the roots are
[SPEAKER_05]: diseased or whether you have larvae
associated with those damaged plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other tool that's very useful
for monitoring is to look for leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: notching.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that you would do right at the end of
harvest before you renovate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And take 100 leaf sample and count the
number of leaves that have notches in
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have more than 50% of the leaves
notched by weevils, that signifies that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a high population that needs to
be managed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would suggest only considering insect
pathogenic nematodes where conditions
[SPEAKER_05]: permit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the sandy soil and warm soil
temperatures at the time of application of
[SPEAKER_05]: the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Consider planting tolerant varieties of
strawberries, tolerant to both black root
[SPEAKER_05]: rot and to black fly weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And an interesting and important
consideration is to limit the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_05]: application.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excessive nitrogen conditions lead to much
greater fecundity of the adult weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're able to convert the foliage into
eggs much more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you use excessive leaf nitrogen,
that could lead to outbreaks of these
[SPEAKER_05]: weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of the insecticides that I tested in
the field, only one of which is registered
[SPEAKER_05]: at this time for control of black fly
weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's platinum.
[SPEAKER_05]: The active ingredient is thiamethoxam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel that that's based upon both my
work and work from the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_05]: that that would be a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the Corigen product also
should be considered for registration for
[SPEAKER_05]: management of black fly weevil and other
root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has extremely low mammalian toxicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it would be a really good tool for
us to consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly, use exclusion barriers to
prevent weevils from moving from currently
[SPEAKER_05]: infested fields to newly planted fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'll open it up to questions or
turn it over to Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions for Rich or Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're waiting for those,
I'm going to switch to the end screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you again for
participating in the NASGA Winter Webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: Series and encourage you to go to the
website where we have a short
[SPEAKER_01]: five-question survey to help us get a feel
for how well you enjoyed the series and
[SPEAKER_01]: what sorts of topics you would like to
have in the next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Kevin Schooley has a question for
Rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you handle or manage fields that
are being removed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich, have you lost your audio?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't hear anything because it was
echoing so badly in my ears I turned my
[SPEAKER_05]: headset off except for the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, related to managing fields that are
being removed, there are a couple problems
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of which is that you may have really
extreme number of root weevils in that
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no practical way to kill off the
adults with insecticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Growers have tried using these pyrethroids
right at the time that they finish
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that hasn't seemed to really do a
tremendous amount of good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really the exclusion barrier to protect
nearby fields is one of the best ideas to
[SPEAKER_05]: come along in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question from Gary Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wondering if Corigen is more
effective than imidacloprid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corigen is a different class of
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a better question might be
comparing platinum with imidacloprid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Platinum and imidacloprid are in the same
class and I've always seen very mediocre
[SPEAKER_05]: results of imidacloprid for targeting
black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, Bayer got into quite a bit of
trouble when they were trying to market
[SPEAKER_05]: use of imidacloprid for black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to use imidacloprid for black
vine weevil control in a special
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry production system in England
where they grew strawberries in pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much like containers and they'd set them
into a cooler and then they'd bring them
[SPEAKER_05]: out into a greenhouse to force the
flowering and fruit development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And growers that tried to use imidacloprid
for black vine weevil control in that
[SPEAKER_05]: system found that it didn't work well at
all and they ended up with worse
[SPEAKER_05]: outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they switched over to using insect
pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thiamethoxam active ingredient in
platinum seems to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: effective against these root weevils and
so I think it has good promise there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Corigen, I think, is probably
equivalent to the thiamethoxam or platinum
[SPEAKER_05]: for control of root weevils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, though, it is not registered
yet for control of root weevil larvae.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather, its registration in strawberries,
that is for Corigen, is for targeting
[SPEAKER_05]: pests such as leaf rollers or other
caterpillars, which is kind of strange
[SPEAKER_05]: because I've never seen them to be
important pests in strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least having Corigen registered in any
way on strawberries means that it ought to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a small step to take to obtain a label
amendment that would allow it to be used
[SPEAKER_05]: for control of black vine weevil too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with that active ingredient,
acyloprine, for targeting white grubs and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's spectacular against white grubs and
so I think that there might be a good fit
[SPEAKER_05]: for targeting both white grubs and root
weevils in strawberries with that new
[SPEAKER_05]: insecticide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gone that far yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to call up the company and ask
if they'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other questions for either
Jim or Rich?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you everyone for participating
and again, I would ask if you would please
[SPEAKER_01]: just take five minutes, go to the exit
survey and fill it out for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be greatly appreciative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a wonderful strawberry season and we
hope you'll join us for the next webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
