[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Bill Weldon and I'm a graduate
student at Cornell University in the
[SPEAKER_01]: section of plant pathology and plant
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advisor is Dr. David Godori and our lab
largely focuses on powdery mildews right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and almost all of my graduate research
is focused on powdery mildew of hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a presentation that I gave in
December of 2017 at the Cornell hop
[SPEAKER_01]: conference hosted at SUNY Morrisville and
I wanted to record a copy of this
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation and get it posted online so
that people could access the PowerPoint
[SPEAKER_01]: and also just have some audio narration to
help hopefully explain some of the slides
[SPEAKER_01]: because there is some animations with some
of the slides just in case as anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that's considering growing hops or is
currently growing hops might find this
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the presentation title is differences
in managing the mildews and it's intended
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide some help with staying out of
trouble with powdery mildew and downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew which are both pathogens that we
have to worry about in hop production
[SPEAKER_01]: quite frequently here up in the northeast
and throughout the country actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why care about downy mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well both pathogens are ubiquitously
distributed across New York and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: eastern US states throughout the Midwest
and also on the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their destruction capability is quite
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're capable of causing pretty drastic
yield losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are major factors in what pushed the
New York hop industry of the 20th century
[SPEAKER_01]: westward and this was largely caused and
anytime it's in the yard is the losses are
[SPEAKER_01]: caused through distortion browning and
reduction or variation in alpha acid
[SPEAKER_01]: content so it could change the alpha acid
profile for that given variety which would
[SPEAKER_01]: also just make that variety not acceptable
for brewers point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of when so powdery mildew when
it first arrived in the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: it caused over 10 million dollars in
losses in Washington that first year and
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's really if it gets going in a yard
it's really quite capable of causing some
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty significant yield loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both pathogens are capable of causing
direct loss through modifying distorting
[SPEAKER_01]: browning the hop cones but downy mildew
can also have the additional impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: causing systemic infection of the hop
crown so the pathogen can get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: crown of the hop plant and it can exist
there from season to season so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic infection that persists from year
to year and this causes indirect losses
[SPEAKER_01]: through the reduction in the vigor of the
hop plant so each season the hop plant
[SPEAKER_01]: just gets less and less vigorous until it
gets to the ultimate point where one
[SPEAKER_01]: spring it just won't push new shoots that
following season and so it can kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: hop plant that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the importance of properly
distinguishing between the two diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might ask won't the management
approach be the same regardless of which
[SPEAKER_01]: disease is present they're both pathogens
and I'm just gonna spray fungicides in my
[SPEAKER_01]: yard if I see either and it doesn't really
matter whether I know which one is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually there because I'm just gonna be
spraying anyways so what difference does
[SPEAKER_01]: it make and that's not necessarily the
right approach and the way I think of this
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's similar to being able to properly
respond to a fire versus a tornado and so
[SPEAKER_01]: both are very destructive natural
disasters so fire and a tornado but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sitting in your house and you look
out the window and you see a tornado your
[SPEAKER_01]: response when you see a tornado is to
hightail it down into the basement and
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be the right move to make if
there was in fact a tornado outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: your house however if you think you see a
tornado you go to the basement but in
[SPEAKER_01]: reality there's actually a forest fire
outside of your house then by going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: basement you've pretty much done the worst
thing that you could do in response to a
[SPEAKER_01]: forest fire you've you've trapped yourself
out in the basement and you're gonna end
[SPEAKER_01]: up running around with your pants on fire
and it's not gonna be a great situation
[SPEAKER_01]: and I liken that to kind of
differentiating properly differentiating
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery and downy mildew between one
another so why care about the differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between downy and powdery mildew well the
two organisms responsible for downy and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery belong to completely different
kingdoms so if if you look at this figure
[SPEAKER_01]: on the right here this is just a very
simple tree of life so you have like your
[SPEAKER_01]: animals on one branch your plants on
another branch bacteria down here but the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches that I want to point your
attention to are fungi and oh my seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason for that is that in fungi so in
the branch of fungi the organism
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for causing hot powdery mildew
is a fungus so it belongs here and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus let's say is your fire however the
organism that causes hot downy mildew is
[SPEAKER_01]: not a fungus it's an oh my seed and so
this is your tornado all right so these
[SPEAKER_01]: are two completely different branches on
the tree of life these organisms are very
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of causing destruction but the
reason this impacts you is that downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and powdery mildew generally
require different fungicides for good
[SPEAKER_01]: specific control they're on different
branches and so the fungicides target that
[SPEAKER_01]: target fungi those cellular processes
often aren't present in oh my seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're on a completely different
branch and so most modern fungicides
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to control powdery mildew do
little to nothing to manage downy mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: and vice versa so it's critically
important that you're properly identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: what pathogen what disease is present in
your yard because it really impacts how
[SPEAKER_01]: effective your response is going to be so
some fungicides generally specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: downy mildew are listed here on the left
fungicides generally specific to powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew are on the right and so if you were
to think that you had powdery mildew in
[SPEAKER_01]: your yard but you actually had downy and
you decided to apply any of these products
[SPEAKER_01]: on the right there really would be very
little efficacy and kind of controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: the disease because you actually have
downy mildew in your yard and these these
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides aren't designed to target oh my
seed organisms there are some cases of
[SPEAKER_01]: overlapping efficacy on both powdery and
downy mildew so one example is pristine or
[SPEAKER_01]: flint and these products will provide
downy mildew suppression when used
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily for powdery mildew control so
there is there are a few cases where you
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit of overlapping control
and maybe you're primarily spraying for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew but you get some of this
back backhanded control on downy mildew i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to emphasize that these are examples
these products should always be used
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the label in a given state
and it's important to check that any
[SPEAKER_01]: products that you're using are actually
labeled for hops so some of these with
[SPEAKER_01]: asterisks on these slides i looked up as
of at least december of 2017 in the 2017
[SPEAKER_01]: cornell ipm hop production guide that they
are not labeled for use in new york but
[SPEAKER_01]: they are put here as examples for people
that may be in different states
[SPEAKER_01]: so now the kind of the crux how to
properly differentiate between downy and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew hopefully at this point we
have a little bit of an appreciation that
[SPEAKER_01]: these diseases are capable of causing some
pretty drastic yield losses in your yard
[SPEAKER_01]: and that it's important to be able to
properly properly differentiate the two
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases between one another so now how
how to differentiate between downy and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew so what to physically look
for in the yard in the case of downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew early in the season the first
infected shoots coming out of the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: are called basal spikes when they are
infected with downy mildew in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew these first first shoots
are called flag shoots but the basal
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes of downy mildew the very
characteristic kind of appearance of a
[SPEAKER_01]: basal spike is a very chlorotic color so
slight yellowing in comparison to the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of the more kind of more vibrant green of
the healthy hot shoots there's a general
[SPEAKER_01]: downward curling of the leaves and the
shoot appears very stunted and so the
[SPEAKER_01]: distances between the points where these
two leaves are being produced and this
[SPEAKER_01]: next set of leaves is very very short and
so the the shoot appears very stunted if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look on the underside of these leaves
you're very likely to see black to purple
[SPEAKER_01]: purplish masses of spores that are
produced exclusively on the underside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves and those are your downy mildew
spores but this is your very
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic basal spike which you will
see among the early shoots emerging in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring if downy mildew has successfully
overwintered in your yard and is emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: on some of these new new shoots in the
case of powdery mildew so here here are a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple more examples of basal spikes in
your yard or in a yard so this is a basal
[SPEAKER_01]: spike this is a basal spike here but then
there are other instances of some taller
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots maybe in the background here where
they're not quite as stunted and they the
[SPEAKER_01]: basal spikes are just very chlorotic
they're very yellow and they once you once
[SPEAKER_01]: you've seen one out in the yard they tend
to be quite noticeable you just have to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of be aware and cognizant of what
you're looking for these basal spikes can
[SPEAKER_01]: also form on your lateral branches of hops
should downy mildew be present in your
[SPEAKER_01]: yard at the time when lateral branches are
being produced and those are called aerial
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes and they have very similar
characteristics as your basal spikes
[SPEAKER_01]: except they're forming on your lateral
branches and so they're they could be
[SPEAKER_01]: higher up in the canopy but they're again
those new buds that are pretty are pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get these very chlorotic leaves
with downward stunted growth they curl
[SPEAKER_01]: downwards and you'll you'll likely see
masses of downy mildew on the underside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves so in the case of powdery
mildew they're termed flag shoots and
[SPEAKER_01]: these flag shoots again emerge early
spring when the hops start breaking ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and the buds that emerge infected with
powdery mildew appear as this picture to
[SPEAKER_01]: the right where the shoot is very
strikingly white the leaves are also
[SPEAKER_01]: typically stunted but the major kind of
defining characteristic of a flag shoot is
[SPEAKER_01]: just the striking white appearance in
comparison to all of the green healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue that doesn't have powdery mildew
surrounding it and that's that's where the
[SPEAKER_01]: term flag shoot comes from it sticks out
like a flag one other difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: downy and powdery mildew is the coloration
of the spores so downy mildew has very
[SPEAKER_01]: darkly pigmented spores and this results
in clusters of purple to black colonies on
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf these colonies exist exclusively
on on the underside of the leaves which is
[SPEAKER_01]: very it's a very defining characteristic
of downy mildew so if you're questioning
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you have downy mildew in your yard
or not and you see spores being produced
[SPEAKER_01]: on the upper side of the leaf that's kind
of a deterrent and maybe makes you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe it's not downy mildew you
should be only seeing spores on the
[SPEAKER_01]: underside of the leaves in the case of
downy alternatively for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: they produce transparent non-pigmented
spores and this results in masses of clear
[SPEAKER_01]: spores that when you're looking at it
macroscopically appear as white fluffy
[SPEAKER_01]: colonies on the leaf and these colonies
can be produced both on the upper surface
[SPEAKER_01]: and the lower surface of your leaves the
hop cones also the case for downy mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: on your stems pretty much any green above
ground tissue can can harbor these these
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms so these are some of your downy
mildew spores you can see that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: darkly pigmented and when you start
looking at these with the other naked eye
[SPEAKER_01]: so okay in comparison this is these are
your spores produced by powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: they are not pigmented they kind of appear
in these little stacks of bead like spores
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you look at that macroscopically
with with your eye on what you see is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a white fluffy colony and so here are
the examples of what you might see when
[SPEAKER_01]: you just look at it visually again notice
how downy mildew is these all these spores
[SPEAKER_01]: are on the underside of the leaf they are
black to purple and so they're much darker
[SPEAKER_01]: typically than your powdery mildew
colonies and when you look at the powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew leaf it's very strikingly white
it's a little bit fluffier it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like snow if if it's on the surface
of the leaf some of the older colonies can
[SPEAKER_01]: look a little bit matte gray if they're if
they're old and not producing any new
[SPEAKER_01]: spores but typically the thing that gives
away powdery mildew is the white fluffy
[SPEAKER_01]: colonies on your green tissue so where on
the plant is the disease found for downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and I said this before the spores
are produced exclusively on the underside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaves and that is a big big
differentiation between downy and powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew the lesions will be angular which
means that if you look at a leaf and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see the leaf veins kind of extending
out across the leaf the lesions will be
[SPEAKER_01]: trapped in between those veins they can't
extend past those veins and so those veins
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of trap the little lesions into
angular kind of shapes and for downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew the growth can spread into the hop
crown and cause that systemic infection
[SPEAKER_01]: for powdery mildew the spores can be found
on all green plant tissue and this
[SPEAKER_01]: includes both sides of the leaves and so
if you're seeing something that's forming
[SPEAKER_01]: on the top side of the leaf and you're
trying to differentiate between downy and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery that's a good indication that you
might be dealing with powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: again it cannot cause systemic infection
of the crown that is only only something
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about with downy mildew however
in both cases the the dormant buds that
[SPEAKER_01]: exist sort of just beneath the soil line
during the winter can be colonized by both
[SPEAKER_01]: downy and powdery mildew and that's how
your basal spikes in the case of downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and your flag shoots in the case of
powdery mildew emerge in the spring so
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a picture example of the angular
lesions that I was talking about for downy
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and so you see your leaf veins and
then there's even smaller leaf veins that
[SPEAKER_01]: are progressing through the spaces between
the larger ones and those are trapping
[SPEAKER_01]: your downy mildew colonies into very
angular shapes here's what it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: from the top and again so the spores are
only on the underside the leaf on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: will start to show slight discoloration
that might turn necrotic brown color as
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf gets older but they are in in
line with where the colonies are forming
[SPEAKER_01]: on the underside of the leaf and so that's
that's a response to the colonies forming
[SPEAKER_01]: on the underside of the leaf here's
another case this is a slightly older
[SPEAKER_01]: downy mildew colony again you can see
those angular lesions but they are turning
[SPEAKER_01]: more more of a brown color because the
colonies are much older and they've caused
[SPEAKER_01]: more damage to the leaf as time has passed
in the case of powdery mildew this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: an example of the very white fluffy spores
that you might in the colonies that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might see if you're coming across powdery
mildew in your yard and they are caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: the clear spores that build up in the
amounts of hundreds of thousands and
[SPEAKER_01]: appear white when you're just looking at
it with your eye they are capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading to any green above ground plant
tissue so here it is on a hot cone and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the case of downy mildew it can also cause
the brown discoloration it's it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a darker kind of reddish brown in
the case of downy mildew in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew it's more of your
traditional kind of just necrosis and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll probably be able to see some of the
white powdery growth on the cone but the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest way to identify these pathogens is
not by differentiating how your cone looks
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have leaf kind of damage
harboring either downy mildew or powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew around and that's that's much
easier to differentiate than trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide which pathogen is causing a problem
based on how the cones are looking so one
[SPEAKER_01]: note about varietal resistance for hot
downy mildew is that there are two ways as
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that hot downy mildew can cause
damage to a hot plant it can affect your
[SPEAKER_01]: hot cones and cause a direct yield loss
through damage of the hot cone and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: can cause the systemic infection that
causes a year-to-year reduction in the
[SPEAKER_01]: yield potential of that plant as it gets
weaker from year-to-year from having been
[SPEAKER_01]: systemically infected and that creates
kind of this spectrum of resistance across
[SPEAKER_01]: plants where some plants may be resistant
to the foliar aspect of downy mildew but
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to the systemic infection or
susceptible to both foliar and systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to both or whichever the last
one the resistant to the foliar are
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to foliar resistant to a
systemic infection and so it breaks out of
[SPEAKER_01]: these four quadrants and really kind of
results in more of a spectrum than a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear-cut definition of this variety for
downy mildew is resistant because there is
[SPEAKER_01]: there are so many factors at play that it
unless it's completely resistant to both
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar infection and your crown systemic
infection then there's going to be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum of the resistance associated with
that variety when considering the varietal
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to powdery mildew again there
are some varieties that are published as
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to powdery mildew in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there are some that have recently
lost resistance in Pacific Northwest and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the varieties nugget and cascade have
strains of powdery mildew that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: found out there where the strains are kind
of adapted to grow better than they
[SPEAKER_01]: normally would be able to and so that
resistance is recently lost in Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest and these are varieties that are
worth paying attention to on the East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast because it's worth knowing and
tracking whether these strains present in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pacific Northwest have made their way
eastward so another way to properly
[SPEAKER_01]: identify the disease is to know the
optimal conditions for downy and powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew there are basically kinds of
weather that favor one disease over the
[SPEAKER_01]: other and so typically you get general
seasons that favor high prevalence of
[SPEAKER_01]: either downy mildew or powdery mildew for
downy mildew these are your rainy seasons
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's strongly favored by wet rainy
conditions seasons of high humidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: long dew periods are also conducive for
downy mildew and spores are pigmented
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on the underside of the leaf which
these are conditions conducive for high
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity if this is relevant to you this
would the 2017 growing season was a very
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive season where we got a lot of
rain there were long periods of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: wetness and the downy mildew spore
actually requires wet leaf wetness it
[SPEAKER_01]: requires moisture on the surface of the
leaf in order to be able to infect the
[SPEAKER_01]: host and so that was a very very favorable
growing season for downy mildew in the
[SPEAKER_01]: case of powdery mildew it's favored during
seasons of temperate more more dry
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions it doesn't require water to
infect the plant so theoretically every
[SPEAKER_01]: day is a potential infection period but
the conditions that are most favorable for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew are kind of your temperate
overcast days where there's not direct
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight because those spores are not
pigmented the Sun can damage the spores
[SPEAKER_01]: and and kill them off the 2016 growing
season in New York was or was an example
[SPEAKER_01]: of a season that was favor favorable for
powdery mildew it was much drier than 2017
[SPEAKER_01]: and we saw many more cases of powdery
mildew that year so now now that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: properly identified what disease is in
your yard it's important to know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: properly manage both downy and powdery
mildew so kind of the first and foremost
[SPEAKER_01]: way to make your life easier is to choose
resistant varieties when possible this has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be taken into consideration with
varieties that are in demand in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing industry obviously but when
possible at least always give
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration to the resistance or the
susceptibility of the varieties that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're planting in your yards that you go
in with realistic expectations of how
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive your disease management program
is going to be this is especially
[SPEAKER_01]: important for organic production and it
will also guide your scouting intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of whether you're growing
organically or conventionally as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: your spray program intensity because it
will inform you kind of how how at risk
[SPEAKER_01]: are you for for infection of both downy or
powdery mildew so you should you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting as soon as shoots emerge and
scout as often as feasible as feasible for
[SPEAKER_01]: your operation I know this can be tough
and some critical scouting periods for
[SPEAKER_01]: downy mildew are at shoot emergence at the
start of the season because those are when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to identify your basal spikes
and you would want to rogue those out at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time of shoot training this is another
time that's very important because if your
[SPEAKER_01]: growing tips of your shoots are infected
with downy mildew they will become stunted
[SPEAKER_01]: they will stop growing upwards and they
will likely fall from the trellis which
[SPEAKER_01]: will require you to have to retrain shoots
which could result in a yield loss just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically by improper or it messes with
your training time at the time of
[SPEAKER_01]: production of lateral branches so those
aerial spikes that we mentioned those can
[SPEAKER_01]: become a problem during the time of
production of lateral branches and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to scout well during this time
because this can basically cause your
[SPEAKER_01]: lateral branches to be killed off which
would result in a yield loss because those
[SPEAKER_01]: would be branches that would not result in
forming proper hop cones and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: should also be scouting one week prior to
bloom through four weeks post bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is the period when the hop
cones are at most at risk for becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: infected with downy mildew so the cones
are most susceptible during this time and
[SPEAKER_01]: if they become infected during this time
they're going to result in the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of distortion the greatest
fluctuation away from the norm of the
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha acid level your betas away from
whatever that variety should be behaving
[SPEAKER_01]: as will be most affected if they get
infected during this time for powdery I
[SPEAKER_01]: again scout as soon as shoots emerge and
scout as often as possible the two major
[SPEAKER_01]: critical scouting periods for powdery
mildew are at shoot emergence at the start
[SPEAKER_01]: of the season so you should be scouting
for the flag shoots and be rowing those
[SPEAKER_01]: out should you find any and then one week
prior to bloom through three weeks post
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom because this is the period when the
hop cones are most susceptible to powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew infection and the cones are most
affected and most result in kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest amount of distortion and improper
alpha and beta acid levels and cones so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to tell you just to scout and
that's a very vague thing to say so
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully those times are helpful and then
also here's a general scouting approach so
[SPEAKER_01]: when disease pressure is low you should be
scouting one to two hundred plants every
[SPEAKER_01]: time you scout and these should be evenly
dispersed among varieties and throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: your yard should pay special attention to
the basal foliage as well as any young
[SPEAKER_01]: still developing hop cones and leaves your
basal foliage that's a very conducive
[SPEAKER_01]: micro climate for the development of downy
and powdery mildew so it's protected from
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight often the humidity level is a
little bit higher so that would favor your
[SPEAKER_01]: downy mildew and this is also just a part
of the yard a level of the yard where very
[SPEAKER_01]: young kind of actively growing hop tissue
is being produced and the youngest hop
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue is typically the most susceptible
part of the hop plant for downy and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew infection for downy look
for the basal spikes and dark spores on
[SPEAKER_01]: the underside of the leaves for powdery
look for your white powdery colonies and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on your young leaves any kind
of suspect shoots or leaves that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: see in your yard you can kind of do an
at-home humid chamber to try and cause
[SPEAKER_01]: these organisms to produce spores which
are very characteristic giveaways for what
[SPEAKER_01]: disease you might be dealing with so
remove a questionable shoot and place it
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of a ziplock bag with a damp paper
towel for downy you want to store this bag
[SPEAKER_01]: at room temperature in the dark because
they sporulate in the dark and that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be the easiest way to confirm whether or
not it's downy mildew for powdery stored
[SPEAKER_01]: at room temperature in a spot that gets
daily light dark cycles because that is
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with how powdery mildew
produces its spores and the end goal is
[SPEAKER_01]: just to try and get this shoot in question
to produce spores because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest way to figure out what what
organism what disease you may be dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with so check for production of spores
after one or two days obviously fungicides
[SPEAKER_01]: are very crucial in control of both of
these diseases and it's important to know
[SPEAKER_01]: your fungicides so it's crucial to know
which fungicides apply to downy mildew or
[SPEAKER_01]: to powdery mildew you can check the label
if you're unsure sometimes it won't
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically say downy mildew or or
specifically powdery mildew but in those
[SPEAKER_01]: cases it often will say other organisms
that if you do a quick google search you
[SPEAKER_01]: could figure out whether that's a fungus
or an oomycete if we think back to that
[SPEAKER_01]: tree of life the fire versus the tornado
and if there's a bunch of oomycetes listed
[SPEAKER_01]: on that label it's likely applying to
oomycetes which is a downy mildew organism
[SPEAKER_01]: but just check the label if you're unsure
and be sure that you're using the right
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicide to target the organism that you
think is in your yard there are many
[SPEAKER_01]: applications decisions to make beyond the
label so you need to think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy of the fungicide the potential
for resistance so maybe saving your big
[SPEAKER_01]: guns for just the most crucial times
during the growing season the longevity
[SPEAKER_01]: retention redistribution of these so
there's decisions just beyond deciding
[SPEAKER_01]: what fungicide product you want to use
like i just said save the big guns for
[SPEAKER_01]: your most critical management periods in
the case of powdery mildew this would be
[SPEAKER_01]: around bloom those one to three week
period that we were talking about so your
[SPEAKER_01]: quintech your pristine again make sure
that these are products that are labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: for use in your state downy mildew this
could be rivus plus phosphorus acids ampro
[SPEAKER_01]: these are typically kind of big guns for
control of these pathogens so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: save them for your most critical critical
times where you need great control there
[SPEAKER_01]: are some shared cultural practices for
both downy and mildew downy mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew that are kind of the
legwork quote-unquote to make your
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides work better so if you do this
stuff it's easier to keep these diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: under control and your fungicides or have
greater efficacy if kind of these cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practices are part of your management
approach so pruning and or crowning are is
[SPEAKER_01]: a strategy that you do at the start of the
growing season to remove some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: buds that may have overwintered with
powdery or downy mildew on them and so
[SPEAKER_01]: this would cut back your first flush of
growth essentially that may have shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: that would eventually become your basil
spikes in the case of downy or flag shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: in the case of powdery and we we kill
those those off and so then hopefully that
[SPEAKER_01]: second flush of growth that comes from
deeper in the soil does not have any
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery or downy mildew on it and you're
left with only healthy hop tissue the
[SPEAKER_01]: training time is important because it gets
the shoots that you want up off the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and away from all the basil foliage and
then this allows you to focus on cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: up that basil foliage which can harbor and
be a kind of a micro climate ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: development of both of these diseases
stripping the lower leaves is an option
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I have some photos associated with
this and so pruning these might be your
[SPEAKER_01]: first flush of growth cut these back you
might be able to remove either the basil
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes or the five shoots that emerge in
this flush of growth training times
[SPEAKER_01]: picture associated with that and then
here's a picture to help describe what we
[SPEAKER_01]: mean by stripping the lower leaves you're
breaking the green bridge so all that
[SPEAKER_01]: basil foliage the hop tissue growing along
the soil line that might connect each
[SPEAKER_01]: plant kind of bridge that that distance
between the the plants so this distance
[SPEAKER_01]: right here we're splitting that up and
we're also increasing airflow through the
[SPEAKER_01]: yard stripping the lower leaves is not
recommended for young yards so your first
[SPEAKER_01]: your second year yards and also some
varieties don't respond well to losing
[SPEAKER_01]: their first three feet of leaf foliage so
your left less vigorous varieties might
[SPEAKER_01]: might this might not be something that
you'd want to do for them and here here's
[SPEAKER_01]: an instance of what I mean by the green
bridge and so you can see this hop tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: going along the soil line and effectively
connecting these two plants to one another
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it could feasibly happen where
powdery mildew just kind of crawls along
[SPEAKER_01]: spreads from leaf to leaf and all of a
sudden you have it in this plant and so
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you can do to break that green
bridge is good so I'm good sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: information to reference the Cornell
integrated hops production guide is put
[SPEAKER_01]: out each year and this is New York
specific information regarding labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries so each year that list gets
updated and changes slightly it's
[SPEAKER_01]: available through the Cornell bookstore
and this is not relevant I guess the
[SPEAKER_01]: relevance now as this is posted is that
the 2018 edition is available there's also
[SPEAKER_01]: the field guide for integrated pest
management hops the link can be found on
[SPEAKER_01]: the USA hops website with the research and
technical tab I think if you do a Google
[SPEAKER_01]: search of this title you can find it on a
handful of different websites a link to it
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's one that has worked for me in
the past the 2017 Michigan hot management
[SPEAKER_01]: guide they did a very very nice job there
at Michigan State University extension and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a very good management guide
another one for the East Coast and then
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my projects that I've been working
on is to put together a hops web page for
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell and so we have that here so if you
Google search Cornell sips hops or follow
[SPEAKER_01]: this URL here you'll be taken to the hops
page for Cornell and here we've uploaded
[SPEAKER_01]: some outreach content some disease
management stuff so management of hop down
[SPEAKER_01]: and mildew managing the mildew so kind of
a pared down version of this talk five
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations forever planning your first
hop management of powdery mildew and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is something that we hope to continually
update as more articles are put together
[SPEAKER_01]: that is where this talk will be uploaded
to and is hopefully just going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a reliable source of hop related
content so with that thank you for your
[SPEAKER_01]: time feel free to email me if you have any
questions my email is on the first slide
[SPEAKER_01]: it's www.395.cornell.edu and with that
yeah thank you here here's my email again
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hope you have a good day thank you
this has been a production of Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University on the web at cornell.edu you
you you you
