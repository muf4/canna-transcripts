[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you came to the wrong room,
I'm David Wickle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my exit seminar and today I'm
going to talk to you about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: comparative genomics that I've done in
seed-free plants over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, why study seed-free plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the fact that they're sometimes
easily overlooked in the shadow of
[SPEAKER_01]: angiosperm-dominated flora, seed-free
plants, especially ferns and lycophytes,
[SPEAKER_01]: are really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're incredibly diverse in form.
[SPEAKER_01]: They inhabit a diverse array of habitats
and serve as important members of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems where they're found.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their name implies, they don't use
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, they reproduce via spores,
which can create these independent haploid
[SPEAKER_01]: gametophytes that then go on to release
sperm that fertilizes them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These eggs producing sporophytes starting
the whole cycle over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also evolutionarily important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ferns are the sister lineage to all
seed plants and lycophytes are sister to
[SPEAKER_01]: all other vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've retained lots of important
ancestral traits, things like vasculature
[SPEAKER_01]: and sporophyte branching, and have also
independently evolved key features like
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making comparisons that can help
give us an idea about the hidden processes
[SPEAKER_01]: that guide evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've talked about why seed-free plants,
but why genomics?
[SPEAKER_01]: The last 10 years have been a real
renaissance for genomic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a surge in the number of
assemblies published, as you can see over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years on this y-axis, and also in the
quality of those assemblies, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: x-axis, as shown on the y-axis here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite this surge in genome assemblies,
there are a lot of orders that are still
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly represented, and that's because
genomics tends to focus on species that
[SPEAKER_01]: are economically important or that have
small genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, those kinds of plants
are in the minority among ferns and
[SPEAKER_01]: lycophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lots of orders of ferns for
which there are no genome assemblies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of when I started this PhD,
a couple of orders of lycophytes that also
[SPEAKER_01]: did not have any genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm going to talk to you about my
research in comparative genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start off by talking a little
bit about whole-genome duplication using a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of our genome assemblies as case
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to talk to you about
Isoides tywinensis and change gears a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit to talk about CAM
photosynthesis and the convergent
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of CAM in this aquatic lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to finish up talking
about my latest research looking into the
[SPEAKER_01]: recurrent formation of allopolyploids in
the Isoides apalachiana complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started with whole-genome
duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk just a little bit more
about genomics of seed-free plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, I want to talk about the
difference between heterosperous lineages
[SPEAKER_01]: versus homosperous lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So briefly, heterosperous lineages,
which include all seed plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: all flowering plants, produce two
different types of spores that then go on
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce two different types of
gametophytes, one of which produces sperm
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of which produces an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homosperous lineages, on the other hand,
produce a single hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_01]: gametophyte capable of producing both
sperm and egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this distinction is important for
genomics primarily because homosperous
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages tend to have much larger genomes
characterized by much more numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the ferns, the vast majority of
lineages are homosperous, the one
[SPEAKER_01]: exception being the order salviniales,
the water ferns, which are heterosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within lycophytes, the majority of species
are heterosperous, but the earliest
[SPEAKER_01]: diverging lineage, lycopodiales,
is entirely homosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I was talking about earlier,
homosperous plants tend to have much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger genomes, much more chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: An extreme example is shown over here in
Ophioglossum reticulatum, which has a
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome count of over 1,200
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we compare this to a heterosperous
angiosperm, the grass Panicum virginiatum,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I believe is actually a tetraploid,
it only has 36 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an extreme example, but it's a
pattern that's borne out across all
[SPEAKER_01]: vasculotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that homosperous lineages,
on average, have three to four times the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of chromosomes as their related
heterosperous lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to explain whole genome
duplication briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this section is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole genome duplication is very common
among all vascular plants, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: ferns and lycophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it consists of just the
duplication of all the chromosomes inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fascinating to me because I feel
like I was taught that evolution was a
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of gradual process where one mutation
builds on another over enormous periods of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whole genome duplication suddenly and
rapidly changes the entire genome of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, resulting in usually immediate
genetic isolation from its parental
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages and also in drastic changes to
its phenotype while providing the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: material for evolution in the form of more
genes, more chromosomal material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if this were the end of the story,
we would expect to see plant lineages,
[SPEAKER_01]: heterosperous and homosperous,
characterized by large numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes, by multisomic inheritance,
by polyploid expression of genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we don't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, even in lineages like,
say, Arabidopsis, with a known history of
[SPEAKER_01]: whole genome duplication, we see
relatively small genomes with diploid
[SPEAKER_01]: expression and disomic inheritance,
and that's because of this process of
[SPEAKER_01]: diploidization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diploidization is the process by which
we go from this state, right, through the
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploid state and back to something
resembling a diploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this happens through chromosomal
rearrangements that restore pairing of
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes at meiosis, and also through
large-scale loss of genes and chromosomal
[SPEAKER_01]: material, typically through illegitimate
recombination that can lead to a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of outcomes, right, that further serves to
isolate these lineages from one another,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the ones that gave rise to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of this process of
diploidization, it can be difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: detect whole genome duplications that
happened far back in time, in evolutionary
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do that by a few different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is KS, and KS functions on
the principle that when a gene is
[SPEAKER_01]: duplicated, the two duplicates are
identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they diverge, we can plot that
divergence along the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we compare many genes, right,
within a gene, a whole genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we expect to see, if there's no
history of whole genome duplication,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we see down here in the bottom
corner in Selaginella, a sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: exponential decrease in the number of
genes that have higher KS values,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a result of fractionation,
genes being lost over time as they diverge
[SPEAKER_01]: in sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the case of a whole genome
duplication, we expect to see these peaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those peaks represent a cohort of
genes that were all duplicated at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, and then are diverging at relatively
the same rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first evidence that we can
use to identify whole genome duplications.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is phylogenetic reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In phylogenetic reconciliation,
we take many gene trees from many species,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we compare them to a known
species tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we look for in those gene trees
are branches or clades that are duplicated
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over and over again in multiple
gene trees, represented by this line here,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The percentage of times we see these nodes
duplicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we see nodes that are duplicated
far more than others, we can infer that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a duplication happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing about phylogenetic
reconciliation is it doesn't simply tell
[SPEAKER_01]: us if duplications occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can tell us when they occurred and
place them into this evolutionary context.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final way that we identify ancient
whole genome duplications, and arguably
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the gold standard, is Syntony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Syntony, this operates on the
concept that when a chromosome is
[SPEAKER_01]: duplicated, an entire chromosome,
all the genes along that chromosome start
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the same order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, through diploidization,
those genes can be shuffled around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those genes can be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, for millions or tens of
millions of years, blocks of genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are collinear or Syntonic exist,
and we can detect those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are evidence that at some point
in the past, there was a large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: duplication, right, of entire chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plots here actually show Syntony
between two different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do Syntony either within a
species, right, and if you see Syntonic
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks, you expect that there was a
duplication, or you can compare them
[SPEAKER_01]: between species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for instance, if you see a duplication
in species A, but not in species B,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would expect each block in species B,
here represented by dots, or here
[SPEAKER_01]: represented by lines, to be represented
twice in species A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Syntony, similar to phylogenetic
reconciliation, can give us an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: which duplications are shared between
different lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now that we're all experts in
detecting whole genome duplication,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna talk about the first genome
today, and that's that of Alsopolis
[SPEAKER_01]: spinulosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This assembly was produced in
collaboration with researchers at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese Academy of Forestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some assembly stats up there,
but that's not what I'm gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, we're gonna stick to WGD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the best of scenarios,
when you have all of the possible evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: available to you, detecting whole genome
duplications can be relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But figuring out how many happened and
when they occurred is often not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's demonstrated by this phylogeny
here, where I've plotted the result of
[SPEAKER_01]: four different studies over the last four
years that looked at whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: duplication in the sciatica alias,
or the tree ferns, right, the group to
[SPEAKER_01]: which this fern belongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one found different
conclusions represented by these circles
[SPEAKER_01]: on the phylogenics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of these is a whole genome
duplication, right, inferred by a
[SPEAKER_01]: different study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to draw your attention briefly to
these with the asterisk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different studies use different species in
their sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these two cases, they only included
a single species from the sciatica alias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible, had they had better
sampling and included more species from
[SPEAKER_01]: that group, that they would have inferred
a duplication of the same place that we
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, ours are on here in yellow,
but you'll see them again later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the usual battery of tests,
right, that I just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phylogenetic reconciliation identified two
duplications, one before the divergence of
[SPEAKER_01]: sciatica alias, another before the
divergence of the sciatica alias.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was largely recapitulated by KS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the sciatica alias, we can see two
peaks represented here in blue and orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sciatica alias, a little harder to
see because it's a very old duplication,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we can see a single peak more diffuse
further out from the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was really exciting about this
particular analysis was the sentinel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said earlier, right, sentinel is
lost as species diploidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And becomes less and less informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally over scales of millions or
tens of millions of years, it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: harder and harder to detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our most recent whole genome duplication
that we identified in this group happened
[SPEAKER_01]: over a hundred million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, despite that, we see this
incredible amount of sentinel with each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these lines representing a sentinel
gene pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more than that, this one's not
organized particularly well to show that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we see an almost one-to-one
relationship between the various
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes here, showing that there's
been very little chromosomal rearrangement
[SPEAKER_01]: since this whole genome duplication a
hundred million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unheard of in vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some cases in mosses and also in
fish where intergenomic sentinel,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is between two genomes, has been
preserved for a hundred million years or
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 million years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only case I know of in
vascular plants and the only case I know
[SPEAKER_01]: of where this intra genomic sentinel
following a whole genome duplication is so
[SPEAKER_01]: well preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, our homosperous fern
genome assembly was not the only one that
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I would like, right,
to extrapolate my results to all
[SPEAKER_01]: homosperous plants, or at least all
homosperous ferns, there are two problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seratopterus richardii and
adiantum capillus venaris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these ferns have experienced whole
genome duplications more recently than
[SPEAKER_01]: alzophilus spinulosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, when we look at the sentinel
within their genomes, we don't see the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are relatively few gene pairs
preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ferns just came out, these
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a great explanation for
this yet, but suffice to say that the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are regulating the number of
chromosomes, right, that are driving up
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of chromosomes in these
homosperous ferns are not as simple as
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced recombination or less
rearrangement during diploidization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said earlier, there are not just
homosperous ferns, there are also
[SPEAKER_01]: homosperous lycophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the opportunity to collaborate
with researchers at JGI and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science to
do not one, but two genome assemblies in
[SPEAKER_01]: this group of lycopodiaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might notice, I said two genome
assemblies, but since we're all experts at
[SPEAKER_01]: WGED now, you recognize these asentony
plots, and I have three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because, compared to the
Asiatica is a recent allopolypoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: allotetrapoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our collaborators at the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Science were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to separate those two subgenomes so that
we could perform analyses on them
[SPEAKER_01]: separately, which was very interesting for
our whole genome duplication analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also much more computationally
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hupertsia Asiatica has over 100
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, usual battery of tests,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are our KS plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see single peaks in both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these vertical lines that weren't
in the other ones just represent the
[SPEAKER_01]: divergence either between Hupertsia
Asiatica and Diphasiastrum complinatum,
[SPEAKER_01]: our two species here, shown in green,
or each of them and their closest
[SPEAKER_01]: heterosperous relative in isoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with KS in this group is that
substitution rates are very slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, if you have multiple whole
genome duplications, these KS peaks can
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to stack up on one another,
making it very difficult to discern
[SPEAKER_01]: whether this peak represents one or
multiple duplications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get more insight, right,
we turned to our phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_01]: reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find in Diphasiastrum is,
in fact, a single duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Hupertsia Asiatica, we find two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One prior to the divergence of the two
subgenomes, and another prior to the
[SPEAKER_01]: divergence of the entire genus of
Hupertsia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, what was exciting here was not
that we identified whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: duplications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leica podiaceae is rife with whole genome
duplication, yet another thing that made
[SPEAKER_01]: placing them using KS particularly
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was exciting was the synteny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our phylogeny here,
right, with whole genome duplications
[SPEAKER_01]: marked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have intergenomic synteny
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are not within a single genome,
they're between two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one shows synteny between the
two subgenomes of Hupertsia Asiatica.
[SPEAKER_01]: These species emerged 33 million years
ago, which is certainly not too long for
[SPEAKER_01]: synteny to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the representation of
synteny between these two, so each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these black dots is not just a gene pair,
that's a block of collinear genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that it's almost perfectly
preserved across both of these genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're almost identical in gene order,
which is incredible after 33 million
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really incredible is when we
compare these two species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hupertsia Asiatica and Diphasiastrum
complinatum are as divergent as two Leica
[SPEAKER_01]: podiaceae species can be, with our best
guess putting them at about 400 million
[SPEAKER_01]: years diverged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've both experienced independent whole
genome duplications in that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite that, we see large proportions
of the genome represented in our synteny
[SPEAKER_01]: plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, we can also identify a
two to four relationship between the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes that recapitulates our finding
from the phylogenetic analysis that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have one duplication in Diphasiastrum for
two in Hupertsia Asiatica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if our findings in Alsophila were
impressive, this is mind blown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, forget about moss, forget about
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no other examples of synteny
being preserved over these kind of time
[SPEAKER_01]: periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it points to this fact that at
least in some homosporous lineages,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rearrangement of chromosomes following
duplication or even following speciation
[SPEAKER_01]: is occurring at a very slow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of rates, before I move on,
I briefly want to talk about substitution
[SPEAKER_01]: rates in these two groups because it's
another thing that unites them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sciatiales have previously been shown
to have low substitution rates using
[SPEAKER_01]: chloroplast data compared to other firms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our study used nuclear data for both
of these genomic data and found that they
[SPEAKER_01]: had lower substitution rates in Leica
podiaceae relative to all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: heterosporous Leica fights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in sciatiales relative to all other
ferns, homosporous and heterosporous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, while I don't think that this is
directly linked, that is to say causative,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, with our reduced rates of
rearrangement, it's another interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation that we have between these two
groups compared to other heterosporous
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages and even other homosporous
lineages of ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On to my favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about isomedes for a
little while and we're going to shift
[SPEAKER_01]: gears, not talk about whole genome
duplication and talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: ham photosynthesis instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isomedes are just an incredible group of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very diminutive, right,
easy to overlook, but they're thought to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the closest living relatives of these
giant tree-like plants that used to
[SPEAKER_01]: dominate the carboniferous flora and,
in fact, make up the majority of the coal
[SPEAKER_01]: that we burn today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite being, again, much smaller than
their relatives, they have a worldwide
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They occupy a wide range of both aquatic
and terrestrial habitats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're part of a long unbranching
lineage, right, that diverged from all
[SPEAKER_01]: other vascular plants over 350 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sequenced the isomedes tywinensis
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually the first genomic
analysis I did when I got to Cornell,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm really not going to spend any time
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will come up again later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did do our whole genome duplication
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while symphony was not particularly
informative in this group, we did find
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence for one duplication in its
history from a combination of KS and
[SPEAKER_01]: phylogenetic reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really neat about isomedes is
that it does ham photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've heard about ham before,
it has almost certainly been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of dry adapted plants like this
cactus or this agave that do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: conserve water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, in dry adapted plants,
ham allows them to close their stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: during the hottest part of the day to
reduce transpiration of the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then open their stomata at night,
take up carbon dioxide, fix that carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide and store it as malate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's released during the day to
conduct photosynthesis while the stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: are closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isomedes does ham photosynthesis when it's
completely submerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's clearly not doing this to conserve
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it doing ham?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some interesting information on
this from my colleague, Jacob Suiza,
[SPEAKER_01]: who published a paper where they did CO2
starvation experiments that show that
[SPEAKER_01]: isomedes is doing ham most likely because
of the limited availability of CO2 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon dioxide diffuses through water very
poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the day, it's used up very
quickly by algae and other aquatic plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the water column.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an adaptation to this, isomedes
absorbs as much CO2 as it can at night
[SPEAKER_01]: through its roots, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the day, right,
it releases the main malate from the
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It liberates the CO2 and fixes that carbon
into sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things we found when
we compared gene expression in isomedes to
[SPEAKER_01]: these terrestrial plants, not these
terrestrial plants, but pineapple,
[SPEAKER_01]: kalanchoe and sedum, is that gene
expression, both the genes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: differentially expressed and the manner in
which they're expressed, is very similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost identical in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was interesting, if for no other
reason, because there's actually been some
[SPEAKER_01]: pushback in calling this CAM, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: CAM is an adaptation to dry environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really shows that at least
from a genetic perspective, there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: no difference between what these plants
are doing and what these plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some differences between
aquatic plants and terrestrial plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for the sake of time, I'm really
just going to focus on the one that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think is the coolest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is Pepsi, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Pepsi is the enzyme that carboxyl that
does the first carboxylation reaction in
[SPEAKER_01]: the CAM pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepsi is a pretty diverse gene family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be broadly divided into two groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plant-type Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the one that most people talk
about in reference to CAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that's generally been
co-opted for that first carboxylation
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's bacterial-type Pepsi,
which is a little bit more obscure,
[SPEAKER_01]: often lowly expressed, if at all,
in photosynthetic tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine my surprise when I looked at
which copy was expressed in isoletes and,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, found not one, but two
copies that were highly expressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then found that the most highly
expressed was actually this bacterial-type
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is one place where bacterial-type
Pepsi is known to be highly expressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's in the developing seeds of the
castor oil plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, it's found to form a
heterooctamer with plant-type Pepsi and is
[SPEAKER_01]: found to be much less sensitive to
inhibition by malate, which accumulates in
[SPEAKER_01]: large quantities in these castor oil seeds
as they're developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another place we know of where
malate accumulates in large quantities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's in the leaves of these CAM
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I have no evidence to support
this, I think it's a really exciting story
[SPEAKER_01]: and something that certainly merits
following up on that it's very possible
[SPEAKER_01]: that isoletes that expresses both of these
copies of Pepsi with relatively similar
[SPEAKER_01]: expression patterns in the leaves might
also do this as an additive adaptation to
[SPEAKER_01]: the increased amount of malate in the
leaves, allowing them to fix a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more CO2 at night and be inhibited a
little less.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, on to my last chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still isoletes, but we're going to talk a
little bit about the recurrent formation
[SPEAKER_01]: of allopolyploid lineages in isoletes
apalachiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while CAM is really cool, it is not
actually the first thing that attracted me
[SPEAKER_01]: to isoletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isoletes is known for its really high
propensity to form hybrids and also
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, researchers have found if you put
basically any two diploid species of
[SPEAKER_01]: isoletes together, they will form hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is those diploid hybrids are
sterile, basically across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, they can duplicate their
entire genome, right, whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: duplication, which restores fertility,
allowing them to form these really
[SPEAKER_01]: prolific populations like these two of
isoletes apalachiana polyploid that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get to know in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this depicts the reticulate
relationships between isoletes
[SPEAKER_01]: inglumaniae, there's the hybrid
relationships, one species, one North
[SPEAKER_01]: American species, and a few other species
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these species in green are various
hybrids, and the polyploid hybrids are
[SPEAKER_01]: represented by shapes with different
numbers of sides, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Six sides is hexaploid, three sides is
triploid, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this proclivity, right, for
hybridization and polyploidization makes
[SPEAKER_01]: this a great system to study the recurrent
formation of polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing before I talk about
isoletes apalachiana is throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: study of polyploids, throughout the
history of the study of polyploids,
[SPEAKER_01]: various people have referred to them as
dead ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most recently, in 2011 and 2012,
a series of papers came out that
[SPEAKER_01]: identified lower diversification rates and
higher rates of extinction in polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this also sort of makes sense based on
what we see in isoletes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that this would come back later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find evidence for one whole genome
duplication in this whole history of
[SPEAKER_01]: isoletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mind you, we could have more sampling,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had more species, we might find more
along other branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this doesn't really work, right,
with what we know about the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, more than half or around half of
the species in isoletes are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are there so many polyploids now,
but so few, relatively few in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary record?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes back to this idea that
perhaps polyploids form all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, but don't actually live that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, it has important
implications, not just for evolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also for conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many polyploids are rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a lot of them are even federally
listed species, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't live that long,
if they don't, say, you know, add mix with
[SPEAKER_01]: other populations, if they're relatively
isolated and short-lived, maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: effort would be better spent on the
diploid species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer this and some other basic
questions sort of about polyploid
[SPEAKER_01]: speciation in isoletes, I turned to this
group, isoletes apalachiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked it for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very large distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its parentage is already known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a lot of mileage out of this
poster that Peter made, like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But postdoc in our lab, Peter,
previously found that it's the product of
[SPEAKER_01]: at least two separate hybridization events
between isoletes, Engelmannii,
[SPEAKER_01]: and isoletes ballidae.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was done, though, with low-copy
nuclear genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to leverage RadSeq, next-gen
sequencing, whole-genome skimming,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a more in-depth look using more
populations at how frequently these
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages form, whether or not lineages can
form with either diploid parent as the
[SPEAKER_01]: maternal parent, and whether or not we see
any evidence of gene flow within these
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I once again got to do a lot of field
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I conduct field work all the way from
upstate New York down to northern Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this map, tetraploids I collected are
represented by green squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Engelmannii is represented by blue
circles, and isoletes ballidae is
[SPEAKER_01]: represented by yellow circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are colors I'll try to stick to for
the next few slides, though I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's at least one exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finding isoletes in the field is sort
of like playing Where's Waldo?
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sea of walders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, like, five or six different
plant species in this little clump in this
[SPEAKER_01]: lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is isoletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to tell me which one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I collected lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent them off for DD RadSeq,
which basically consisted of me just
[SPEAKER_01]: weighing plant material into a plastic
tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also did genome skimming,
for which I got a little bit of wet lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: some DNA extraction and library prep,
for which I was awarded a graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: fellowship at the Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with Liz Zimmer and did all of
this wet lab under the expert guidance of
[SPEAKER_01]: her tech, gave John Johnson, and it was a
wonderful and enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to finally do some wet lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I could do anything with that
data, I had some work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with allopolyploids is difficult,
because essentially, you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_01]: genome that contains two divergent genomes
of different evolutionary histories,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes things like phylogenetic and
population genetic analysis difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used a somewhat unorthodox approach
that I adapted from a Bomberli et al paper
[SPEAKER_01]: on soy bean, creating a pseudo-reference
using my diploid RadSeq data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that by mapping it first to a
reference assembly from Isoides
[SPEAKER_01]: inglomanii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled out regions where both diploid
parents mapped, and then I took those
[SPEAKER_01]: mapped reads and created my
pseudo-reference assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took that pseudo-reference assembly
and mapped my polyploid reads to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reads that map differentially to one
parent or the other were then retained for
[SPEAKER_01]: downstream analysis and treated basically
as separate diploid populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first analysis I did was a principal
components analysis, and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: basically just to make sure that my
phasing approach sort of worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it appears to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that the Appalachian loci in
green and yellow tend to cluster with
[SPEAKER_01]: their diploid parent like I would expect
them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following this, I also constructed a
phylogeny to look for evidence of
[SPEAKER_01]: recurrent formation of these lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, I'm just doing this by
counting monophyletic claves of Isoides
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachiana that are separated from their
diploid relatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at this tree, we can easily
infer four different formation events that
[SPEAKER_01]: led to the current distribution of Isoides
Appalachiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I meant to mark these with
asterisks or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little hard to look at,
I acknowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly, despite this recurrent
formation of Isoides Appalachiana in every
[SPEAKER_01]: single case from our chloroplast tree,
we see that Isoides Inglomanii is the
[SPEAKER_01]: maternal parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say this is surprising because there
is evidence that at least between species
[SPEAKER_01]: of equal ploidy, that either parent is
equally likely to be the maternal versus
[SPEAKER_01]: paternal parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, in species of differing
ploidy, differences in sizes of the sperm
[SPEAKER_01]: means that polyploid sperm cannot fit
through the archegonial neck cells of the
[SPEAKER_01]: diploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in crosses between polyploid and
diploid, we basically always see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploid is the maternal parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: While these are both diploid, it's
possible that there are differences in the
[SPEAKER_01]: anatomy of these archegonial neck cells or
in the size of their sperm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, another study found that the
formation of these archegonia can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: widely between species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the study did not include
Isoides Valida, but it did find that
[SPEAKER_01]: Isoides Inglomanii is particularly
prolific and good at forming these
[SPEAKER_01]: archegonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible that Isoides Inglomanii
just forms a lot more archegonia than
[SPEAKER_01]: Isoides Valida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm less likely to sample polyploids
that were formed in the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another sort of surprising result is that
we found no evidence for isolation by
[SPEAKER_01]: distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by this is that as
populations get more geographically
[SPEAKER_01]: distant, they do not tend to also get more
genetically distant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is counterintuitive at first
because we expect Isoides to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: dispersal limited, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only disperse passively through the
water or occasionally maybe conduct long
[SPEAKER_01]: distance dispersal on migrating waterfowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I honestly expected there to be quite
a bit of structure here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an explanation for this,
though, and I think it's a relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: simple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for something like Isoides
that is so dispersal limited, one mile is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically as good as 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as likely to disperse to that pond
one county over as it is to ride on a
[SPEAKER_01]: goose two states over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we see this pretty flat
distribution where we have very distant
[SPEAKER_01]: populations that are relatively similar,
but also populations that are very close
[SPEAKER_01]: together that are very distant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last analysis I'm going to talk about
today is my admixture analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is to look for evidence of gene
flow within these species of Isoides,
[SPEAKER_01]: either within the diploids, within the
polyploids, or possibly between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first plot is called an admixture
plot, and without going into too much
[SPEAKER_01]: detail because I think, oh, not that low
on time, without going into too much
[SPEAKER_01]: detail, essentially, you assign it a fixed
number of populations, in this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, you arrive at that number
using something called a cross entropy
[SPEAKER_01]: plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also use biologically
informative numbers if you sampled from 20
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could try to assign these to 20
ancestral populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we went with the one that
was identified by cross entropy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it tries to assign
each of these individuals to an ancestral
[SPEAKER_01]: population, but can also assign a single
individual to multiple ancestral
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, which we might infer as
evidence of admixture, either in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: or ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that in Isoides and Glomanii,
almost all of these blocks are a solid
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are kind of these multicolored tails
at the bottoms of them, but those are
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly associated with missing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: As missing data increases, those little
rainbow tails on the ends of them get
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see at least one instance from
admixture plots that appears to show gene
[SPEAKER_01]: flow between these individuals in DW86 and
111 and these polyploid individuals at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue with this is that these are
diploids and these are polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't expect this to be evidence of
ongoing gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, what I interpret this as is
historic gene flow between the diploid
[SPEAKER_01]: progenitors of those polyploids and
perhaps the diploid ancestors of these
[SPEAKER_01]: diploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other analysis that we used,
one of the other analyses that we used,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I'm not talking about it all today,
are these reticulate phylogenies made in a
[SPEAKER_01]: program called SplittsTree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we make these because while all the
trees I've shown you today have been these
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of branching, bifurcating trees,
that's not really how evolution works,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly within species, we expect
there to be lots of gene flow between
[SPEAKER_01]: different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expect these things to be able to
reproduce with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, those branches on that
neatly bifurcating tree would have lines
[SPEAKER_01]: drawn between them, right, showing
evidence of that gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we do see these diploid
individuals kind of come out on a branch
[SPEAKER_01]: and might show some reticulation with
those polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing that we see is these,
despite not showing any evidence of
[SPEAKER_01]: admixture in our bar plot, these
individuals here, which are all polyploids
[SPEAKER_01]: from central Pennsylvania and northern
Maryland, show a high degree of admixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pointing that out because it's
also something that we're going to see on
[SPEAKER_01]: future plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing I want to mention before I
move on are these large blocks of color we
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these large blocks of color actually
comprise multiple sites that I sampled,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which span multiple watersheds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while, once again, this could be
evidence of ongoing admixture between
[SPEAKER_01]: these populations, the distances are large
enough that I would also argue this could
[SPEAKER_01]: just be example of recent dispersal of a
single ancestral population, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could just represent multiple
dispersal events of a single population as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to ongoing gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the same analysis shown for
Isoides valida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has even more taxa, so even harder to
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just look at the colors,
we see a lot more evidence of admixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still very limited, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, this is still a plot
dominated by large single blocks of color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of these blocks typically
represents a single site or a single
[SPEAKER_01]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we still see these polyploid
accessions from central Pennsylvania and
[SPEAKER_01]: northern Maryland clustering together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I can't say definitively whether or
not there is admixture going on just from
[SPEAKER_01]: this data, but it seems like the most
likely example of gene flow between
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploid populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do see one really excellent example
of gene flow between two diploid
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this involves these samples,
DW90.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are from the Cheat River in West
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sampled six individuals from this
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them come out in this large group
that, again, does span multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: watersheds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them come out in this very small
group with another site from a creek
[SPEAKER_01]: located nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two of them show a mixed ancestry
between the two, almost perfectly mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would argue that this is really good
evidence of one instance where we see
[SPEAKER_01]: active admixture and gene flow going on
between two different populations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheat River.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my only big long text slide in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In conclusion, we see that polyploid form
very frequently in this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite that, we don't see any evidence of
reciprocal formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isoides appears to be severely limited by
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just based on those admixture plots,
we see that there is evidence of some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of long-range dispersal, at least
infrequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite that capacity for long-range
dispersal, admixture seems rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any really concrete cases
where we can absolutely say that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: an example of ongoing admixture between
these populations, except for that one
[SPEAKER_01]: example from Isoides Valida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does this all mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to what I said earlier about
conservation, it seems to support this
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that despite polyploids forming very
frequently, we see them being successful
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty rarely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's true, I think that this,
the fact that they form frequently,
[SPEAKER_01]: that these polyploids are important
members of the ecosystems where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: found, suggests a diploid-first approach,
by which I don't mean we should forget
[SPEAKER_01]: about the polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that preserving the processes that
recurrently generate the polyploid is more
[SPEAKER_01]: important than preserving one population
or another per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by conserving those processes,
we increase the chance that some polyploid
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages might eventually be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if those polyploid lineages serve an
important role in their community,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they'll continue to exist without
perhaps wasting resources focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: small or narrowly distributed polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I have a lot of people to
acknowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, my collaborators,
both at the Chinese Academy of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Science, at the Chinese
Academy of Forestry, at JGI and the Salk
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute for all of their help assembling
these genomes and with downstream analyses
[SPEAKER_01]: we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at BTI and the Lee Lab,
who's helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people at the Smithsonian for teaching
me how to do wet lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob for letting me just talk about
biomechanics, drop into his office
[SPEAKER_01]: basically any time and ask him ridiculous
questions about bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other Jacob for letting me ask him
ridiculous questions about Isoides,
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of other people I need
to thank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acknowledgements isn't even a strong
enough word, so I made another slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot thank Leila enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's put up with so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's listened to us ramble about plant
evolution nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's put up with me being stressed and
late nights and early mornings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so grateful and couldn't have done
any of this without her.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family, I literally would not be here
without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came all the way here from Kansas to
see me give this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also Leila's family, who came all the way
from Penzaken despite probably
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding very little of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the lovely people that I've met
since coming to Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: You supported me through a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me through a dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't be more grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much and I'm happy to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a quick question at the end on
conservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to plants like just doubling
their genomes, can you tell from the
[SPEAKER_03]: outside very easily in terms of like if
you took a behaviorist approach in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of them fitting into this larger
ecological niche, do the diploid just do
[SPEAKER_03]: the same stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question and one that I
actually had intended to address more
[SPEAKER_01]: directly with this this project kind of
got pushed off and off and off because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think an important component of this
analysis that I didn't do is looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the niches that the polyploids occupy
versus the diploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other species, right, there's evidence
that diploids really are just filling in
[SPEAKER_01]: space left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, polyploids are just filling in
space left behind by the diploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also other studies that show
that polyploids are capable of kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: inhabiting these new environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spreading to higher elevations or higher
latitudes, in which case they would be
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as if you can just, you know,
tell them apart generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: In isoides, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other plants, to varying degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of what I'm talking about here is
allopolyploidy, which also involves
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those hybrids can be easier to
determine from their polyploid relatives
[SPEAKER_01]: than the other case, which is just
duplication of a single gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that's an important part
of this project that I would like to do
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think would give us a lot more
insight into the conservation implications
[SPEAKER_01]: of preserving one or the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: When so many humans like try some of these
diseases, most of the time, plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently, they double their genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as to the difference in animals,
I'm not sure how well I can comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in plants, I mean, there are a lot of
immediate consequences of polyploidy in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the things that I mentioned,
right, like a multisomic inheritance,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad pairing of chromosomes at meiosis can,
in fact, have deleterious effects on some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these polyploid lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene silencing is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, allopolyploids tend to be more
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that plant's ability to be
so promiscuous and produce so many hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: is also helpful because those
allopolyploids have less problems with
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome pairing at meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think in ferns, certainly,
it's been shown that sort of the immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: silencing of a lot of genes is very
important to polyploids immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: following that whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really interesting multidisciplinary
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the tree ferns, in the allosophila,
you found high synteny, but low synteny in
[SPEAKER_02]: two other homosperous ferns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think one explanation could be the
life history, the fact that these are
[SPEAKER_02]: long-lived?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that is something that we
suggest in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original study that used
chloroplast data and found those reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: substitution rates in sciatiales suggested
that it was linked not only to generation
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but to arborescence per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there have been other studies in
angiosperms that find that substitution
[SPEAKER_01]: rate is correlated to things like plant
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not just to the generation time of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely think that life history is
at play, certainly in the substitution
[SPEAKER_01]: rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, while I don't think there's
necessarily a direct link between them,
[SPEAKER_01]: also possibly in the synteny being
preserved over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Related to that question, it got me
thinking about the same thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the old-fashioned idea of adaptive gene
complexes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are these genes hanging together
versus not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in a lot of cases, hybridization,
for example, breaks apart adaptive
[SPEAKER_04]: complexes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering, in these arborescent
ferns, what's different about being sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of, quote, woody, being like a tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Versus being a more herbaceous type fern?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and it's possible it has something
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about the difference
in gene expression between, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the woody ferns versus the more herbaceous
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, we did analyze gene
expression in Alsopolis spinulosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that was interesting
is we didn't necessarily, when we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that were located on two different
chromosomes, we didn't necessarily see any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of bias, which I think is unusual in
polyploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think typically in polyploids,
both ancient and recent, you do see a bias
[SPEAKER_01]: very early on that then sort of persists
between genes that are either along the
[SPEAKER_01]: same chromosome or originate from the same
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't see that in Alsopolo,
which is unusual.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a question, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you calibrate your trees to get
400 million years, 200 million years?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those calibrations actually are
secondary calibrations that we took from a
[SPEAKER_01]: paper by Wes Testo et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be fair, most of their calibrations
were much deeper in the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had very few calibrations that were
actually in the Lycopodiaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's by far the most fossil
calibrations that have been used in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lycophyte tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to calibrate the crown
age of lycophytes and also, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: the crown age of Lycopodiaceae,
just not within that group very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other papers have gotten much younger
estimates for that, but most of them had
[SPEAKER_01]: much lower sampling of lycophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weren't really focused on lycophyte
diversification per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing about the Testo paper is it
has really good species sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried a lot of different clock
approaches using a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: phylogenetic methods to kind of try to
settle on that date.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree it's controversial that
they're quite that old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I guess that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the Lycopodiaceae, you have very,
very low rates of chromosome rearrangement
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to genomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you touched on substitution
rates, but I didn't quite pick up on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that also low, or is it kind of
comparable to, like, oligonella
[SPEAKER_06]: comparative genomics?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it's low compared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did it compared to all of the
heterosporous lycophytes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We compared substitution rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compared to all of them together,
it's much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even when we compare
independently to either selaginella or to
[SPEAKER_01]: isoides, the Lycopodiaceae have
considerably lower substitution rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though, the same paper by Testo et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at substitution rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does vary a fair amount within the
Lycopodiaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have noticed that in that tree,
there were a couple branches that were a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot longer than the others in the
Lycopodiaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's evidence of the fact
that there are a couple of groups within
[SPEAKER_01]: Lycopodiaceae that do seem to have
accelerated rates of substitution relative
[SPEAKER_01]: to the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a whole, they seem much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be really interesting to look
at the genomes in those plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgive me if it was, like, said and I
missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you also for what a wonderful
thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: And congratulations.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question, I'm sorry, it's so basic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't understand the basis for the
hypothesis that a homosperous fern would
[SPEAKER_05]: be expected to have a larger, yeah,
would be expected to have a larger genome
[SPEAKER_05]: than a heterosperous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, as to why they would be
expected to, there are a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: theories that have to do with things like
intergovernetophytic selfing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That maybe they're keeping a lot more
chromosomes around, a lot more chromosomal
[SPEAKER_01]: material around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because intergovernetophytic selfing is
going to render a lot of sites homozygous,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to end up with more sort of
recessive lethal problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe just by keeping more chromosomes
around, right, they're staving that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that this is sort of something
that's been revisited a few times as to
[SPEAKER_01]: why exactly they'll be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is they just
have really large chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everywhere you look across
homosperous plants, again, their genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are three to four times the size of
heterosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the why is a little more
complicated, and I don't have a great
[SPEAKER_01]: answer for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost done, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
