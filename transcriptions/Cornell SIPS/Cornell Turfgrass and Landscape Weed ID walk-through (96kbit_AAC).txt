[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello there, my name is Carl Scamenti with
the Cornell Turfgrass Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to walk everyone through
how to use our turf and landscape weed ID
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an online resource that Dr. Jenny
Kowniffen here at Cornell, our weed
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist, developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gotten a lot of great help over the
years from people like Grant Thompson,
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria Gannett, Leah Butler-Jones,
who has most recently put a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: into this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today what I want to do is just walk
everybody through how to use the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do that with a weed I
went out and found this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's early April, went out in the
backyard and found this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw it up here in the top
right hand corner of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to go ahead and use
the website and try and figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: this weed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, you know, I just typed in
Cornell weed ID on Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first thing that pops up is our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and click on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got our first decision here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it a grass like or broadleaf weed
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, pretty obviously,
as you can see up here, this looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go ahead and click that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this brings me to kind of the main
screen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see I've got 118 results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's, you know, you can see each
weed, the name and just a general picture
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if I wanted to, I could go
and click on each one of these and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what I'm going to use is this
stuff on the left hand side of the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: here, all these traits that are going to
help me whittle down what weed it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm looking at this weed,
and you may or may not be able to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in the top right, but I see a lot
of hairiness and fuzziness in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to see if any one of these
characteristics over here on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: describes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tactile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see smooth, fuzzy and rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that fuzzy texture is
definitely what I'm seeing on my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've narrowed things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went from 118 to only 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I could go ahead and scroll
through all these and see if they match my
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to go one more step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stature thing looks like a
trait I can narrow things down with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on what I saw outside,
spreading is the trait it's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're down to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of these looks definitely
like my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me check some other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: First common mallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got some of the traits I selected,
but definitely doesn't look like my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf shape isn't quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow hawkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing that in my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not like my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, mouse hair chickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I think everybody can see,
this has got the hairiness on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely resembles what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each weed on the website has
multiple pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Countiff and her team have done a
really good job of putting in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the seed size if you want to
get really specific what it looks like as
[SPEAKER_00]: a seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty quick way to identify mouse hair
chickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can go down here, some
information on life cycle and traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I can also look at
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scroll down here, and I've got control
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conventional pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are New York specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't have a certain herbicide
label in New York, it's not going to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got reduced risk and
minimum risk options, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for K through 12 managers, K through 12
grounds managers here in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have restrictions on conventional
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, they're limited to these
reduced or minimum risk options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way to use this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you to a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can learn a little bit more about
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I like, and it's a new
feature on this website, is the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: free management tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something Aliyah Butler-Jones
has worked a lot on recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, geared towards our K through 12
managers, where they've got these unique
[SPEAKER_00]: situations, fence lines, gravels,
mulch areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can go in here, and we can learn
about non-pesticide ways to control weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you options for mechanical
control, barriers, how you're going to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up that fence line in a way that's going
to allow you to manage those weeds better
[SPEAKER_00]: and more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal weeding, something we've studied
here at our turf grass program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal weeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's burn those plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some options, things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great addition to this website,
I think, has been this pesticide free
[SPEAKER_00]: management area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are kind of problem areas
where you're going to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: non-pesticide products and their control
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quick overview of the Turf and
Landscape Weed ID website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone found that useful,
and hopefully you can keep this place
[SPEAKER_00]: bookmarked in your browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I did it on the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, of course, do it on your phone
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always available if you're out in the
field and looking to do something out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everyone has found this helpful,
and thanks for watching.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
