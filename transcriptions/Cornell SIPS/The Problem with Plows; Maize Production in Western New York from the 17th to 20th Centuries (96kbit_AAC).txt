[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
I
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to start with, particularly
agricultural historians, often will
[SPEAKER_06]: indicate that plows are one of the markers
of a civilized agriculture, a more
[SPEAKER_06]: developed agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: This first is a quote from Hirt,
who is an American agricultural historian,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you see here his quote, you know,
through the ages the plow has been the
[SPEAKER_06]: most important agricultural tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed, without it, farmers could not till
the soil and prepare their fields for
[SPEAKER_06]: extensive agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even more closer to home, our own
Liberty Hyde Bailey said that tillage is
[SPEAKER_06]: so universal and so obviously essential to
successful agriculture that we accept it
[SPEAKER_06]: without questioning its origin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet among modern farmers tillage is rarely
practiced with sufficient frequency to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce the best results.
[SPEAKER_06]: But prior to colonization, farmers in the
Western Hemisphere had no access to plows
[SPEAKER_06]: nor to draft animals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet they had very both extensive and
intensive agriculture that was
[SPEAKER_06]: accomplished completely by hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm showing you three pictures here,
one from Machu Picchu of Incan agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: on terraces, another two from Mayan and
also Aztec agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, intensive agriculture, but without
plows involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last picture in the corner,
the black and white, is a drawing by a
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesuit who was visiting Mohawk country in
the 17th century.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a picture of a Mohawk woman
with a hand tool, also probably planted
[SPEAKER_06]: corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I wanted to do this afternoon,
we have a unique opportunity to look at
[SPEAKER_06]: the effects of tillage in one place over
several hundred years, both agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: with and without tillage, right here in
kind of Western New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to start out with a Mohawks who
were growing corn over closer to the
[SPEAKER_06]: Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a quote in a journal by a
Dutchman, Adrian Cornelison van der Donk,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he was in the Hudson Valley in 1653.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says, he wrote in his report,
the women do all the farming and planting.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grow no wheat, oats, barley,
rye, et cetera, and are unacquainted with
[SPEAKER_06]: plowing and spade work, and do not keep
their lands tidy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know nothing of maneuvering,
fallow seasons, and proper tillage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The labor they devote is all manual,
using small adzes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevertheless, they raise so much corn and
beans that we purchase these from them in
[SPEAKER_06]: fully loaded yachts and snoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is this indication of a
productive agriculture taking place here
[SPEAKER_06]: in what is today New York State,
that was done completely without plows and
[SPEAKER_06]: other types of mechanized or major tillage
operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to examine that in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who are not familiar
with the Mohawks, the Mohawks were one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the original five nations of the Iroquois
Confederacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the map on the right shows you what
those territories look like about 1650.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the map on the left shows the
Iroquois, Iroquoian language speakers,
[SPEAKER_06]: the kind of dark purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Iroquois Confederacy is part of a
larger group of native peoples who spoke
[SPEAKER_06]: similar language called the Iroquoian
languages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what it might have looked like
before Europeans first came.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see people of similar language,
the dark purple, inhabiting or residing in
[SPEAKER_06]: a fairly large portion of the northeast,
certainly all of New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go back once more here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I talked about the Mohawks and the
Mohawks were where we saw the first quote
[SPEAKER_06]: about how their agriculture was
productive, even though they knew nothing
[SPEAKER_06]: of plows or manures or fallows or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're gonna move west over into Kinga
and also Seneca territory.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a map of Iroquois, settlements
that were in existence sometime between
[SPEAKER_06]: 1350 to 1730.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I've done just for your kind of
orientation is to place Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_06]: Geneva and Rochester on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the triangles that are dark are ones
that were before 1550 and the ones that
[SPEAKER_06]: are light colored are those that were
occupied after 1550.
[SPEAKER_06]: Agriculture in Iroquois communities
intensified sometime about 1450 and
[SPEAKER_06]: onward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see is there was a kind of
concentration of many settlements along
[SPEAKER_06]: that kind of east-west axis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show you a little bit more of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at where the Iroquois
settlements were and where most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture was taking place, it's in this
broad area outlined in red here that
[SPEAKER_06]: happens to contain some of New York's most
agriculturally productive land.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at Iroquois maize and how it
was managed, we know that it was
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled by women, that the crops were
planted without plows, there are no draft
[SPEAKER_06]: animals, that the fields were continuously
cropped and that it was a highly
[SPEAKER_06]: productive agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might say, well what evidence do we
have of that productivity?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well they come from two areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, historical documents.
[SPEAKER_06]: The book on the right, General John
Sullivan's Indian Expedition of 1779,
[SPEAKER_06]: contains lots of the diaries and journals
of officers involved in the Sullivan
[SPEAKER_06]: campaign, which came up into Cayuga and
Seneca territories.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have available some contemporary
field experiments that I've done that have
[SPEAKER_06]: looked at what crop yields might have
been.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's look first at these historical
documents.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they come from two primary areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of them as a result of European
attacks, particularly on Seneca
[SPEAKER_06]: territories in both the 17th and 18th
centuries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And both of these incidents, these two
historical incidents about 100 years
[SPEAKER_06]: apart, provide us a lot of information on
maize productivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is Dinando.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the guy up there, 1687,
a Frenchman.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes into Ganondagan.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one in blue there that's
located, if you've been to the Ganondagan
[SPEAKER_06]: historical site in Western New York,
in Victor, New York, it's just south of
[SPEAKER_06]: Rochester.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was one of the major Iroquois,
major actually Seneca settlements at that
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Sullivan, 100 years later,
went all around Cayuga Lake, Seneca Lake,
[SPEAKER_06]: and but more specifically over into the
western part of New York through
[SPEAKER_06]: Canandaigua and one of the major areas
called Genesee Castle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well let's first look at Dinando.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a map that was made after his
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually has Sullivan's campaign on it
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he came down from Lake Ontario through
this area, what today is Rochester,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then he began marching on quite a
large army down into Seneca territories.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for doing this was that the
Seneca were collaborating and allied
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves with Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And France and Great Britain were at war
over who was gonna control North America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dinando knew that the Seneca had large
fields of corn and that they were
[SPEAKER_06]: supplying British troops with corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was coming down in order to try to
destroy and to frighten, intimidate,
[SPEAKER_06]: and reduce the capacity of these Seneca
villages from providing English soldiers
[SPEAKER_06]: with food.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Ganondagan was the site of a major
granary story in the storage area and was
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of the heart of Seneca May's
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well Dinando reported in letters back to
his superiors in France that over nine
[SPEAKER_06]: days he and his men destroyed over a
million bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that it was both stored corn and corn
that was green in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see what he writes here about
after having destroyed a vast quantity of
[SPEAKER_06]: fine large corn, beans, and other
vegetables of which there remained not a
[SPEAKER_06]: single field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after having burned so large a
quantity of old corn that would be stored
[SPEAKER_06]: corn that the amount dare not be
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quantity of corn which we found in
store in this place and destroyed by fire
[SPEAKER_06]: is incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we have one picture of a
fairly detailed description of what
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture looked like in Major Seneca,
areas where they were growing corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: About a hundred years later, John Sullivan
comes into almost the exact same area but
[SPEAKER_06]: he makes a much more extensive trip
through central and western New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was ordered by George Washington
who gave him these instructions in a
[SPEAKER_06]: letter in early 1779, in May of 1779.
[SPEAKER_06]: He writes that the immediate objectives
are the total destruction and devastation
[SPEAKER_06]: of their settlements, meaning primarily
Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be essential to groom their crops
in the ground and prevent their planting
[SPEAKER_06]: more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for this once again was
that the majority of the Iroquois,
[SPEAKER_06]: four out of six nations, had sided with
Great Britain in the Revolutionary War.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again they were supplying British
soldiers with corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sullivan is, is ordered to go up into
this area and destroy villages and the
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these little dotted lines show where,
where he went.
[SPEAKER_06]: There actually a couple of them came,
Clinton came from this direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sullivan came farther from farther south
in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_06]: They went up, this would be Cayuga Lake
and Seneca Lake, first going up along the
[SPEAKER_06]: eastern side of Seneca, going all the way
out west to what is today Geneseo,
[SPEAKER_06]: coming back down along the western side of
Cayuga Lake and then up along the eastern
[SPEAKER_06]: side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of the time burning villages and
more importantly destroying corn fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well out of this, this campaign we have
the diaries and journals of a number of
[SPEAKER_06]: the officers who participated in this
campaign.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just picked out, I think there's
six here, five, that all are from late
[SPEAKER_06]: August and they were in primarily areas
around Geneseo, a little to the east of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Geneseo, Onondaga, and a bit
farther west.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the, these, you know, officers
described the corn that, that they saw,
[SPEAKER_06]: the agriculture that they saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see the quotes, 150 acres of the
best corn I ever saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: In such quantities would be almost
incredible to a civilized people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some corn stalks measuring 18 feet and a
cob's one, one foot and a half long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We found 200 acres of exceedingly good
corn intermixed with beans and squashes,
[SPEAKER_06]: pompeons and a few potatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We destroyed large fields of their corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: They plant with as much exactness as any
farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a very detailed picture of productive
and extensive agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not backyard gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are large agricultural fields,
100, 150 acres, 200 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there were, there were,
there were records or quotes from these
[SPEAKER_06]: officers that they went, they saw corn
fields that were more than a mile in
[SPEAKER_06]: length.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a huge amount of, of, you know,
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on, and obviously indicative of a,
of a, of a fairly productive and
[SPEAKER_06]: high-yielding agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's part of what the information
from historical documents tells us.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also have some from field
experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is work that I started back in
1993 and carried through to 1997.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it at two sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: One right in this area in Cayuga County.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the Musgrave Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other outside of this very highly,
you know, productive area in Talkins
[SPEAKER_06]: County on a farm about eight miles east
and south of Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today I'm just going to show you the
results from Cayuga.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think they are most,
you know, representative of what,
[SPEAKER_06]: of what Iroquois farmers would have been
able to achieve since they're in the same
[SPEAKER_06]: area, same climate, same soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we used a maize variety, an open
pollinated white flower corn that is still
[SPEAKER_06]: grown by, by Iroquois people today.
[SPEAKER_06]: From everything that we know, it is very
similar to what was grown here,
[SPEAKER_06]: probably in the 15, 16, 17, and 1800s.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's quite similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an open pollinated variety,
has a much lower yield potential than do
[SPEAKER_06]: our, our modern hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used agronomic practices that were
as similar as we could make them to what
[SPEAKER_06]: the Iroquois would have used in the 17th
and 18th centuries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried for populations and for spacing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did some, some variations.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we tried for, for things that we
thought would, would be realistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are from two years in Cayuga
County.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had two different populations,
10,000 and 20,000 plants per, per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we planted them at two different
spacings.
[SPEAKER_06]: One a 40 inch and a 60 inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we found in both years was that
the highest yields, not surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_06]: came from the narrow spacing in the high
population.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so at the very highest fields,
we were getting close to 75 bushels per
[SPEAKER_06]: acre, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the very lowest at the, in 96 at
10,000 plants and a wide spacing,
[SPEAKER_06]: about 35, 38 bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we saw that as, as there's all sorts of
indications that the Iroquois planted at
[SPEAKER_06]: fairly high populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my guess is that the, you know,
40 inches and 20,000 plants per acre is
[SPEAKER_06]: probably realistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so somewhere between 50 to 75 bushels
per acre is probably a fairly typical
[SPEAKER_06]: yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question immediately is,
are these yields realistic?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is, you know, talking about 50 to 75
bushels per acre of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: Iroquois corn, how does this match up with
what we know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have plenty of records that under
good management, open pollinated maize in
[SPEAKER_06]: the United States in the 19th and early,
early 20th centuries, frequently yielded
[SPEAKER_06]: 75 to 100 bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the important words there are good
management.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these were on fields that were even,
in fact, we have records of 200 bushels
[SPEAKER_06]: per acre in the 19th century in New York
State and open pollinated corn,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are in fields that were either
newly opened, meaning they had not been
[SPEAKER_06]: previously cultivated or they had been
rotated and or received applications of,
[SPEAKER_06]: of animal waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: But many people in the field of
particularly anthropology would find fault
[SPEAKER_06]: with this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look in, in the literature of what
yields are purported to be amongst Native
[SPEAKER_06]: Americans in both generally North America,
but more specifically in Eastern,
[SPEAKER_06]: Eastern and Central North America,
their yields are much, much lower,
[SPEAKER_06]: what they estimate the yields to have
been.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the major persons who's been
doing this work is an anthropologist at
[SPEAKER_06]: Wisconsin Schroeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says in a, in an article from
1999, that 10 to 15 bushels per acre was
[SPEAKER_06]: typical and that other people that had
been claiming either, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 to 30 bushels per acre or even,
you know, much above 15, that this was an
[SPEAKER_06]: exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Heidenrich and Trigger are people,
are two anthropologists who have studied
[SPEAKER_06]: the Huron, who are closely related in
Ontario and their work indicated 15 to 25
[SPEAKER_06]: bushels per acre of corn was what they
thought would be typical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Baden was working in Tennessee at
an earlier time with Mississippian period
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This would have probably been around 1300.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he surmised or estimated that the
yields would have been in the range of 12
[SPEAKER_06]: to 25 bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the rationale for, for these
estimates?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all three, all four of these
scholars have based their estimates on
[SPEAKER_06]: yields that U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: and Canadian farmers would get when they
grow corn continuously on plowed fields,
[SPEAKER_06]: but without adding fertilizers or any
other source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these modern farmers, when they were
questioned, indicated that their corn
[SPEAKER_06]: yields declined quite steadily after five
years or less of continuous corn without
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_06]: You grow corn for five years and plow
every year on land that's not been manured
[SPEAKER_06]: or received other, you know, nitrogen
sources, yields go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they surmised from that that native
farmers would have experienced the same
[SPEAKER_06]: yield reductions, forcing them to either
open new lands in what people think of as
[SPEAKER_06]: typical of north of, of the entire western
hemisphere, shifting cultivation,
[SPEAKER_06]: or to accept declining yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would challenge that in
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I challenge it primarily because they
have neglected the role of organic matter
[SPEAKER_06]: and tillage in soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_06]: In pre-industrial cropping systems,
plant nutrients, and here I'm talking
[SPEAKER_06]: exclusively about nitrogen because I think
this is the key, the absolute,
[SPEAKER_06]: the controller of, of corn yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three ways that farmers can,
can get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal waste, legumes, or soil organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, native farmers in, in the Americas
didn't have animal waste and they didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have legumes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have forages to rely on
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: They relied exclusively on soil organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And tillage plays a key role in the
ability of soil organic matter to provide
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So without considering the role of tillage
in soil organic matter, the explanations
[SPEAKER_06]: and the rationales that these other
scholars have presented don't really stand
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's why.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know this is a, a graph from Brady and
Wild, The Nature and Property of Soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably if you've taken a look at it,
in the soils course you've seen this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This shows the effects of tillage on soil
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we start out at, and on the left-hand
side, if that axis is the amount of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter in tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the horizontal axis is increasing
time, going from zero up to 130 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the soil organic matter is divided
into these different components.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, plant residues in the very bright
green, then the active organic matter,
[SPEAKER_06]: then slow organic matter, and then what
they term the passive organic matter pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost all of the nitrogen that is
released upon decomposition of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter comes from everything but
the passive organic matter pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, this is pretty,
it does great things in terms of structure
[SPEAKER_06]: and other, other things for, for soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in terms of providing nitrogen,
almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the nitrogen comes from,
from these areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very fast from plant residues and very
fast from the active organic matter,
[SPEAKER_06]: more slowly under, with the, the slow
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we see is that with time,
these pools go down very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by 10 years, we've seen a very steep
decline in the total amount of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And almost all of that loss has been from
the portion that provides nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Notice here we get out to a, a place where
it, it plateaus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually this would be about 2% soil
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point, the soil's ability to
release nitrogen for uptake by plants has
[SPEAKER_06]: almost bottomed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we were looking at yields,
they would go along the same place,
[SPEAKER_06]: staying pretty high up here, but then all
of a sudden they're going to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they would parallel this line,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So your yields will, will go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll still get something, but your
yields will drop quite strongly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Notice here, organic matter, organic
matter management improved or the land is
[SPEAKER_06]: put back into native vegetation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these active sources begin to rebuild.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you cultivate it again when you
were over here, you would get an increase
[SPEAKER_06]: in crop yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that when we plow, we initially
increase soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go into a land that has not
previously been plowed, then you will get
[SPEAKER_06]: really nice yields if the soil organic
matter levels are reasonably high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because we get the oxidation of the
soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: That oxidation releases nitrogen in forms
that can, that plants can take up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since nitrogen is usually the most
limiting nutrient for cereal grains,
[SPEAKER_06]: yields increase.
[SPEAKER_06]: And plowing fields that have been fallowed
or pastured and allowed to accumulate soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter is a reliable mechanism for
providing nitrogen to crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's used worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem happens when we continue to
plow and plow and plow, and we get on this
[SPEAKER_06]: downward curve.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't add some other source of
nitrogen or we don't rebuild the soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less nitrogen gets released every year and
grain yields inevitably decline.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these soils eventually reach what,
about a 2% soil organic matter in which no
[SPEAKER_06]: further loss happens, but then there very
little nitrogen is released at that
[SPEAKER_06]: plateau.
[SPEAKER_06]: And farmers will typically call these
soils worn out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that the single largest cause of
decreased soil organic matter in
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural fields is plowing tillage.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so let's begin to put all of
these pieces together.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned before, the Iroquois were
growing their, their maize in this area of
[SPEAKER_06]: central New York that we know is our most
productive soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the reasons that we, we,
those soils are productive is that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: alphasols.
[SPEAKER_06]: This first map shows all of the alphasols
in, in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pay any attention to, to the
different colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are just moisture regimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But notice, alphasols right there in the
center of New York state.
[SPEAKER_06]: No surprise that those are our most
agriculturally productive soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our other large group, and even better
soils, are mollisols.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those are located more towards the
west and in the, you know, center part of,
[SPEAKER_06]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: But notice also that the good soils in the
eastern part of the country, there's not
[SPEAKER_06]: much of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: These alphasols are here in parts of
Pennsylvania and a little smattering of
[SPEAKER_06]: them down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's not a lot of good agricultural
land on the eastern seaboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Iroquois were very fortunate to be
residing in that area of really nice
[SPEAKER_06]: soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're growing maize on these high
productive soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, what would happen if
you grew corn continuously on these
[SPEAKER_06]: alphasols, but without tillage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would we expect to see a decline in crop
yields?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say, it depends on two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, what is the initial level of the
soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: And second, how much corn are you taking
off?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your yield levels?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the things that we control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very hard to find information on
unplowed alphasols.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't exist, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what I can gather, a 4% soil
organic matter would be a conservative
[SPEAKER_06]: estimate of what an unplowed alphasol
would contain.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would release somewhere between 80 to
160 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that from precipitation and
decomposition of plant residues,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could probably get another 15 to 30.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this gives us a total available of
somewhere between 100 and 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at how much nitrogen we're
taking off, 75 bushels per acre of maize
[SPEAKER_06]: removes somewhere between 75 to 125 pounds
of nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we know always that we have to have
more nitrogen than what the plant actually
[SPEAKER_06]: takes up, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know you have to have more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's clear that we have one and a half
to two times as much nitrogen in this
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we could take off 75 bushels per acre
of nitrogen every year, provided that the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil organic matter level stays at 4%,
meaning that the land is not plowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that there is no need for additional
nitrogen inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, that farmers in Iracoina,
in 1687 when Dinango came down,
[SPEAKER_06]: could have had great high yields and 100
years later, perhaps even in that same
[SPEAKER_06]: field, farmers could have still been
getting 50, 75, perhaps even 100 bushels
[SPEAKER_06]: of corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that holds it together is
the fact that they're not plowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, but things change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Iracoina were dispossessed of their land
after the Revolutionary War.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this dispossession sets up an
opportunity for us to look at,
[SPEAKER_06]: to have our own experiment of what happens
when farmers come in and use plots.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens to corn yields then,
particularly if they're using the same
[SPEAKER_06]: types of open pollinator varieties,
which they were, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what the map on the left is
what things looked like in 1720.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 100 years later, the Iroquois had
been reduced to these small, these small
[SPEAKER_06]: territories, reservations, and U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers have flooded into the area,
taking over these areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at this map today, the areas of
land that Iroquois people control would be
[SPEAKER_06]: probably about 25% of this, even small.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get this sweep into what had been
Iroquois country and now becomes New York
[SPEAKER_06]: State.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 1799, there was efforts by land
speculators to try to determine what the
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural potential of this area was
called.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they referred to it as the Genesee
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we get these reports of people
visiting this land who were looking to
[SPEAKER_06]: make, to first to sell it to farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanted to know what the
agricultural potential of it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is a, there's a whole
series of what are called letters from a
[SPEAKER_06]: gentleman to his friend in 1799.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a land speculator.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's telling other speculators kind of
what he thinks the agricultural potential
[SPEAKER_06]: of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says, the flats of the Genesee
River and the Kanisraga Creek alone cannot
[SPEAKER_06]: be estimated at less than 80 miles in
length and about two in breadth,
[SPEAKER_06]: boarding a body of about 8,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every acre is, I suppose, 18 feet
wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Deep, a black mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration,
but if you've been out in the Genesee
[SPEAKER_06]: Valley and looked at some of those soils,
you know, not much, it's pretty nice
[SPEAKER_06]: looking soils out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said in such land, the Indians raise
100 bushels of corn on an acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they never have been known to make any
change of this spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, they're continuously
cropping and they're getting 100 bushels
[SPEAKER_06]: of corn per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this guy's trying to sell land,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's probably an exaggeration to it,
but not a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: More quotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The famous Genesee flats are about 20
miles in length and about four miles wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: The soil is remarkably rich, quite clear
of trees, and producing grass near ten
[SPEAKER_06]: feet high.
[SPEAKER_06]: In places we found openings of two and
three hundred acres, free from all timber
[SPEAKER_06]: and even bushes, which on our examining
proved to be of a rich soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Corn generally goes to the amount of 30 to
40 bushels on an acre, and on flats of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Genesee River and of Mud Creek,
it is said to the extent of 70 to 80
[SPEAKER_06]: bushels an acre, and is very heavy and
substantial in quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, even 30 to 40 bushels per
acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: What colonial farmers and early American
farmers had been getting, the typical
[SPEAKER_06]: yields along the eastern seaboard on those
worn out soils were lucky oftentimes to be
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 bushels to the acre of corn,
and usually around 10 to 15 of wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were coming from a perspective of
soil's not great, soils get worn out,
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't expect great yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, 30 to 40 bushels on an average
place, and on some of the better 70 to 80
[SPEAKER_06]: bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this last quote comes from McNally,
who wrote the agricultural history of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Genesee Valley, 1790 to 1860.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was written in 1952, and he kind of,
he sums up, he provides a picture of what
[SPEAKER_06]: it looked like.
[SPEAKER_06]: The information which they heard of the
Genesee country made it appear to land
[SPEAKER_06]: seekers a veritable agricultural paradise.
[SPEAKER_06]: The land was ready, and to the east,
farmers, pressed by circumstance,
[SPEAKER_06]: prepared to move into new areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were predominantly New Englanders
who had been trying to grow crops on
[SPEAKER_06]: spodosols and had not been having a great
deal of luck after the first flush of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter had been removed,
they were growing wheat, things were not
[SPEAKER_06]: looking good, they were hungry for new
land.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Genesee country looked like the answer
to farmers' dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 1810, the map there on your left shows
dots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each dot represents 100% in the Genesee
country, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see by 1860, the population has
just absolutely, I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_06]: total number is, but it's multiplied many,
many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The population just increases
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what the area looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes these counties, but I'm
concentrating mostly on these upper ones
[SPEAKER_06]: because this is where the more fertile
soils are.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Allegheny ones are down here,
getting into the southern tier,
[SPEAKER_06]: not as great soils, but the northern half
of the Genesee country is where these
[SPEAKER_06]: fertile soils are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after the entry of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers with their plow-based agriculture,
what happened to maize yields?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's very little information from
1800 to 1845 because the early New York
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural censuses don't provide crop
yield data.
[SPEAKER_06]: They provide production, but you don't
know on how many acres, so it's almost
[SPEAKER_06]: impossible to get any sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: But by 1845, average maize yields in the
best agricultural lands of western New
[SPEAKER_06]: York were less than 30 bushels an acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's look at what happens from 1845 to
1940.
[SPEAKER_06]: At Genesee, Livingston, Monroe,
Ontario, and I included Seneca,
[SPEAKER_06]: although that was not in the original
Genesee country, but it is one of our
[SPEAKER_06]: highest producing agricultural states and
certainly a place that the Iroquois were
[SPEAKER_06]: growing their crops as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see that in 1845, the yields are
considerably below 30 bushels per acre,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they kind of stutter along,
occasionally growing up a bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's not until, what is that,
1920 that we really get up to even
[SPEAKER_06]: approaching 50 bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: We begin to see some of these counties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now granted, these are averages.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are entire county averages.
[SPEAKER_06]: They include good farmers, poor farmers,
and in-between farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is no doubt that there were some
farmers that were getting better yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the more important question is,
what enabled this increase from 25 up to
[SPEAKER_06]: 50?
[SPEAKER_06]: What was going on that allowed that to
happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I get the head of myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: First we have to talk about why did the
yields decline?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what everybody would say is soil
depletion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is McNall.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the guy writing the history of the
agricultural history of the Genesee
[SPEAKER_06]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, New Englanders, remember,
those are the folks that were flooding in
[SPEAKER_06]: here predominantly, knew little of the
methods or importance of rotating crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: A three-crop system, rain, grass,
and fallow did little to maintain soil
[SPEAKER_06]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soil ameliorants were conspicuous.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were mostly neglected.
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal manures were not systematically and
carefully used.
[SPEAKER_06]: Artificial fertilizers were not employed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Says farmers, whether tilling the rich
soils of the Genesee or elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: were guilty of defective cropping
practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fertility of their lands was sapped by
repeated croppings, by poor rotation
[SPEAKER_06]: schemes, or none, and by the neglect of
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how did the yields increase?
[SPEAKER_06]: How did farmers get around this problem?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's the introduction of forage
legumes saves them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing happened in Europe with
European wheat farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not until they discovered clover
that plow agriculture becomes a
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainable practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US, it's predominantly clover and
later alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is combined with the more careful use
of animal manure, and this ameliorates the
[SPEAKER_06]: effects of intensive plowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forage legumes have very different
characteristics than do grain legumes,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's not good enough to just add a
bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a picture of peas here,
and over there is alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the difference in those two crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: The peas are an animal, and the amount of
organic matter biomass and nitrogen that
[SPEAKER_06]: they contribute to the following crop is
minimal.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, because we eat the pea,
and most of the nitrogen goes with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unless we're returning night soil to
the land, that nitrogen is lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, there's hardly any biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Third, that crop dies as soon as it's cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you go through and harvest the
peas and you cut that plant, it's growing
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: The growing period is over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now compare that with a crop like red
clover or alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, you're not removing the grain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's staying there.
[SPEAKER_06]: At most, you may be feeding it to an
animal and returning the waste back to the
[SPEAKER_06]: land.
[SPEAKER_06]: But more importantly, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time you cut it, it's like,
it says, whoopee, I can grow again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got a root system that allows it
to grow up again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can produce enormous amounts of
nitrogen-rich biomass that either get
[SPEAKER_06]: plowed back in or that you feed to an
animal and return the animal waste back.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that happens with forage
legumes is that you're not plowing
[SPEAKER_06]: annually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they have to be, they're
perennials.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes longer to get them seeded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmers keep them in for two to four
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you're not plowing those fields
annually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's an opportunity to greatly
increase soil organic matter because these
[SPEAKER_06]: crops remain in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: They reduce the amount of plowing and they
ameliorate or they repair the damage
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been caused by plowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, they supply nitrogen
to succeeding grain crops and to animals
[SPEAKER_06]: that you feed that forage to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So red clover is like the magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_06]: For farmers in western New York,
and it was primarily red clover and
[SPEAKER_06]: Timothy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some farmers were using this in the 18th
century, but it was not common.
[SPEAKER_06]: By 1839, New York led the nation in the
production of hay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bidwell, another agricultural
historian, says that in the wheat growing
[SPEAKER_06]: region of the western part of the state,
and he's talking about New York,
[SPEAKER_06]: it had been found that the growing of
clover and the grazing of hay of cattle
[SPEAKER_06]: and sheep on the depleted wheat lands
would greatly increase their yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the reason that that's
happening is because it's restoring soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it takes forage like this, along with
the tight integration of animals and
[SPEAKER_06]: crops, to make plow-based agricultural
systems in western New York both
[SPEAKER_06]: productive and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here are the conclusions that I would
draw from this.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, that airport maize was highly
productive and sustainable because first
[SPEAKER_06]: they were farming on these very fertile
alpha salts with high levels of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: The absence of plows, far from being a
disadvantage, was the reason that they
[SPEAKER_06]: were able to maintain their soil organic
matter because they weren't oxidizing it
[SPEAKER_06]: with intensive cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: New York farmers, on the other hand,
didn't have a chance of maintaining those
[SPEAKER_06]: yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: They likely got them early in the first
1800 to 1840.
[SPEAKER_06]: Likely yields, at least in the early
1800s, were quite reasonable when they
[SPEAKER_06]: moved on to those alpha salts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly by 1845, indication was that
the yields were, their maize yields were
[SPEAKER_06]: not good at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was caused by the reduction of
soil organic matter that was a result of
[SPEAKER_06]: continual tillage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lack of appropriate management
practices, including forages, manure and
[SPEAKER_06]: rotation, was also a part of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, solving that problem
required the introduction of forage
[SPEAKER_06]: nightmares.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll end there and I'm happy to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did the Iroquois or the native
peoples maintain their soil organic
[SPEAKER_04]: matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they must have done something to
get the corn into the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they must also have taken off that
yield because that's what they generally
[SPEAKER_04]: told us, they got a lot of maize off
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why is the soil organic matter not
being oxidized?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the most loss of soil organic
matter comes from tillage, not from crop
[SPEAKER_06]: removal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as the soil organic matter
stays at 4%, which there's no reason to
[SPEAKER_06]: think that it won't, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not plowing up a whole field,
there's no reason to think that it won't
[SPEAKER_06]: stay at 4%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, you're adding crop residues
back to that mound weeds, corn stalks are
[SPEAKER_06]: all going back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason to think that soil
organic matter levels are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: decline.
[SPEAKER_06]: The major loss of soil organic matter at
these yield levels comes from plowing,
[SPEAKER_06]: tillage, not soil removal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as soil organic matter levels
stay at 4%, the soil can continue to
release.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not the crop that's taking out all
that nitrogen, it's the plowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at how much nitrogen is in a
75 bushel acre yield of corn, it's
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere between 75 and maybe 125 pounds
per acre of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got more than enough in the soil
organic matter to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that some of it is getting
oxidized, but you're only doing a small
[SPEAKER_06]: amount and you're replacing lots of crop
residues back in that mound.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my argument is that the soil organic
matter could be stable, and that's what
[SPEAKER_06]: accounts for the sustainability of the
yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: How come they didn't spend all their time
weeding?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they didn't have the same weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost all of our nasty weeds came from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you look at the worst weeds,
no, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at the worst weeds in the
European imports, and they weren't
[SPEAKER_06]: plowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think we have so many weed
problems?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we plow, and we create ideal
conditions for weeds to germinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So without plowing, they weren't doing
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were not spreading weeds through
animal manure, which is the way most of
[SPEAKER_06]: the weeds got spread from Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came either with other stuff, eaten by
animals, spread hither and yon through
[SPEAKER_06]: animal waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those things were happening.
So they were pretty damn lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you take 80 to 100 pounds per acre
of nitrogen off of each crop, as you just
[SPEAKER_05]: indicated, what is the pool of nitrogen
that's in that until soil is termed with
[SPEAKER_05]: the same, how many hundred pounds per
acre?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically, if you believe Brady and
Weill, they say, I think that for every
[SPEAKER_06]: percent of soil organic matter,
you can get 20 to 40 pounds oxidized per
[SPEAKER_06]: year, released per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've got 4% soil organic matter,
you've got somewhere between 80 and 160
[SPEAKER_06]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not even as much as you took
off the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you only took off 75 to 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have additional coming from
precipitation and decomposition.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can plan on another 15 to 30 annual
contribution from precipitation and
[SPEAKER_06]: decomposition of plant residues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the crop residues, if you don't kill
them under, you're going to lose most of
[SPEAKER_06]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not true at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant residues do not volatilize.
[SPEAKER_06]: The decomposition will take place whether
it's covered with soil or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to volatilize.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, the real question is,
is the soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they remain stable?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no indication that Iroquois were
practicing shifting cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: No indication at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were in the same fields continuously.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were lots of indications that they
were burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did sometimes change fields,
but they were not rotating fields,
[SPEAKER_06]: cutting, burning, resting, and returning
to the same field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, you could argue that they had
plenty of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had no need to return to the same
field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there could be an argument that,
yes, they were cutting and burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to new fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the indication is no.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's very little evidence in the
historical documents that they were
[SPEAKER_06]: routinely opening new fields, particularly
because of soil depletion.
[SPEAKER_06]: No indication of that at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of indication of that in New England,
along the eastern seaboard, Virginia,
[SPEAKER_06]: North South Carolina, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of indication that that's what
farmers there were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they were really having problems
because they had these ultisols,
[SPEAKER_06]: or spodisols, or inceptisols that had much
lower amounts of soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some questions up in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgot you were there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jane, I was wondering, in the last couple
of decades, we've seen quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: attention to reduce tillage in this very
same region.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if you have any
observations on how that is being done,
[SPEAKER_07]: if it's being done in a way that increases
the odds of recovering the productivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that any attempts to
decrease tillage are going to be helpful
[SPEAKER_06]: for long-term productivity of soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it also means that you have to
look at how do you get that organic matter
[SPEAKER_06]: back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just that you stop tilling,
but that you begin to use other practices,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether they're cover crops, or animal
manure, things that will increase soil
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when I've spoken with Quirin
Kettering, about corn yields, she says
[SPEAKER_06]: that she can predict a corn yield based on
the soil organic matter content,
[SPEAKER_06]: almost, depending on where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that any time that they have soil
organic matter levels that are between
[SPEAKER_06]: three and four percent, it's very hard for
them to get a higher yield, regardless of
[SPEAKER_06]: how much inorganic fertilizers they add.
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly soil organic matter,
I think, is being increasingly recognized
[SPEAKER_06]: as the key to productivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in general, it's hard to increase soil
organic matter just by adding nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have other practices in place
that allow for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jane, do we have any information on
rainfall or rainfall patterns over that
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time that could have been,
besides the organic soil, organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there could be some other offsetting
that made plant growth more luxurious
[SPEAKER_00]: during that era?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and there's even some indications that
there were several periods in which
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures were quite a bit cooler,
which would actually cause quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: difficulty with corn growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some indications that in some years,
things did not go well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that yield declined because of climate
weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about precipitation, I don't have any
information at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the time in New York,
we don't suffer terribly from
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do get the occasional drought use.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would suspect that they would be
relatively similar with the ups and downs
[SPEAKER_06]: that we still see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would happen if you superimpose,
instead of continuous corn, the Three
[SPEAKER_04]: Sisters program on these soils?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it decrease the pressure on soil
organic matter and nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_06]: The results I showed you actually were
some were from corn monoculture,
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of those corn yields were from
Three Sisters, were from polycultures.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we found was that there was no
difference in corn yields, whether they
[SPEAKER_06]: were grown as monocultures or as Three
Sisters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my observation is that in terms of
nitrogen, the beans would provide almost
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing because they're being eaten.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some in the stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over a long-term year, they're kind of
adding to the pool that soil nitrogen pool
[SPEAKER_06]: is getting added to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the short term, not much.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quantity, it's hard to make any
estimates.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we found was that although corn
yields were not affected by whether they
[SPEAKER_06]: were grown as monocultures or
polycultures, that beans and pumpkin were
[SPEAKER_06]: greatly affected.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, you took a tremendous drop
in yields if you were, if you compared
[SPEAKER_06]: bean monoculture to being grown as part of
the Three Sisters.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also evidence that the Iroquois
grew beans by themselves and grew pumpkins
[SPEAKER_06]: by themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't always grow them mixed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were clearly, you know,
kind of deciding whether they needed to
[SPEAKER_06]: add to the stores of beans.
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably didn't plant them with corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they were looking maybe to trade or
something like that, they'd probably put
[SPEAKER_06]: in monocultures of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how much that might have impacted,
I mean, there's not a lot of crop residue
[SPEAKER_06]: from beans and not a whole lot from
pumpkin either or squash.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get fairly substantial amounts of
crop residue from corn, particularly good
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would think that the major effect
comes from corn and not from beans or
[SPEAKER_06]: pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen pictures, especially from
elementary school days, of black and white
[SPEAKER_03]: line drawings of presumably coastal Native
Americans showing settlers how to
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilize their corn by planting a fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is that revisionist history
completely bogus or what's that all about?
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be some combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a huge argument going out for
about 50 years about how true that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: My sense is that it may have been true for
coastal Indians.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were growing on spodosols and on
really poor nutrient status, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would have made sense for them to
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were also growing much smaller areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no indication of 100, 200 acre
fields of corn out in New England,
[SPEAKER_06]: right, at the time of contact.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Iroquois are growing on some of
the finest soils we have in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're not molosols.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're growing these huge acreages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, how in the world do you gather
up all these fish and throw them away to
[SPEAKER_06]: each mound?
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't seem realistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't match with kind of what we
know about those soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work to do for no response.
[SPEAKER_06]: You throw the fish in and nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: You still get the same great yield,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering how good an estimate of
the total area and cultivation at this
[SPEAKER_02]: time was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how good estimates do we have of the
total population to get some value?
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Likely to be quite small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the total population was probably
quite small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Populations were going up and down because
of disease, because of warfare.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Iroquois populations were probably
never much higher than 40,000 to 50,000
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we looked at what the areas
that, I mean, if you look at village sites
[SPEAKER_06]: and look at the areas of good land around
those village sites, if you go out to
[SPEAKER_06]: Genesee, in that area, if you look up at
Ganondagan, and you look at the highest
[SPEAKER_06]: yielding soils, it's way more than what
they could possibly have utilized,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do not have the types of land
pressure that were evident in other areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were not using nearly the land
that they had to the capacity that it
[SPEAKER_06]: could have been done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly a small population on good
soils and not being pushed to use the
[SPEAKER_06]: resource to its full extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of related to that, how large was the
community that might be associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 acres of corn?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywhere is from a couple of hundred to a
couple thousand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't know if that 200 acres of
corn was the only field that was had by a
[SPEAKER_06]: particular community or if they had a
couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally, Iroquoian villages tended
to be a couple of hundred up to as many as
[SPEAKER_06]: 2,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So up in Genesee, near Genesee,
Geneva, there's a Seneca community.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a community of about 1,720 that
may have been around 1,500 people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not huge areas, but then again,
not insignificant for not huge
[SPEAKER_06]: populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole lot more work that could
be done matching soils and populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're beginning to get some good estimates
on actual population numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a number of Iroquo studies
scholars who are working very diligently
[SPEAKER_06]: on that, actually two of them right here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very interested in population numbers
and how they're going up and down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to persuade them that it's
worthwhile to look at the soils and the
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural potential too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're mildly interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
