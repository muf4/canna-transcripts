[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to talk to
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've learned working in Apples is
that it draws a certain level of
[SPEAKER_00]: fanaticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be a good thing and that can
be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm probably an Apple fanatic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to pay attention to this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a postcard from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a nice artwork, but I'll show
you later what I mean by being a fanatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also an opportunity where an
artist came to see our Apple collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had seen the botany of desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: She fell in love with our apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she brought three artists from LA to
take pictures of our apples in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a muslin sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 20 by 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put it up in the middle of the
orchard in winter and it acts like a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: sail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only the PhD was behind the sail
trying to keep it in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went, wait a minute,
these guys are too smart to try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that from blowing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use nails to stick all the apples in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought when they made that postcard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably 30 by 40 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They place each apple in between the nails
rather than just stick it on a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can use the apples after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so another Apple fanatic that
resulted in a lot of the apples that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know today was Johnny Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Appleseed was a real person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went by the name of John Chapman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought it was morally bad to graft
apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about grafting a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you should only spread seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really savvy businessman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he collected seed from cideries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went all over the eastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gave out seed in exchange for people
listening to him about his religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died a very wealthy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Disney loved the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's more books on Johnny
Appleseed that you can even shake a stick
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was responsible by spreading these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because apples were not native to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had small crab apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the colonist apples weren't
adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: By spreading these seeds they intermated
and were selected for hardy material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became the evolution of apples
like Rome Beauty and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Nigel talked about the
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges is we can't even
agree on a scientific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: goes by Malice Domestica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe largely goes by Malice Pumala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people from Germany argue that it
should be Sylvesterous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so apple is an ancient allypolyploid
that behaves like a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also triploids, tetraploids,
apomix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gametophytic incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that ensures is that apple is out
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't plant one apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to plant two to allow for pollen
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I took plant breeding courses I
always heard about inbreeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: a trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in apple there's inbreeding
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't breed back and retain the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every cross I make are new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's clonally propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the origin of apple is in the
Kazakhstan China region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been of scientific interest to
get germplasm from the center of origin
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have genes of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of exploration by
Cornell scientists to go to these areas
[SPEAKER_00]: and collect apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their exploits were covered by Cornell
because I guess the native monkey
[SPEAKER_00]: populations figured if they collected the
apples the monkeys wanted to steal the
[SPEAKER_00]: bags of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had to beat off the hordes of
monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason that the Kazakh forests
became of interest is how many people here
[SPEAKER_00]: have read Michael Pollan's Botany of
Desire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if one more person calls us and says
I want to walk through the Kazakh forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was wonderful because it got people
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about the genetic diversity in
these seedling populations of Kazakh
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the people that read it seemed
to think that we had nothing else to do
[SPEAKER_00]: but take people through these forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversity is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope to show you today that the
diversity in our populations is equally
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive because apple is very
heterozygous and has a lot of genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: lend itself to diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of you have seen different apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the germplasm collection at the USDA
houses 2,000 to 3,000 different apple
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions, including those from the
origin of the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curator is Dr. Ganyuan Zhang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the curator is Thomas Chow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very active in expanding the
collection but also doing very valid
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping and genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at SNP markers and they're
also looking at genome-wide association
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about that collection is
I get to use it and don't have to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: its maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Nigel made me feel old because I
usually tell people don't tell when I
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated from college.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's past history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did go back to an apple genealogy
list that when I came and took over the
[SPEAKER_00]: job, this was the status in 1963 of the
apple genes that we knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even there, they weren't really all
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I hope to show you today is that
we've made remarkable progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sad part is about five of these
still remain not quite investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first linkage map was developed at
Cornell by a hybrid of the crabapple white
[SPEAKER_00]: angel by Rome Beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll show my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apple map was largely isozymes and
rapid markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coverage was pretty slim,
but we were thrilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next, in 2010, we have the apple
genome published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it comes from the efforts
of a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this really broke through things for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to have the genome
sequence of Golden Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is now available for us to look
at in terms of looking at markers or genes
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a member of the Rosebreed,
one of those large multi-state projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, there's three apple breeders
in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said, well, gee, for security
of our national food supply, should you
[SPEAKER_00]: all be in the room at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to Japan or China or other
places, there's tons of apple breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, there used to be probably an
apple breeder in every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kate is at Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jim Luby is in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a big Rose Breed Advisory
Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do is use the collections
that all of us have, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding populations, to come together and
share data on phenotyping and genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out very quickly that a lot of
our parents were not what they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeycrisp was a surprise, because not
only was the pollen parent what it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be, but the seed parent wasn't
what it was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to goof up the seed parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that we wanted to
emphasize quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the most important traits
for consumers are crispness and crunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: but texture, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, maintenance of this quality
through time is really essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And markers have been developed and are
being tested across populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you really fast facts on
the apple breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're at Cornell and on Ithaca,
you should know that we are one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of the largest in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've named 66 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we very much integrate genetics,
genomics, and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're multidisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We benefit very greatly from the expertise
found in Ithaca and Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell Cooperative Extension plays a
vital role in putting out a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: materials in grower trials, collecting
data, and getting the grower feedback on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make controlled hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do transgene technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, and especially within
two weeks, unlike last year where we got
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen out, we should have apple blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go for the apple blossom at this
popcorn stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want bees to visit the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we select one parent as a seed parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other parent we choose to get
pollen from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got briefed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband and I were dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was out in the field doing this
process, which is called emasculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you look tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, I've been emasculating
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you really shouldn't say that
in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's gotten used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still won't volunteer to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we remove the petals and the anthers
again so bees won't visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it guarantees that when you buy an
apple in the grocery store, the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: could be hybrids with crab apples or any
other variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make a cross, I'm controlling both
the mother and the father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every seed within that apple are
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why we don't say brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can plant thousands of these apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they maintain the genetic
characteristics of the mother combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with the father.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to produce better
varieties than what we currently have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the beauty of it is once I find
something that I like, so the seed seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on seedling roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it used to be it took forever,
8 to 12 years from planting a seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get fruit in the fourth leaf,
so four years after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, one of the selections that we
named was 12 years from making the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those of you that work with tomato
and Arabidopsis are saying 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it used to be 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel like we're rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a selection that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take a bud stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as many buds are on that stick,
I can make exact clones of that selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every Fuji apple derives back from
the original Fuji clone in Japan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Macintosh, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it on a root stock that's been bred
by Gennaro Fazio to dwarf the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it into production sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow that bud to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the top of the root stock is cut
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud becomes the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any time you see a tree in
somebody's yard or in an orchard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the joint union of the scion,
the fruiting part, and the root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I always love about science is I
love what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to work on stuff that I get to
eat all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gennaro Fazio loves what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he works with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very well known for Cortland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cortland was released in 1915.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an antique in two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to have a 100 year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a popular variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: McCowen in 1923.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come from Cornell or BTI,
you don't call it McCoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's McCowen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Named for a breeder in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Empire 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Ogold 1966.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have had John Ogold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really good apple, rated by a lot as a
top dessert variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it became more popular in Belgium than
it did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a good track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we were pleased about is we were
asked to give out apples at Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was competing giving out apples
against free champagne, wine, hors d
[SPEAKER_00]: 'oeuvres, oysters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, this is going to be a
long, long night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the staffers, whose favorite
apple in New York was Granny Smith,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does not ripen within our climate,
tried some of our apples and started
[SPEAKER_00]: yelling, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we knew we had some apples that
were going to be popular if we could get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough growers to try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our industry is a little complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 674 apple growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're second in the nation in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: A distant second from Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've had a program well before they
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macintosh is still our number one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting is, have some of
you heard about Sweet Tango?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a club variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeder in Minnesota made this
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person in Minnesota got rights to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody else was shut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people in New York state were able to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brothers on two farms next door,
one would have it and one wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we didn't want to do is come up
with an exclusive variety and shut out our
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I needed money for the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, can we do a plan where New
York growers will have exclusive rights to
[SPEAKER_00]: two of these new varieties and give the
industry an advantage and give us some
[SPEAKER_00]: needed income?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that because there were 674
growers, we had to have an organization
[SPEAKER_00]: that did not exist before.
[SPEAKER_00]: To move them forward, we needed the
growers to buy in and plant sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: volume to gain a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire, when it first came out,
somebody might grow five trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 trees, an acre of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the grocery store would say,
there's not enough volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're between a rock and a hard
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough volume,
you can't sell it to the grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grocery stores don't say, OK,
if you get enough volume, we'll buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew we needed to get the industry
to commit to planting enough to give
[SPEAKER_00]: 400,000 boxes so that there was enough
volume for marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also needed dollars for marketing
promotion because that sells a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a year or two ago, we formed the New
York Apple Growers, came up with the New
[SPEAKER_00]: York Apple Growers Limited Liability
Corporation, and we're equal partners in
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercialization of these two
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We share equally in risks and rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Royalties are split between the
corporation and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not myself, my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we started something where
normally we get a royalty per tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with these varieties, we get a royalty
per tree and a royalty per box of fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an apple breeder, to be able to say
that we've gotten a commitment to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 acres of these two varieties is pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be within over the next
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 60% will be something for New
York One and 40% will be New York Two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will not be their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names will be announced soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just needed to hold it with patenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's marketing plans underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in stores in 2014, but I think it
will be at Cornell Orchards this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reaction has been very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York One, Honeycrisp fans here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like Honeycrisp, you're going to
like New York One.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has Honeycrisp as one parent,
but is more attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Chris Watkins argue the
production challenges that we might have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would beg to say that we have a lot
less problems than the Honeycrisp parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got high sugar and has done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Two appeals to people that like a
little bit more sugar acid balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is very low browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice that these two varieties are
different and an appeal to different
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the beauty of having something like
this is not only was the industry behind
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but Chris Watkins, Jackie,
and Franny arranged opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to try these apples under
different storage regimes and not know
[SPEAKER_00]: what those storage regimes were and
comment on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of it is these guys all
have their own businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NIAC is on top of what they do to make
a living every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's an example of the
post-harvest assessment where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking what the quality was at different
times, hoping to draw what the best
[SPEAKER_00]: storage temperature would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the atmosphere at which it's
stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also got Deb Perozio and the
Dyson School to have students come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: names for these apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the students really got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a nice opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch a little bit because I
recognize that not very many of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go into apples as a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when you can work on Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll hope to bring in some ideas and
maybe have you think of apples in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if you come out of this and you
end up in a new position?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're working on a new crop or a crop
that you really are not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about that plant that you
will be investigating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to be preachy,
but we all learn that even when you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been in a position a long time,
it's surprising how much you can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: that isn't known or may not be in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding variation is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you find yourself researching
anything new, understanding the range of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that is available is crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of studies are done on
common cultivars, but there is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: range for whatever characteristic that
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly is how to phenotype
properly at the right stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing gene expression studies or
any study, getting the plants at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and minimizing the variation that's
inherent in every crop, but especially
[SPEAKER_00]: apples, is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all grants, there's a lot of money
for genotyping, but we're recognizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a phenotyping bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your markers and your genetic
discoveries are only as good on the
[SPEAKER_00]: material and the phenotyping that it's
based in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like computers garbage in,
garbage out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, this view is still very
much minimized or ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give an example, an apple that a lot
of researchers had not been aware of,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the visiting scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five, I say five, there's six,
usually five flowers per cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the dominant, the king
dominant apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is it's kind of a,
evolutionary perspective, the first apple
[SPEAKER_00]: is wonderful quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get frozen out, then those
laterals will still give you a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows apple to set under adverse
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're doing physiology
studies or gene expression studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're choosing the king flower,
that's the best fruit sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're choosing the laterals,
you're comparing a little bit apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not standardizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you either choose all laterals or thin
it down to a certain number or choose only
[SPEAKER_00]: kings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some varieties are very much king
dominant and others aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you remove the fruits to study,
you're stimulating ethylene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're studying ethylene response,
removing those fruits can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds kind of common sense,
but sometimes researchers have used fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: from a grocery store without an
understanding of the physiology of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect that you may not know if
you say, get me some apples or some
[SPEAKER_00]: kumquats to study, is the crop load.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a balance between vegetative and
reproductive fruit and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that balance isn't there,
it's gonna greatly affect the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a case where the fruit is very
much over set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have reduced level of quality
in those fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have differences in ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's understanding that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what differs between those
two fruits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is getting a lot of sunlight,
the other isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is probably more mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing that is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make a difference between the sun
and the non-sun side of the fruit in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemical composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to have good light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're dealing with seedling
populations, which I do, that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the sample size that's needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that kind of variation,
you'll see sometimes sample size of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how is that determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually there's good reasons and
there's a lot of great papers in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: sample size to have a valid, but that
needs to really be taken into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the general variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you choosing fruit that represents the
extent of the crop on the tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you choosing the best fruits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that's gonna influence the
results that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developmental stage is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've reached a long milestone in
understanding it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Janssen did some EST work where he
characterized from the flower stage to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit development what was happening with
cell division, cell elongation,
[SPEAKER_00]: starch, and ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recent paper by Schaeffer also looked at
changes depending on when you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you harvest it too early, your
volatiles are gonna be influenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: your ethylene is gonna be influenced,
skin color changes, acidity and starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the right stage is
crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm gonna switch a little bit more
because many of you have probably not seen
[SPEAKER_00]: an apple tree that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back from a visit to a researcher
and I started talking about this tree and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just kind of shook their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an apple that, this isn't a great
picture, should have used a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has usually fruits up and down like
Brussels sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a homeotic mutation, it's a
dominant gene, and it gives us a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively, we thought, simple system to
study a complex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that I wasn't the only one
that became enamored of it because we did
[SPEAKER_00]: the first QTL studies using the columnar
gene in 1997, I think, in apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now just in 2013, you can see physical
characterization, a really nice study of
[SPEAKER_00]: columnar hormones, and fine genetic
mapping this by our Geneva group,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Nan Bai, who's in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting about this,
this hormone work, we have a columnar
[SPEAKER_00]: apple and we have the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a genetic sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower discovered that one of the
branches had a lot of changed inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He propagated it, he found that it was
true to form, that it produced this
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced lateral branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use it in breeding,
about 50% of the seedlings can be
[SPEAKER_00]: columnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this hormone study, he compared the
columnar tree by a non-columnar,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-related apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a chance to look at something
that was genetically similar, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis was shifted a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is where sometimes as a
breeder you get to do fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columnar apple, dominant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeping apple, dominant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think happens when I cross the
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know, so we'll make the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps if you switch with the button
instead of the clicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got trees that were columnar on the
top, somewhat weeping on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got columnar, but you can see this
is what usually happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get trees that look like cigarro
cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have lateral branches, but they're all
very upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get weeping, and our physiologist said
you get trees that really don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen any that look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want apple trees to produce,
to have really straight branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings them into production sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got a little carried away
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example where you're having
good segregation of columnar and standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use weeping, you can get,
this is not a prune tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like spokes on a wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's an oxymutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're seeing variation that
you're not gonna read about until we get
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to publishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may offer chances to investigate
parts of your crop that were not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you that we use rootstocks to
dwarf trees, but what if you didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use rootstocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a seedling that is about four
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its sisters are 10 feet tall, and we have
some of these that fruit very early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: juvenile period.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two sister seedlings,
same age, same cross, one being dwarf,
[SPEAKER_00]: one being standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my PhD student who finished recently
and now is post-docing with the Leng Cheng
[SPEAKER_00]: used some of this unique material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a four-year-old seedling
fruiting, and its sisters are probably 20
[SPEAKER_00]: feet high, to look at GA content with
Peter Davies in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that people don't tell you
and I've been beating about is that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes in your studies, if you're doing
mapping populations or you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation, of traits, there may be
lethals that either the breeder or
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever's looking at the seedlings may not
realize exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pale green lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings come up, they die,
they don't have good chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: development, they die, and if you don't
see them soon enough, you just think you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a heterozygous, a lot of plants
are heterozygous for this trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are finding that it's linked to
certain alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these are three different
plant types in the same population,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these small ones tend to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the segregation distortion we
see, we think, are due to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lethal or sublethal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what columnar looks like in a
seedling population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the reduced internode length
as opposed to its standard colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a student that came in and he was
very interested in how hybrids coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make Y-crosses, which we can
do an apple, how can they coexist and how
[SPEAKER_00]: do they decide, like the case with weeping
versus columnar, which ones survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a columnar parent because we
argued that the columnar gene should be
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained and we could also follow it
phenotypically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used one of the parents of that hybrid,
as a control, because again, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: back-cross to the same parent,
and we used two different malice species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malice fosca is one of the native crab
apples, and malice demarii is from Taiwan
[SPEAKER_00]: area and is very low-chilling and not much
is known about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see, if we made this
cross, would we see columnar, would we
[SPEAKER_00]: not, and would we see certain lethalities
or genes being turned on or turned off?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ben Archesky is the student that's
looking at it, and he's gonna be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at methylation, activation of transposons,
and other attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A normal seedling was like the picture I
showed you, straight shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has world leaves and has a lot more
internodes in a slight area, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: columnar, but it's not your standard apple
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an apple tree that had 21
laterals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get laterals in seedling
populations, but in these interspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, we're getting laterals,
and we think we're gonna get really early
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing perhaps a columnar
manifestation, but dwarfed for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, and we're seeing very strange
multiple laterals, and so this material,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Richards is on, and Mike Scanlon are
on, Ben's dissertation committee,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they came out to the field,
and they said, Susan, we didn't think we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: say this, but you almost have too much
variation, which can be a good thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll make it challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, red skin color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red skin color should be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red was supposed to be dominant to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we developed a marker for red
color in apple, and to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think I would select out yellow
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good quality in both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a marker at Cornell in 1996,
but it didn't work for green, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been a lot more studies on apples,
so transgenic studies over expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, but the problem is you can have a
marker for red versus yellow, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have for color pattern, so striping
versus not, extent of the surface colored,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was determined in a study is that
when you have striped apples, the
[SPEAKER_00]: uncolored sectors are actually methylated,
so that's the color pattern difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of variation we see
for apple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one population, one apple from
each of different seedling trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yes, we could have selected for 50%
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the color variation, so we have
red, we have purple, we have orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we would have selected these
two, but this whole cross obviously has
[SPEAKER_00]: some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, one seedling from each,
and then this is a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute where we have expression of
color in the third layer of the epidermis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so usually you have color expression in
the first layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's color in the third
layer that's showing through and giving us
[SPEAKER_00]: this broad striping, and I'm gonna
condense a lot of it, because if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: is really interested in all the
intricacies of apple, I'd be glad to send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a PDF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show you that we really
are making a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like other crops, MIB transcription
factors are responsible for red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an ancient duplication of this
transcription factor, and it's responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for the red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some apples that you cut them in
half, and they look like beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so red inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being marketed for anthocyanin,
but a lot of them are really tannic and
[SPEAKER_00]: astringent, so if you see them at the
store, ask for a sample before you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and then we also are seeing
phenotypic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking some of these genes,
they're expressing them in apple or other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, and finding out what phenotypic
changes are occurring, and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really major.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty is some of those crosses that I
made with crab apples give me a byproduct,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's ornamental types, and so we
have some double flowered crabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have segregation this is a red
flowered, red petaled apple, and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nice that I get to study some of the
genetic aspects, but also have a secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making sure that those crab apples
are resistant to scab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scab is something that we get quite a bit
of time in the orchards of New York State,
[SPEAKER_00]: because scab likes rainy seasons in the
spring, and what do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainy seasons in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can screen seedlings at a young stage
that has this reaction, it's resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has this reaction, it's susceptible,
but the beauty is that if the leaf looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, the fruit of that tree is going
to have scab four years after when it
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits, so there's good correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot with apple scab
herbaldwinkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed markers, we looked at
interactions, we found new sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, we've looked at transgenic
approaches, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of the material that's scab resistant
today relies on one gene for resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we have to change that,
and we will be pyramiding genes for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, but it's only good if you have
scab resistance, if you have resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew or black crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the climate change, we're seeing new
diseases and disorders that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fire blight, which we now have a
antibiotic resistant strain in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to cause our growers some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I said it's important to know
variation, but it's also important to know
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are breeders in the crop that
you're working with or people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of time with the plant,
they might know of oddities that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand it, and so we keep a lot of
stuff which previous breeders would throw
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know citrus can flower and fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so can apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to get two crops
out of it, but interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, the parent of these two,
these are one fruit from each of
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire progeny look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my PhD in genetics so I could avoid
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the dice just fall where they
are, and we were getting genes for bad
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get not such variation,
but if all of them are russeted,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to help you any,
and this is an apple that every fruit is
[SPEAKER_00]: chimeric, so we see that the fruit color
is in sectors like Gala will do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every single fruit on that tree is
chimeric, which could be of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly there's five genes for fruit
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't win the lottery, but I can make a
cross and hit all five recessive genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seedling in this cross is small,
but we think that it's scab resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's certainly odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste good, and so a grower told me
that he could make a market with these,
[SPEAKER_00]: selling them as apple nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, brief glimpse at some Cornell
research, and I'm going to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: really brief because I'm running out of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know Chris Watkins was going to
be here, and I did say good things about
[SPEAKER_00]: him, so he's a valued colleague and
cooperator, as well as his cohort there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Nigel have done some really,
oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm talking to the slide and don't
have it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have done some innovative work at looking
at softening and also storage disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see an apple in the store,
it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got involved with
post-harvest, we put them in storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: we took them out, and it was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post-harvest guys are like,
wow, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these diseases and disorders,
and I'm crying because everything's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: LeLang Chang is known for his work in
sorbitol, also looking at metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as I said, he's looking at the sun
exposed and the shaded part, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important, and we're lucky to have these
type of people at Cornell at our access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canang Zhu is a tree fruit genomicist
stationed at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been looking with LeLang about some
of the malic acid genes, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating with someone, I believe,
at BTI with aluminum, and also looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruihai Liu and Sai Li are probably known
as the gurus of antioxidants, and have
[SPEAKER_00]: done work on the benefits of
phytochemicals, and also which compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: are most of interest, because some
compounds could be excreted and not
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial, and so it's helpful to have
them on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find sometimes interesting
anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is New York 674.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are its two parents, and we found
out in processing them, the equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: broke down, that these did not brown,
or browned a lot less than their
[SPEAKER_00]: counterparts, and so what this is helpful
for is studies of apple dippers or fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: cut slices, and so we have quite a
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a graduate student, Andrea Burke,
that found a lot of our advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: selections, are better than what's
currently out there, and could be put into
[SPEAKER_00]: apple dippers, and not have to be treated
with ascorbic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other Cornell researchers include Terence
Robinson, who works to convert apple
[SPEAKER_00]: orchards to really high density,
and Herb Waldwinkle, who has been key in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a lot of the transgenic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transgenic apples, you can be a proponent
or not, but we've learned a lot by using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add to our understanding about
mechanisms of ripening, or genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silenced plants have added to our role of
understanding ethylene, and reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: sorbitol, as Llang is looking at,
and PPO silencing, like the Arctic series,
[SPEAKER_00]: is of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the Arctic series,
which may be deregulated in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were not from our program,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: apple industry has decided that they're
not sufficiently in advance to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers to support the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support the technology, but don't
feel it's enough of a change to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have plenty of new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Orchards is gonna have a number of
them for you to try, and if you find
[SPEAKER_00]: something and like it, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like it, tell Nigel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanna thank current and former
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: My technician, Kevin Maloney, my Cornell
colleagues, funding from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different sources, and we're not breeding
apple trees without leaves, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: show that we can produce very productive
apples, and a colleague of mine saw these,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll be a Christmas card some year.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I gave you a nickel tour,
very fast-paced, of apple breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, which hopefully you came away
with a little bit better understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can go back to the lab and say,
thank God, I work on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It behaves like a diploid, but we actually
have, we don't have, but they've developed
[SPEAKER_00]: haploid apples, which we're very
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would simplify it even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a report by Telias.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the University of Minnesota,
and she looked at Honeycrisp, blushed
[SPEAKER_00]: versus striped apples, and said that the
non-anthocyanin portions were methylated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can give you that citation if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, and a nod to Chris, but it's
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to store well and having great
shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been criticized because we,
yes, we'll keep you at a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the apples that you're familiar
with, like Empire or Macintosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be, at harvest, can be 14 to 18
pounds, about, and can come out of storage
[SPEAKER_00]: very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some apples that are 22 to 25
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some, a lot of people like
Honeycrisp, which has good sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you like an apple, it tends to be 13
degrees Brix, and as the Brix increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tends to increase your liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have apples that have 16, 18,
20 degrees Brix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can say, oh my god, that would be
too sweet, but we also can take the malic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid from like .2 or .4 to 1.1,
and it's like eating shock tarts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I figure if we could get kids to eat
apples instead of those green apple
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially flavored candies,
so much the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, we have some apples that have a
hint of anise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either love them or you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, and then other
people think that they're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have a lot of different,
not your typical apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna try to get some stickers to
see if apples color when the sun hits
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and I was, the article where we did
the art, somehow got translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed the Japanese where they put a
sticker on, and it may mean good health,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fruit is considered a gift,
and it's very carefully reared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a news organization picked it up and
talked about tattooed apples, and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of like the most intricate
tattoos, but I figured we could do a big
[SPEAKER_00]: red apple, and who knows, just by putting
the sticker on, but of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that, and then a guy was like,
brides and grooms would love to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: date of their wedding and their names on
an apple, and it's like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't expect that any time soon at
Cornell Orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have markers, but as I showed you,
understanding the phenotypic base and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you're working on,
we need to test them across populations to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that they're not specific to the
germplasm in which they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been developed, so we have markers
for malic acid that we've run on our
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, but we're just verifying it,
so Canung Ju did that, and we also have
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're determining QTLs for different sugar
attributes, but we don't have markers for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the traits that are of greatest
interest because they're complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: like crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's spread all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have markers for allergens and
others, so we have a lot of markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, it's testing them across a wide
range of materials that's important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question, and I think it's
variety specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a great paper by Gutian who
looked at biennial bearing and looked at a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the variation, but it will depend
on all of those variables, but we do know
[SPEAKER_00]: that some apples are much less variable
than others, so there's a strong genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: component, but there's certainly a high
environmental component as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have qualitative genes for
resistance, but they do have very good
[SPEAKER_00]: field level resistance, so for example,
Honeycrisp, they've just discovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: has several genes for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York One, being a Honeycrisp hybrid,
might have such a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used it in crosses to get a bunch of
modifications, but we may have
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated a qualitative gene,
and then for things like powdery mildew

[SPEAKER_00]: need sprays, but they perform better than
