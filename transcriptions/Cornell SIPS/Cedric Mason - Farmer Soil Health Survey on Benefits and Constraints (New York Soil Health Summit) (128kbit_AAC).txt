[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad that Lynn Knight
presented a few of the details about the
[SPEAKER_00]: partial budget analysis, because I'm going
to follow up on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the survey was in part about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quick background story is that I
started working with Dave with the New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State Soil Health Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: last fall, and they've had this idea to
expand upon the idea of these case studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at a little bit of a broader
picture of the costs and the benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers were experiencing across the state
and try to capture many different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dave and I came up with this
questionnaire that we distributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: during the fall and the winter of last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, we collected 182 responses
covering almost all the counties in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we broke those down into, we asked
farmers to report the types of crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: they grew, some of the practices that they
used, especially focusing on covered
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, reduced tillage, and soil
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which included organic matter like manure,
compost, mulch, wood chips, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a pretty good representation
across the state, especially capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these more active agricultural
districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here in this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the more interesting
things right up front that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this was that we asked farmers to indicate
some of the major constraints that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were seeing on their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top three that rose to the top
here were poor drainage, soil compaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of these are really problems
that can be addressed with reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage, cover crops, and organic matter
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide is a simplified version of
the table that you might see on the
[SPEAKER_00]: handout that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did here is we asked farmers
to identify the benefits of reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage that they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, going back to Lynn's talk,
these could be increases in income or
[SPEAKER_00]: reductions in expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really came up here is for
reduced tillage, less labor was a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another aspect of this result here is
that we separated out farmers who were
[SPEAKER_00]: using reduced tillage on exclusively
vegetable crops and exclusively corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in looking at those
two groups and seeing if they were seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: different benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, there were a few differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next slide is a simple illustration
of those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the vegetables on the green
there, and the corn and soy is yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing that vegetable growers
reported that they're seeing greater
[SPEAKER_00]: yields from the reduced tillage practices
at a higher rate than the corn and soy
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, on the left there,
you can see the overall rate at which
[SPEAKER_00]: producers were reporting greater yields,
which is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's above 50% there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at the benefits of
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we separated out the corn and the
soy growers and the vegetable growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared those two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see that they're
experiencing different benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's really noticeable that the
erosion control benefit of the cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: is really noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 95% of corn and soy growers are
reporting that benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really number one for the cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple more illustrations here
of the differences between the two crop
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see that the vegetable growers
are the green there, and they're reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: almost an 80% rate in greater cash crop
yields when they're using their cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not releasing that benefit quite
as much in the corn and soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, corn and soy growers do see other
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see that they're sort of combining
cover crops with their livestock
[SPEAKER_00]: operations and using those cover crops as
animal forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a benefit they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the vegetable growers tend to
have less integration, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: with livestock, and so they're not seeing
those benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so David Montgomery especially just
talked about how farmers can use these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices to build their organic matter
over some amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important is trying to
figure out how long some of those changes
[SPEAKER_00]: might take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these farmers that completed the
survey, they told us basically how long
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd been doing these practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grouped them by their experience
level, one to five years, five to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw were some pretty
interesting patterns that emerged from
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide is showing a percentage of each
group that practices reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of each group reporting
less erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here pretty clearly as time
goes on, on your x-axis there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're approaching 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the percent of farmers reporting less
erosion is almost at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if we start down here and we look
at the one to five year group here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're only at about 65% there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two things maybe to note here is that
you do see some benefits right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the likelihood that you're gonna see
those benefits increase over time is
[SPEAKER_00]: evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the chi-squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test there to show that that's a
significant association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a really interesting result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily related to soil health,
but we're seeing that more experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers who've been doing reduced tillage
longer, they're taking better advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: these cost share programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be a way to an area of
improvement in terms of policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe outreach, trying to get some of
these farmers who are getting started,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get them enrolled in some of
these programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we're seeing often yields at
about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once these farmers have been using
cover crops for 10 years, the percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that report greater yields is
really jumping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a little bit of an
indication that it takes time for these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices to fully benefit the farmer and
the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we looked at the ability of
these different practices to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience to extreme weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the future climate is unknown,
but it's anticipated that severe rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: may become more frequent and also
throughout as a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both cover crops and reduced tillage
can improve your soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can theoretically improve your
resilience to some of these extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to test this hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is the results of 182
farmers using these practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing basically the best
performances from cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there could be some wiggle room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the takeaway here is that both
cover crops and reduced tillage are
[SPEAKER_00]: providing resilience to help farmers make
it through droughts, helping them create
[SPEAKER_00]: soils that retain their water better,
and also helping prevent erosion that
[SPEAKER_01]: might happen when they experience a heavy
rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I could take a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'd like to also add that
there is this handout in the packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to be writing up and
publishing some future papers and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say that that's a real
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these bars are going to have a certain
degree of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that's exactly what the rate
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of wiggle room
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing to look at is the
chi-square p-value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's showing that there is an
association between the length of time
[SPEAKER_00]: that the farmer has been doing the
practice and the likelihood that they
[SPEAKER_00]: responded that they were getting greater
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I mean, this is also a very
complicated system that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be other things that come
into play there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really say for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that there's a pattern
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, yeah, I mean, there's
definitely some other things going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we also found that there was a little
bit of a tendency for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that have been doing the practices
longer or growing certain crops and not
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really get to the bottom of this,
I think we'd have to do some kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: involved modeling that would really tease
out how all these factors affect yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically how long have you been
using this practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe older farmers used slightly
different practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was about the perception of the
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't explicitly ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine it would be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really discriminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was farms of all sizes,
all crop types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I suggest you look for one of
the publications or my contact information
[SPEAKER_00]: is on there if you want to get in touch
with us and we can send you some more
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, one interesting thing that I
just remembered was that there was one
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer who wrote in a response that
basically indicated that the rent that
[SPEAKER_00]: they paid to the landowner somehow went
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they negotiated or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was an interesting thing that
somebody just wrote in.
