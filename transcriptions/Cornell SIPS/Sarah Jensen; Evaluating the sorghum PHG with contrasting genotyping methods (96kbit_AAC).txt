[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start out and remind you
about what I talked about last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was also the practical haplotype
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so last year, I talked a lot about
building the practical haplotype graph in
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum and how we were trying to use it
in a breeding program, which is run by
[SPEAKER_00]: Gael Presois and based in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've used the practical haplotype
graph in that program for genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection a couple times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last year, really, one of the
things that we've done is we've tested the
[SPEAKER_00]: practical haplotype graph with different
genotyping methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today, actually, what I wanted to
talk about is how we've tested the PHG and
[SPEAKER_00]: share some of those genotyping methods and
the results with and without the practical
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotype graph.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start out, we have our nice genomic
selection scheme on the right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in any GS scheme, we have this point
where we need to genotype the progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of options for
genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this list on the left is absolutely
not an exhaustive list, but it does list
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the possibilities that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what we want is a technology
that's going to be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also really want a technology
that's fairly easy to use both across
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs and also across species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we start to subset down this
list based on those criteria, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually cross out a lot of the things
that are on this list to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two of the ones that are left are
RHAMP-seq or RAMP-seq and SCIM sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are two genotyping methods
that I have used with the practical
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotype graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I'm going to be
presenting for you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, last year, I put up a slide and I
said, okay, the practical haplotype graph
[SPEAKER_00]: is really designed to be an imputation
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been designed to work with a
lot of different types of sequence data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used GBS as an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put up GBS data and I showed,
okay, we can use GBS for genomic selection
[SPEAKER_00]: in Guyel's breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also use that same sequence
data with the practical haplotype graph in
[SPEAKER_00]: Guyel's breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, I'm not going to show you
GBS data with the practical haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, but I am going to use that GBS data
as our baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that GBS is a really an effective
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're always trying to get
prediction accuracies with new
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies that are at least equivalent
to that, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start actually by talking about
SCIM sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about SCIM sequence,
what I'm really talking about is a
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol that was designed by Nextera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, they take a TN5
transposase that jumps into the genome at
[SPEAKER_00]: different positions randomly across the
entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sequence out from those
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that gives us a very sparse initial
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also completely random.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not capturing one specific or
consistent marker set with this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs less than $10 per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a viable option or something
that we'd like to be able to use with a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question at the bottom then
becomes, does imputation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: practical haplotype graph make it possible
to use this technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put up this slide first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plot very similar to one I
showed you last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both in this plot and in plots for the
rest of my talk, if the box is blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's GBS data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the baseline, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: GBS works well for prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really comes down to the fact
that because this is based on random
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, there's no consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no overlap in positions that we're
actually sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where the practical
haplotype graph can come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take that sequence data and we run
it through the PHG to impute missing
[SPEAKER_00]: information, we actually get these dark
green boxes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that the practical
haplotype graph is actually helping us to
[SPEAKER_00]: restore that prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get an equivalent prediction
accuracy, approximately the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: markers as we would have with GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do it at half the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the answer to the question then is
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With SCIM sequencing, we can use the
practical haplotype graph for effective
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second technology is RAMP-seq or
RHAMP-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amplicon based sequencing
method and it targets specific regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does give you fewer markers,
but it's offered as a service by a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means it's very little work for
breeders to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we like it for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so RAMP-seq, when we put up a plot
like this, you see that using RAMP-seq
[SPEAKER_00]: positions or amplicons on their own
actually works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already about the same level as GBS
with this light purple, those light purple
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to point out that this is
targeting about 2,000 loci across the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been designed specifically for
sorghum, but not specifically for Guyel's
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we take that sequence data and
we run it through the practical haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, we get these dark purple boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't look so good because you
can see we're not improving our prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy, we're actually really decreasing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that tells us two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is that in Guyel's program,
the 2,000 markers that we're capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: with RHAMP-seq is enough to do effective
genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is it's telling us
that with this technology right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the practical haplotype graph is probably
just adding random noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that actually the
programmers have changed actually how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're imputing these genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the next couple of months,
I'll be looking at if those changes have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually improved this kind of plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the answer right now is that no,
with RAMP-seq, the practical haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: graph doesn't really help us and isn't
really necessary at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us to this nice point where
we have a couple different options for
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the option that a breeder chooses
really should be designed or should be
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen based on both their breeding goals
and the budget that they're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to build this plot a little
bit up on the right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis, we have the number of SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only goes to 3,000, but you can imagine
we could extend that fairly significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the y-axis, we have cost per
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be plotting data that comes from
AgriPlex Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the companies that produces
this RHAMP-seq amplicon-based sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I plot those, I've also colored,
hopefully you can see it, OK, the
[SPEAKER_00]: background of this plot to show you at
that location in the graph, what is our
[SPEAKER_00]: best sequencing option cost-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just as an example, if we had a
point where this x is on the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means we want more than 2,000 markers
and we're willing to pay more than $15 per
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so GBS is a good genotyping strategy
in that particular case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's add some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start adding data, we can see that
if we're working in a species that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of breeding efforts going on,
maybe we expect that across all breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, there could be 80,000 or even
100,000 individuals that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're following the blue and purple
lines on this plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, RHAMP-seq is going to be our
best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get about 2,000 markers from
RHAMP-seq, and we're still under that $10
[SPEAKER_00]: per sample goal that we'd like to be
hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're working in a species that has
more moderate breeding efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we have 10,000 or 25,000 samples
that we expect to be genotyped,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're following the orange and green
lines on this plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can really decide between RHAMP-seq
and skim sequencing with the practical
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotype graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both will give us a cost-effective option
for genotyping, and we really want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention then to how many markers
we need, because the cost for 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: markers is fairly equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last, if we're working in a small
breeding program, we're following the red
[SPEAKER_00]: line here, and skim sequence with the
practical haplotype graph is really going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the most effective option for us in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to point out that the data
from AgriPlex only goes up to 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: markers, but I sort of tried to
extrapolate out from that, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: the dotted lines on this plot are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you extrapolate out,
if you need more than 2,000 markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: either for your breeding program or
because you want to be doing other genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: analyses, then something like GBS or skim
sequencing with the practical haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: graph is going to be a really good option
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets us back to our original
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is the practical haplotype graph most
useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is, one, if we're working
in a species that has fairly small
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding efforts, the PHG can help get us
cost-effective genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is that if we're working in medium
or large breeding programs, but we want
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 1,000 or 2,000 markers,
the PHG can also help fill in some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: marker information that we might want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third is, if we're working in
a breeding program or set of programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want to have a consistent set of
SNPs, the practical haplotype graph can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually output a consistent SNP set,
and so that can help with that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency as well if we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am about out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, I've convinced you that the PHG
does have its uses, and we have used it
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively in Gael's breeding program,
although I don't have time to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that have worked
on this, and so I do want to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the Buckler Lab, everybody in
Gael's program at SHIBAS, and then Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Morris and Kabete Muleta at the Morris
Lab, who have also put a lot of time into
[SPEAKER_00]: this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have questions,
I'd be happy to try and answer those now,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we can talk afterward as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, all of the box plots
I showed, are the taxa being shown here
[SPEAKER_00]: the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually all data from the
training population that Gael made,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's about 250 taxa in that data
set, and it's consistent across all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
