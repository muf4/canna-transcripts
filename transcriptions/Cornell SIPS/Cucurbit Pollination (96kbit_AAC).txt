[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell and I am
with Steve Reiners, a horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: professor and statewide vegetable
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we'll talk about pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve, we've talked about pollination
in watermelon and what that can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but are there other effects of like
pollination in other cucurbit crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: how that affect the fruit of the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cucumber and you can see in this
hand I've got a cucumber very normally
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you'd want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could grow maybe a couple more days before
we would typically harvest it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it would be fine right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the same plant and this one
is very crooked as compared to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is that is a
pollination issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bees did get over, move some pollen
from the male flower to the female flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was probably enough to just get
the fruit set and for it to start to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we didn't have nice uniform ity with
that, with the pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's parts of it that weren't sort
of fertilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's leading to, so if we cut
this open later on when the seeds develop,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we'd see is in the normal parts,
the seeds would be normal and large and in
[SPEAKER_01]: here there probably wouldn't be any seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for a home gardener, these are fine to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste would be just like a cucumber,
but if you're a commercial grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have a really hard time trying to
grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this pollination issue that we see,
another very common question we get from
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners is they often will, they've read
somewhere that again, with the bees out in
[SPEAKER_01]: a cucurbit field, they can move the pollen
from one plant to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when they move that pollen
from a cucumber to a melon or from a melon
[SPEAKER_01]: to a squash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that cross and then they might see
something in their garden this year that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks odd and they think it was because of
the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, if in cucurbits within pumpkin,
and squash, and winter squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: there can be some cross pollination that
can occur, but it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll repeat that again, it's impossible
for a cucumber to cross with a melon or a
[SPEAKER_01]: melon to cross with a squash or for a
pumpkin to cross with a watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just cannot happen in nature at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually when you do see maybe a
zucchini that crosses with a pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't see that change that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will only be if you save the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where this can happen sometimes is
people are cleaning out their gardens in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall and they'll throw their old
rotting squash and things like that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost pile and then they get a volunteer
plant the following year and it flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: and it produces a fruit that looks a
little bit like a squash or pumpkin might
[SPEAKER_01]: look a little bit like a zucchini.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we call them squampkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it was from the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not see the effects of that cross
that first year when it happens because
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're seeing here, what the outside
of this is all maternal tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be whatever you planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds is where the genetics have
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see that in something you've
planted this year and you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, but I planted the seed and I know it
was a cucumber and it's come out weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible that there was a little mix
up at the seed company or maybe a mix up
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were planting it themselves and
you put the wrong seed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you won't see that unless you
hold on to those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds for a year and plant them out the
following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven, just to conclude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I see bees in my field,
that doesn't mean that all the flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get like pollinated, completely
pollinated to get a good fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it actually takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've done some work at
watermelons where they think it might take
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from 10 to 15 bee visits to move
enough pollen over to that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you think, well,
there's bees there, you might even bring
[SPEAKER_01]: bees out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers will bring bees out into
their fields, but they might go to other
[SPEAKER_01]: places where they prefer the pollen
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so just because you see the bees,
you want to see the bees, but there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee that they're as active as they
should in your cucurbit field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just learned about pollination,
how the fruit can be misshapen and also
[SPEAKER_00]: some advice on like how to check when you
have a cross, but you know that you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: have it in the first season if you have
your crop in the field.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
