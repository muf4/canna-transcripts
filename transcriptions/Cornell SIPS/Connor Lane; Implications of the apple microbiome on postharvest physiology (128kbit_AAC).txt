[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and with that, what I'm
actually going to be talking to you about
[SPEAKER_02]: today is about the post-harvest apple
microbiome and summarizing the work I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing for the last five years at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so just to introduce, one of the
things that I think we can sometimes take
[SPEAKER_02]: for granted, and I certainly took for
granted before starting this program at
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell, is how we can just walk into a
grocery store and see all this amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh produce months after harvest,
in the case of something like apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: That right now, apples have been harvested
mostly in like September with a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of like August and October, but you can
walk into a grocery store now and see New
[SPEAKER_02]: York apples that were harvested from that
previous season were right in the grocery
[SPEAKER_02]: store and they look and taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we actually make that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and the answer is with a variety of
post-harvest technologies and the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to approach this in science is by
looking at, okay, what are the issues and
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we solve them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this big issue with fresh
produce where a large percentage that in
[SPEAKER_02]: some cases, this is like low-balling it,
24% of fruits and vegetables are lost
[SPEAKER_02]: before reaching consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big issue, and again, as I mentioned as
scientists, we like to think about why
[SPEAKER_02]: does this happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are a lot of different ways
that food can go bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are sort of, what do you think of
as like food naturally going bad through
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an essence, which is based on
cellular respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fruit has metabolism, it goes through
all of its energy, and then it starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then water loss is also a big deal,
especially in a lot of leafy greens that
[SPEAKER_02]: even with a little bit of water loss,
they'll shrivel up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have molds and rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in these, in horticulture,
we call these post-harvest pathogens that
[SPEAKER_02]: will infect the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, these are very dangerous
because they'll spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have physiological
disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: A common example is something as simple as
apple browning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bite into an apple and it's kind of
brown and gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not moldy, like it's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not what you really want from an
apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have all these issues that we
have to deal with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the main things that we want
to do to preserve the shelf life is to
[SPEAKER_02]: slow respiration, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that slows the ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an essence process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most effective thing we do for a lot
of these problems is refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I learned taking
post-harvest classes with Chris and Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sushant Dhan is doing our research is how
important refrigeration is, like
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerate, refrigerate, refrigerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are some other more
specific technologies we can also use that
[SPEAKER_02]: if you reduce the oxygen, plants need
oxygen to process a further cellular
[SPEAKER_02]: respiration to process energy like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that can limit respiration as
long as it doesn't get too low and you get
[SPEAKER_02]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also this plant hormone,
ethylene, that mediates a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an essence that we can control,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So apples are what is known as a
climacteric fruit that through
[SPEAKER_02]: developments, through this ripening phase,
you see that there's this big burst of
[SPEAKER_02]: ethylene and then shortly after you get
this big burst of respiration,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which leads to a lot of ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an essence, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a fruit like strawberry,
which the graph gives here for comparison,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't see that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some fruit do have this climacteric,
some don't, apples do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that if we have this,
showing this chemical pathway for
[SPEAKER_02]: ethylene, if we're able to inhibit it at
certain points, these two compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-MCP and AVG, are ones that the Watkins
lab very commonly uses and that are very
[SPEAKER_02]: commonly used in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can inhibit ethylene,
we can preserve the shelf life,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other issue, one of the other
issues I mentioned is water loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do we prevent that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big way is when we refrigerate in big
storage rooms and we try to keep it very
[SPEAKER_02]: humid for the produce that 95% relative
humidity is the common benchmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, there's a problem with
humid conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone's a plant pathologist seeing
the water all over these apples,
[SPEAKER_02]: this might be a cause for a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you get a lot of moisture on
apples, that's just, or on anything as you
[SPEAKER_02]: might expect, that's just inviting rots
and molds in, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something gets super wet, mold will
grow on it and we don't want that on our
[SPEAKER_02]: food, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so balancing all of these approaches
is tricky and we can control most of these
[SPEAKER_02]: posthumous pathogens with fungicides,
which have some regulatory concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you don't care about that,
the one thing that really struck me is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's becoming more and more difficult
to develop new fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already found all the easy modes of
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really struggling to find new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need new approaches in addition to the
fungicides we already use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one that's being investigated is
biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which the principle of it is to use,
to simplify, to use the good microbes to
[SPEAKER_02]: fight off the bad microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you have a good bacteria or a yeast
that will fight off the bad posthumous
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens and protect the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are some commercial products
available for these, but they're less
[SPEAKER_02]: common than conventional fungicides for a
couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they're a bit more expensive and they
can work as well, but they're a bit more,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to have the right context for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not quite as consistent,
can apply to every situation, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of the people who look at
biocontrol when this microbiome concept
[SPEAKER_02]: started were really interested because
they had the idea that instead of just
[SPEAKER_02]: using this biocontrol antagonist to attack
the pathogen, that there can be all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these interactions with the microbes that
just happen to be on the fruit surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that leads to developing theories
of how can we actually use the microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: for biocontrol?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was where a lot of the kind of
early theory, early I say, as in like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, because this field is very new,
theory around the fruit microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground microbiome comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that people have
taken from other microbiome studies is
[SPEAKER_02]: this idea of the holobiont theory,
which originated from the idea of the
[SPEAKER_02]: human microbiome, which, and to be clear,
this is not the only way people view the
[SPEAKER_02]: human microbiome, but it's one framework
people use is that we as humans are a sum
[SPEAKER_02]: of not just our own physiology and not
just our own actions, but of constant
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions between us and the microbes
in and on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything we do is not just human
physiology, it's human physiology
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with microbial physiology and
microbial ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people have said, why don't we
apply that to fruits as well, that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are all these microbes living in and on
fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have got to be these constant
interactions there that can shape all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can just study these
microbiomes, maybe we can then figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: more about the fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that leads into my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this post-harvest physiology
element of trying to make sure that fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: lasts longer, deal with the issues that
arise, and combining that with my
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial ecology of we know that there
are these microbes on surface of fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we use those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I've essentially been
working on for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple of years ago,
I gave a presentation for the work I did
[SPEAKER_02]: for my masters, which is AVG.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder, this is one of the
chemicals that inhibits ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you need to know is that it slows
down ripening, it slows down senescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was associated with bacterial but
not fungal microbiome variation in gala
[SPEAKER_02]: apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we hypothesized that, OK,
if we manipulate fruit maturity with this
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical, that should change what microbes
we find out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that it was true for
bacteria, though we didn't find evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: for fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things about apples,
I mentioned the climacturic, is that gala
[SPEAKER_02]: apples don't have a very strong,
don't have a very pronounced climacturic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And its ethylene goes up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with this new variety, snapdragon,
which great apples if you live in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast US, by the way, highly
recommend, that those have a much more
[SPEAKER_02]: pronounced climacturic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked, can we see effects with this
other cultivar?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with that, we also wanted to
expand
[SPEAKER_02]: the experimental design to look at harvest
time as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That here, again, we have this very
simplified pathway where AVG chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: stops ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because ethylene leads to ripening of
senescence, you can use AVG to create
[SPEAKER_02]: apples that will last longer through
storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also looking at manipulating
maturity just through harvest times that
[SPEAKER_02]: we harvested very early, earlier than you
would typically harvest apples and also
[SPEAKER_02]: later than you would typically harvest
apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what were our hypotheses?
[SPEAKER_02]: We predicted that this AVG, this ethylene
inhibitor, would affect microbiome due to
[SPEAKER_02]: ethylene mediating some microbial
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ethylene, we're mostly concerned with
it because of its effect on ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also is known to have some effects on
plant defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we predict that
harvest time will influence the microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: due to some ecological principles,
community succession and turnover,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the longer the apples are there,
the more time the microbes have to
[SPEAKER_02]: colonize and that will change the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also stored the apples and
predicted that would actually have the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiomes due to this different
environment that they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sampling procedure, I'm not gonna
go through this for every experiment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but essentially we had a few different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had our chemical application that
we had as ethylene inhibitor AVG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had two harvest times that were three
weeks apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, like earlier and later than you
would typically harvest apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three storage times with a lot of
replication to get a lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the process of actually sampling
the microbiome is kind of entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, when I explained it,
it's you put these apples in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a machine to shake some around a
lot with this solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you filter all the liquid through
onto this filter paper and get this grime,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has all the microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can store it at the bottom of
this tube and then do typical DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions and sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm not gonna go through this
for every experiment, but we have our DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at this point, you ship the
samples off to a company who does the
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way microbiome sequencing is
typically done is with these small
[SPEAKER_02]: amplicons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sequencing entire big genomes of
microbes is pretty expensive, but we can
[SPEAKER_02]: sequence a small region of a ribosomal
subunit to tell what's what essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can do a bunch of
bioinformatics, process the sequence to
[SPEAKER_02]: get these feature table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a sample and then these are all
different microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get relative counts of each to see
how much of each microbe is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of high level explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here, first I'm gonna show the
ethylene data and looks about what we
[SPEAKER_02]: expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That when we apply AVG, we see that the
ethylene is greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the early harvest apples continue
to get ethylene after stores, where when
[SPEAKER_02]: we harvest them late when they already
kind of hit, especially for the control
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, they've hit that point of the
climate track, the ethylene production
[SPEAKER_02]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going into the actual microbiome
data, I like to give an overview
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation of these ordinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I each time do these presentations,
because I know that interpreting these
[SPEAKER_02]: multivariate data isn't something that
everyone always does their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially for these, each point is a
microbiome, which for these sample is four
[SPEAKER_02]: apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the points that are further apart have
more different microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the points are similar together,
have more similar microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The points that are further apart have
different microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we find hundreds of different
microbes, we're not able to make these
[SPEAKER_02]: generalizations about what's a good
microbiome or a bad microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we can say is that when we take all
these hundreds of microbes together to
[SPEAKER_02]: form the microbiomes, these ones tend to
look more similar to each other and these
[SPEAKER_02]: ones look different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the main thing we see is that the
darker points that represent the later
[SPEAKER_02]: storage time tend to cluster differently
from the lighter points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we see that the late harvested
ones, these blue ones also cluster a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: differently from the early harvest points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can also do some statistics on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And partially because it's summarizing
like PhD work as part of the fence,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna have to get a little nitty
gritty into the stats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also like important for the story
of why I did what, but I'll try to not go
[SPEAKER_02]: like too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing we were really curious
about was how do we know that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: AVG?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did find the, these initial ones
are P values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did find a significant P value
that were, the chance of seeing these
[SPEAKER_02]: differences is pretty low due to random
chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably a treatment effect,
but you'll notice the R squared for all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these is pretty low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only in bacteria, only 3% of the
variation is explained by this ethylene
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibitor application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people who work on univariate data
are probably thinking 3% is like nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: for an R squared.
[SPEAKER_02]: That like, how do you even get a
significant result?
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the answer is multivariate data
is very complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That 3% of the microbiome, of differences
in the microbiome across hundreds or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: even thousands of different microbes,
if we see it consistently enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can give us a significant result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does look like, yeah, it's doing
something, but the actual variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's explaining isn't the largest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that kind of kept
me thinking for a while afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see pretty similar things for fungi
that harvest time, storage time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this chemical application,
this ethylene inhibitor significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: shifted the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here the R squared is 0.04.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's explaining 4% of the variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to find some cool results
with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite one was, doing this stats
analysis to look at the direction of the
[SPEAKER_02]: shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that all the red ones are
factors that significantly predict
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we see is when we apply AVG,
the microbiome shifts the opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: direction as late harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same direction as we would expect
from early harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little complicated to work
my head through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it took me a while to think about
this, but what that essentially means is
[SPEAKER_02]: that when the fruit is less mature,
either due to having AVG application or
[SPEAKER_02]: due to being early harvested and going in
this direction, that shifts the microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: in a similar direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the microbiome is really tied to this
physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you're able to manipulate the
maturity by either harvesting early or by
[SPEAKER_02]: using a chemical to reduce ethylene
production, that shifts the microbiome in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a cool result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got a good paper out of it with the
last thing we did with this study being
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at shotgun metagenomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned that when we do sequencing
for microbiomes, we tend to just look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: small region of the genome to tell what's
what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't actually tell us what the
genes are that these microbiomes have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did was the shotgun
metagenomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sequencing, which does sequence at
random the entire microbiome, which we can
[SPEAKER_02]: use to predict what genes are there and
see what these microbes are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did find some interesting results
that I wish I had time to dig into,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are already a lot of data here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main thing is in large part due to
the fact that we weren't able to sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: as many samples, because the sequencing is
much more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at the overall function
differences from the predicted genes,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of these are bacterial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see some differences due to storage
time looking from at harvest to six
[SPEAKER_02]: months, combining some other data sets
that I also don't have time to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But harvest time and AVG application don't
result in significant differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, we found that according to
our hypothesis, this AVG chemical does
[SPEAKER_02]: have an effect on the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's similar to harvesting early,
because both could create less mature
[SPEAKER_02]: apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the actual R squared value,
the amount of variation explained by this
[SPEAKER_02]: AVG, is not super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that storage time is really the
important factor of bacterial composition
[SPEAKER_02]: and function, which is something we know
from the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of studies have looked at this,
and a lot of studies have found the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, that storage time is very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that got me thinking of we got a great
paper out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my advisor Chris asked a very
good question and talked to me about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that for a PhD, you don't want to
just think about doing these separate
[SPEAKER_02]: studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to think about, well,
how do I build off of these previous
[SPEAKER_02]: results?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked at this of what we were
doing with maturity, and it's a very cool
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that we're able to manipulate
maturity and shift the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was looking at the R squared values,
the effect values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I think we just got to try
something different to see if we can find
[SPEAKER_02]: a bigger effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the next thing I looked at were
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely the things that target the actual
fungi, maybe we'll see really big effects
[SPEAKER_02]: with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, we're looking at
fungicides and this skull inhibitor,
[SPEAKER_02]: this different chemical that I'll be
talking about as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting with the fungicides,
we have these two different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fludioxanil, which is a
conventional fungicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what you think of where you
spray fungicide post-harvest on these
[SPEAKER_02]: apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fludioxanil is a very common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matamycin is a natural product compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's less commercially used,
but it's available for organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the main difference, the reason
experimentally we think that this would be
[SPEAKER_02]: different is that fludioxanil is
specifically designed to target pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas matamycin is more broadly toxic to
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we expect potentially differences from
there, from how the microbiome reacts to
[SPEAKER_02]: those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another factor here is we have
this skull inhibitor that we're testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So superficial skull, you can see these
kind of pictures of these apples that you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wouldn't want to eat,
that is caused by a variety of abiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't a rot or a mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just the apple doesn't have
everything it needs and it's developing
[SPEAKER_02]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have this antioxidant DPA that's
used to treat superficial skull because a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of what creates these physiologically
are oxidation reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some regulatory concerns around
DPA where it's banned in Europe because
[SPEAKER_02]: its effect is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an antioxidant, so we're thinking,
okay, like does that ship the microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: if we really change the surface
environment with this antioxidant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as previously we wanted a post-harvest
component.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time we decided to look more at
short-term because we looked at long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like just 28 days and then a room
temperature shelf life afterwards to
[SPEAKER_02]: address if the fungicides really hit the
microbiome, does it recover quickly?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we hypothesized that when we target
pathogens with these fungicides that it
[SPEAKER_02]: will kind of disrupt the entire community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then similar methods, I'm not going to
go over everything before of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing we used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we looked at the fungal data,
we find that the main factor that shapes
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal communities is the DPA,
the skull inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see these 95% confidence ellipses
that are overlapping, but they're clearly
[SPEAKER_02]: not identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in the exact same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that it is a highly significant
result and that the R squared is 0.15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 15% of the variation of what we see of
the fungi on the apple surface can be
[SPEAKER_02]: explained by adding this antioxidant skull
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fungicide we found was barely
significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we did pairwise, we found that
natamycin, the organic broadly toxic to
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, fungicide had a small effect
that was barely significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the conventional fungicide that
specifically targeted pathogens had no
[SPEAKER_02]: observable effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we looked at bacteria,
all of our treatments, we didn't find any
[SPEAKER_02]: significant results.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did find is the storage time
heavily impacted the microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: where between the 14 and 28 days,
there was a big shift, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we took it out of actuarium
temperature, it shifted back, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an interesting result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't really exactly what we were looking
to test without the fungicide being
[SPEAKER_02]: significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was pretty happy with this,
that we see that there are these shifts
[SPEAKER_02]: that occur to cold storage, which we
already know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we didn't know is that at least
in the short term, they're somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: reversible, that we see this big shift in
14 and 28 days, and that it goes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: looking like how it did in early storage
if you take it out at room temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: which could imply that the cold storage
room environment really is a factor that,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, is reversible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I decided to dig into,
we found that the DPA, the applications of
[SPEAKER_02]: the antioxidant skull inhibitor,
had a big effect on the fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what fungi is this actually affecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we found a few different ones that
were significantly affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible that it's affecting more,
but when you test hundreds of fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to do a pretty strict multiple
testing correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're only seeing the ones that are
very significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you test hundreds of things
with just a P, 0.05 caught up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna get a lot that happened to
come across as significant, even if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just due to random chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using a lot more stringent cutoff
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main thing is that this
Aureobacidium genus is very common on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface of apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a yeast that's known to have certain
biocontrol properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing that I was able to find
in the literature, which kind of tied this
[SPEAKER_02]: together, is that part of its biocontrol
action is through exerting oxidative
[SPEAKER_02]: stress on pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by spraying the antioxidant,
it's not able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that explains why it's a lower
abundance when you add the DPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not able to actually enact that
biocontrol as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in conclusion, let's see, I'm still
doing okay on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have fungal composition,
as I mentioned, was associated with this
[SPEAKER_02]: skull inhibitor antioxidant DPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then bacterial composition was
associated with storage time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this skull inhibitor,
the main important genus effect we found
[SPEAKER_02]: was on Aureobacidium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually going back a bit,
this Cladosporium, people might also know
[SPEAKER_02]: that, see that increases in abundance when
you add DPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's known to be a mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the post-harvesting on it is that
it causes rotten grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't able to find a lot of it in
apples, but that's another thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: A table grape specifically, there's been
some work where it's been found as a rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of the things that surprised
me when I looked through is not exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what I found, but what I didn't find was
that when we looked at the abundance of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens, we saw that the fungicides
didn't shift the abundance at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we didn't do the big multiple
testing correction I talked about and just
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at what do these have like what are
the raw p-values?
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them were close to being
significant when we applied the fungicides
[SPEAKER_02]: designed to control them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after this, I did some more thinking
about, okay, what do I want my next step
[SPEAKER_02]: to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about a few things that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: DPA, this antioxidant has strong effect on
fungi, but we didn't observe any effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fungicides, didn't seem to have a
big effect on the microbiome and also
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't seem to substantially reduce the
abundance of post-harvest pathogens we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, which were both consistent
with the literature because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to see how other people found
the same thing and other people have,
[SPEAKER_02]: and no one really has an explanation for
it is what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking about, again,
going back that all these things we apply
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and manipulate the microbiomes we
can find consistent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also got a very good paper out of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for my next project, I was thinking
about the biggest results we found were
[SPEAKER_02]: due to things like changing a big harvest
time or leaving it in storage for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These factors through time looking at the
kind of large scale ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, thinking about,
well, we don't see these big effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides on the things we know they
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: That these kind of this large scale
community ecology approach of looking down
[SPEAKER_02]: and looking at all these microbes doesn't
always let us pick out very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions on specific microbes,
if they're not already so abundant that it
[SPEAKER_02]: shifts around the entire community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I got to thinking, what actual
questions can I take with this like a
[SPEAKER_02]: community ecology lens that I think is
very important?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that led me to look at more of
these spatiotemporal factors of how do the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes actually get onto the apple fruit
to begin with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can that be explained by where
they are in space and time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a fairly substantial shift
from what I had done before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you may remember, the title of
my presentation is about pre and post
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest treatments, this really isn't
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's looking at the spatial and ecology
and how that changes through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, looking through my results,
seeing low R squared values and not always
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects we were seeing, I thought
like, this is where I think we're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to find the most important
biological results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting into the actual,
what I did for this one, you may remember
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about these data at a grad field
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to also include them here
because they're pretty important for like
[SPEAKER_02]: the story of what I actually did and why,
and we'll be able to pick out some
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting trends from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So island biogeography theory is a
classical ecology theory that you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: here with this picture of birds,
that basically states that the further
[SPEAKER_02]: away the island is, the less dispersal
there's going to be, the less things can
[SPEAKER_02]: make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to find fewer different
types of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be less diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That here we can see these birds are all
able to get over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here on this island, only one type of
bird is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wondered, is that true for apples as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are apples lower to the ground in this
different canopy area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do those have different composition and
diversity due to different differences,
[SPEAKER_02]: due to potentially differences in
dispersal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our research questions here,
we're looking at these different canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: areas and the lower canopy, the inner
canopy and outer canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at, do these have
different microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at a couple of harvest times
to make sure it was consistent only one
[SPEAKER_02]: week apart this time and checking tracking
changes through storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we're interested in looking at
temporal effects as well, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at, to do a multi-year study this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a pretty big undertaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, a little risky in the sense
that like it's not using the bread and
[SPEAKER_02]: butter like post-harvest technologies that
I was using earlier on in HPHD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our hypothesis this time is that in
accordance with this island biogeography
[SPEAKER_02]: theory, that each of these zones should
have a different microbiome because
[SPEAKER_02]: different microbes can colonize at
different rates and potentially even just
[SPEAKER_02]: due to random chance of what makes it
there, they should be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we think that the lower canopy
should have the highest diversity because
[SPEAKER_02]: more microbes should be able to get to
here from the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this hypothesis really implicates the
soil as being important, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the main thing we found is that
between the years, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: variation explained.
[SPEAKER_02]: That for fungi, you can see that these
cluster are very separately from fungi and
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria, highly significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: R squared for fungi is 0.54.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 54% of all the differences we see
across the microbiomes for all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal samples can be explained by which
one was in 2022, which one was in 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: For bacteria, their microbiomes are a lot
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the R squared tend to be a bit lower in
general, 0.23, which is still a lot higher
[SPEAKER_02]: than we've seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we look at the canopy area,
we found that previously when we had done
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments, it was things like storage
time that had the biggest impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this study, it was actually canopy
area that had the biggest effect on the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome composition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that for our two years for
fungi, we see these again, these wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be high R squares by univariate measures
with like one treatment and one response,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for hundreds of different microbes
explaining 20% of the variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's quite substantial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for bacteria, we see the same
where we see a good deal of separation
[SPEAKER_02]: with high significant results and higher R
squared values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, this was very exciting and
looking at, yes, we can try and manipulate
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbiome through these technologies,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad I did those studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's also important to look at,
okay, there's a lot of variation even
[SPEAKER_02]: within a single tree here of where these
microbes are based on presumably dispersal
[SPEAKER_02]: because any physiological differences we
tend to find don't have big impacts on the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our diversity, we find that
again, it's a little complicated and
[SPEAKER_02]: messy, but the brown lines for the lower
canopy do tend to be the highest in fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we do the stats for the
overall trend, it comes across as very
[SPEAKER_02]: highly significant that the lower canopy
consistently has highest diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we see the same thing for
bacteria as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, I'll make another note on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This confirms our hypothesis about the
island biogeography theory that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and at least acts in the way that we would
expect if soil is the main source of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and they are being dispersed from
the soil to the above ground apples as if
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same way that like birds fly from
the mainland to islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did uncover some potential
compositional differences as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, I mentioned for one of my
other studies we did, kind of this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: big metagenome sequencing with shotgun
metagenomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did here is a little different
because we didn't have the money to do
[SPEAKER_02]: full shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So used a tool that predicts the
metagenomes based on lead bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: are called pie crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main results I got from this that
while you have to be a bit more careful
[SPEAKER_02]: with pie crust data because you're not
working with the actual metagenome,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just working with what you think
the metagenome should be based on what
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria there are that we see that over
half of the genes or KOs, these like small
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic elements that we're not
technically sure if they're genes involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these actually compounds that
can potentially be toxic to other
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, but can serve a variety of
purposes that over half of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: increased in abundance in the lower
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, my interpretation of this was
not necessarily that all these microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: are producing a ton of secondary
metabolites, but just that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: greater diversity of microbes,
a greater diversity of metabolism that you
[SPEAKER_02]: see that this is a more complicated
community that ends up producing more
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we zoom out a bit and look at the
broader implications here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that most likely this comes
from a dispersal from soil because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity patterns we see in the big
compositional differences that is most
[SPEAKER_02]: likely due to some sort of dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it matches what we would expect from
violent biogeography theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the source is the soil and microbes are
being dispersed to above ground apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also know that in controlled
environment experiments with Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_02]: this has been done and it's been shown
that yes, most microbes from the soil can
[SPEAKER_02]: colonize the above ground phylosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do that, the above ground
phylosphere, it looks pretty similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: what it would be outside of a controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really does look like when you're
looking at these above ground microbiomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: dispersal from soil, that is my belief
anyway, is this important factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having more dispersal from soil in the
lower canopy, it's a bit of a mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbiome, those study microbiomes,
people like to take the sort of positive
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it of like, yeah, the microbes are
here, like protecting the apples,
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting the fruit, but these microbes
could also have a greater risk for a
[SPEAKER_02]: post-harvest pathogens colonizing because
of that greater dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, my main takeaway is that when
we look at which I guess we'll see in
[SPEAKER_02]: these conclusions, that the spatial
temporal factors in this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental cost of ecology concepts are
very important for studying these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiomes that we can manipulate with
our technologies and get some differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what really shapes the microbiome,
what's there and what we can work with are
[SPEAKER_02]: these fundamental spatiotemporal factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, our different canopy areas
have distinct microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower canopy has the highest
diversity, which we are suspecting is due
[SPEAKER_02]: to this increased dispersal in accordance
with island biogeography theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we find some functional differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a part that I think is important
too is that, like I said, we see huge
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in the communities between
years, but the patterns, the fact that we
[SPEAKER_02]: see differences between these canopy areas
are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the different genera that are
different in the lower canopy versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: upper canopies, I didn't show all of these
data, but it remains pretty consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: between the two years that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it feels like this is really a
fundamentally important force shaping the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so, okay, zooming even further
out to look at kind of what I've
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplished in my PhD in two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that ethyl-mediated fruit mixture
[SPEAKER_02]: is linked to microbiome composition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found this in Snapdragon,
which has pronounced chlamycteric,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we found star results there than in
Gala, which doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could potentially be an important
cultivar effect as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This golden inhibitor DPA has a very
notable effect on fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fungicides have a little to no
effect, which was kind of surprising,
[SPEAKER_02]: but is consistent with the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at that, I looked at these
spatiotemporal effects, which I found
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to be really important in shaping
the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: With these dynamics matching some of what
we would expect based on the classical
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology theory, like the theory of island
biogeography.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and a lot of people helped me
through a lot of this work, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are here in this room and a lot
of people who have since moved on to
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger and better things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to say thanks to everyone
who helped me out with this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connor, can you describe the trees that
you were sampling from and how you sampled
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also whether or not the orchards
that you were sampling from were applied
[SPEAKER_01]: with any fungicides or macularicides?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Zoom, the question was,
can I describe basically what the trees
[SPEAKER_02]: look like, how we sampled and how they're
treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is specifically the tree that we
used for the, a set of trees we used for
[SPEAKER_02]: this last experiment on the different
canopy areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the trees that we used look fairly
similar with the second experiment on
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides, the Fuji's, the trees were a
bit larger, that it's this as most Apple
[SPEAKER_02]: people probably know these more modern
kind of like smaller trees that are easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I sampled was because even
back when I was thinking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: even back in the earlier experiments and
when I wasn't directly looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: different canopy areas, I was thinking and
Yosef is in the audience, like he even
[SPEAKER_02]: made a comment to me about like,
oh, you might not want to take the apples
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like super low to the ground
because like those might just like have
[SPEAKER_02]: more like dirt on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get like a different microbiome,
which was one of the things that got me
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about this question actually,
that I tried to make sure that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling each sample is like a few
different apples, like four or five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to pull them from
different areas on the same tree ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this were the experiment,
so a sample would be like, I would take a
[SPEAKER_02]: few replicates and each replicate would be
like, let's say four apples from here for
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower canopy, like four apples kind of
from here for the inner canopy and four
[SPEAKER_02]: apples from here for the outer canopy,
trying to get different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result for some of my earlier
experiments, I was pretty still going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris had the nickname Speedy Gonzalez for
me while I was sampling because I would be
[SPEAKER_02]: very meticulous in trying to pick out
different apples and it would take a while
[SPEAKER_02]: as a result and I would not have very many
apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that fully answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is that tree and like what's the
canopy width?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to get a sense of like what
the outer versus inner canopy is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tree is trying to... About 10 feet
tall?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to convert it into meters and
I was like, I probably don't need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we had certain like guidelines
for like what constituted like lower outer
[SPEAKER_02]: and inner canopy based on kind of rough
distances.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower canopy was about everything
below kind of like waist height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upper canopy was like everything above
chest height and then outer and inner
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy, we were able to...
[SPEAKER_02]: So just by trying to pick the ones like
really close and really far away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: center of the tree and then I'm also
remembering the other part of the question
[SPEAKER_02]: you asked was about how they retreated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much all these trees were treated
with fungicides throughout the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season, so that was like a confidence
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about, have you thought about
reflective fabric and like how that could
[SPEAKER_01]: break in your harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there'll be less soil spray or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was what about reflective
fabric?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in case people don't know, there will
be like reflective like... I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's made of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like aluminum?
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be this like fabric put down with
the idea that if the sunlight hits rays on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground, they'll bounce back up and hit
the apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because light is important for
developing the color of the fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why growers will put down this
reflective like shiny fabric thing to get
[SPEAKER_02]: more red looking apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question was, do we think that
that would affect the microbiome by
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially reducing the dispersal?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think absolutely would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would definitely be something I'd be
interested in looking into as a follow-up
[SPEAKER_02]: from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going into a bit more depth of dispersal,
there are a couple of ways that people
[SPEAKER_02]: have shown that dispersal from soil to the
above ground can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is through the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some classical microbiological
studies on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, there was one that we found
that it like mostly only occurred on like
[SPEAKER_02]: sunny days during the daytime was when
this happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't exactly know why, but that was
what they found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I think that's a lot of what
we're getting because we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the other way microbes can get into
the apple is through the root system,
[SPEAKER_02]: through the xylem that microbes... I
didn't notice until I started looking into
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually, but that a lot of microbes do
go through the plant xylem and into the
[SPEAKER_02]: above ground as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would probably be not be affected
by the effect of fabric as much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the aerial dispersal we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing a lot of when I do the Apple
wash probably would be affected would be
[SPEAKER_02]: my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of time, we'll take one question of
those one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, maybe this is kind of
alluded to with the light question too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we consider, I'm not sure if
you've looked into this, but consider like
[SPEAKER_00]: the spatial element of the apple,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just looking at the single fruit and
given off of what you were saying based
[SPEAKER_00]: off of like the microbes being transferred
to the apple through the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there differences between the case
calyx end and the other side of the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of microbial diversity at all,
or like just between the sun and shaded
[SPEAKER_00]: side or something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, what about
differences like biodegradable differences
[SPEAKER_02]: like within the apple itself, like calyx
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bottom and then the stem end,
the top or sun and shaded side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the answer is for calyx stem end,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a research group that's done a lot
of work on different experiments and they
[SPEAKER_02]: find consistent differences between stem
and calyx end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they find that the middle,
like the peel middle tends to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest diversity and the lowest microbial
count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, you might imagine it's like
harder for a microbe to survive there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the calyx end and in the stem end
where there are those kind of grooves for
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes, they tend to find higher
diversity and higher microbial counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun and shaded side, we're not totally
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny story about that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually like a little
miscommunication in this project where
[SPEAKER_02]: that was what Chris originally wanted me
to test with this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he was looking at, and then I
took it more in a direction of outer
[SPEAKER_02]: versus inner canopy, because when I do the
apple wash, you get the entire apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not able to look at sun versus
shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are methods that can be used for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other group I talked about that does
the calyx versus stem end, what they do is
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll kind of take a bit of fruit flesh
from the peel, stem and calyx.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll grind it up in liquid nitrogen and
just do the DNA extraction from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's mostly apple DNA,
but they get enough microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they amplify a small region
of bacterial or fungal DNA, they get
[SPEAKER_02]: enough bacterial or fungal DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to get some microbiome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did actually try those methods very
early on in my PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't end up working for a few
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that being that it requires a lot
more samples, a lot more sequencing money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it being the sequencing just
didn't work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them about it over email and
they're like, oh yeah, we have this fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: $20,000 homogenizer equipment thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, I don't think I can get
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to find a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was part of the impetus for why I
developed the Apple Wash solution,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also gives higher quality DNA just
in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't just do it because it was
easier and I didn't have the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were scientific reasons,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of caused a note to finish off on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
