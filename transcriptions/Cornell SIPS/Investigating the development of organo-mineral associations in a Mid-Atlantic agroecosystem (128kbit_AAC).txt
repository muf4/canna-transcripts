[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm pretty much going to be
talking about the work I've been doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil chemistry related work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I wasn't able to give a fly
fishing related presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't go over too well for
the A exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be talking primarily about work
that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it will be preliminary data,
but also some proposed aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall project that I've been working on
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three or four years in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off by giving a
brief overview of what I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide a background on soil
organic carbon and dissolved organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, adsorption in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to move on to the research
questions, questions that kind of motivate
[SPEAKER_00]: the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to follow that up with a more
detailed explanation of the experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: and the hypotheses, as well as data that
go along with the project, which
[SPEAKER_00]: encompasses both field-based and
laboratory-based studies, which look at
[SPEAKER_00]: widely different scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field-based studies are more focused on
the profile level, and the lab-based
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments are on the sub-nanometer,
in some instances, level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to wrap up with some
quick acknowledgments and hopefully have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to field some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we care about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the largest terrestrial organic
carbon pool on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This estimate here on this figure is 1,750
gigatons, which is fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it shouldn't be accurate,
but it's a fairly accepted value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bigger than the atmosphere and
biomass carbon pools combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it's so large is because
the carbon in these soil pools is
[SPEAKER_00]: considered relatively stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's there, it likes to remain there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carbon there can have really long
residence times that can exceed 1,000 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it's so stable primarily is
because there are some mechanisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: at play in soils that keep the carbon
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two big mechanisms are binding to
minerals and occlusion of the material,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not accessible to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the material gets in the soils,
particularly in the subsoils through DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dissolves organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a major input of soil carbon
throughout soil profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the fraction of soil organic
matter that is in soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is hence very mobile in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when soil solution percolates from the
surface, dissolved organic matter goes
[SPEAKER_00]: along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the material is sequentially adsorbed
and locked up in organo-mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: associations as the soil solution
percolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual adsorption process is pretty
complex, as DOM itself is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the components will adsorb
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's influenced by DOM properties,
such as molecular size of the DOM and the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the properties of DOM that have an
effect on the actual adsorption to soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sensitive to a lot of different
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that we understand fairly well is
that land use has a pretty profound impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a real big one that we know of and is
actually relatively common is the practice
[SPEAKER_00]: of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a land use practice that has a
pretty profound impact on DOM character.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much of what we know is restricted to
the plow layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that tillage tends to
make dissolved organic matter a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more humified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is rich in aromatic and
carboxylic type functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the molecular structure and character
of DOM, how it actually translates to DOM
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption, is not entirely known.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a model that has been
presented in the literature about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago by Marcus Kleber and associates
investigating the way organic matter tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to adsorb and assemble at mineral
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's based on some observations that
there is a really strong adsorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and other high molecular weight
amphiphilic molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amphiphiles, just going back a quick
refresher in chemistry, are molecules that
[SPEAKER_00]: possess both polar and non-polar moieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these tend to adsorb very strongly
directly at the mineral particle surface
[SPEAKER_00]: where they kind of rearrange and form a
base for further organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dissolved organic matter also adsorbs
not only preferentially through these
[SPEAKER_00]: components, but it forms patchy
multi-layers on mineral surfaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ultimately results in a hydrophobic
type
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic surface once the DOM is
actually adsorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is believed to be the result of,
I should say that was inferred to be
[SPEAKER_00]: additional layers of organic matter
adsorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these observations are kind of
taken together again and used to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: this contemporary model that is typically
pretty well accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some flaws with this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily based on bulk type
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really sure how it actually
translates to the molecular assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model infers molecular assembly,
but it isn't really based on any direct
[SPEAKER_00]: observation of those films.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I forgot to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not offset to suggest anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the measurements that we use
to, or a lot of the measurements that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using to form the basis of that
model were based on single soils where
[SPEAKER_00]: they have dissolved organic matter
adsorption to single soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these kind of measurements dominate
not only the model's basis, but also much
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we know about dissolved organic
matter sorption in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these soils aren't necessarily coupled
as a soil profile would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really know a whole lot about
the actual sequential fractionation and
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption of dissolved organic matter
through a soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, we're not really too
sure what happens when you modify the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter in DOM in the top surface
and its properties, how that translates to
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption both in surface soils and the
subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of brings me around to more
specifically some of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, how does preferential retention
adsorption of DOM translate to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter on soil particles
throughout the profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when DOM percolates and it
preferentially and sequentially adsorbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: what ultimately is going to be retained on
soils and what will ultimately not be
[SPEAKER_00]: retained?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second research question,
if we have a process at the surface like
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage that is altering the DOM
character, that is making it, changing its
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical structure or chemical size,
how does this translate beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is preferential adsorption,
how does it influence DOM mobility into
[SPEAKER_00]: subsoils where it might be retained into a
stable organomineral association or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next questions, I have two more research
questions, are a little more molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: level oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of are a little more focused
at the model itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the actual process of
preferential adsorption play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have dissolved organic matter that
preferentially adsorbs to mineral surfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see this by looking at single
samples, but we don't know what the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: process looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adsorption process isn't a single
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're analyzing a single sample,
we're missing out on some pretty important
[SPEAKER_00]: details such as are we actually seeing a
strong adsorption of amphiphiles directly
[SPEAKER_00]: at the interface followed by a subsequent
reorientation or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible there are other DOM
components that aren't rich in protein or
[SPEAKER_00]: amphiphilic type components that are
adsorbing first?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some things that we don't
presently know all that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last research question,
how do these adsorbed DOM films actually
[SPEAKER_00]: assemble at the molecular level level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the model is based on larger scale
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a measurement in scope
that exceeds the actual size of the film,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really end up missing out on the
actual structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot structurally resolve the
angstrom and small nanometer scale
[SPEAKER_00]: features of these films.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you're looking at this
entire film and you're taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement that exceeds it in scale,
you might be able to measure it and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this film is composed of four orange
spheres, four green, and four red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, you could do the
same thing with this film and come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, the assembly of these two
films is not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we were pretty
interested in looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get in now and talk a
little bit about the actual experiments we
[SPEAKER_00]: have set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start off with the
field-based experiments, which are more
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented towards research questions one
and two that look at soil profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field sites I've been using are
located in central Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of down near Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down at the Russell E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larson Agricultural Research Center in
Rock Springs, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smack dab in the middle of the state
and nice and nestled in between the Ridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and Valley province down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plots we're using are part of a
longer tillage experiment that was
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated back in 1978.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are three overall treatments
that were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a chisel disking, a moldboard
disking, and a no-till treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to use the moldboard disking
and the no-till plots because the
[SPEAKER_00]: moldboard disking is probably a little
more rigorous and might play out in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plots that are tilled,
they're tilled annually in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these plots are planted using a
soybean, oat, and corn rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plots, the soil that's
underneath them is what is known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hagerstown soil series, which is an alpha
cell developed over a limestone residual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It results in silt-loam topsoil and a
silty clay subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty smooth in horizonation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mineralogy of these soils is
dominated by iron oxides and illite,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not quite so easy to make out
here, but the cores on the left represent
[SPEAKER_00]: a tilled plot, and the ones on the right
represent a no-till plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within these plots that we have laid
out, both the tilled and the no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: plots, we have sets of five lysimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each set, actually, each lysimeter is
placed at a different depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lysimeters placed at 72,
50, 35, 20, and 12 centimeters depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was controlled primarily by the
actual, if we were to go too much deeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd start hitting bedrock in some places,
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to be limited there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these lysimeters, we're going to
collect the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to analyze it in a few
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to determine the amount of
carbon and nitrogen in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at the dissolved
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the organic matter that has not
preferentially associated to soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains in the dissolved organic matter
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at the relative
molecular composition using a technique
[SPEAKER_00]: known as FTIR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to speciate molecular functional
groups, such as aromatic or amide type
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also going to use a technique
known as HPSEC, or high performance size
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusion chromatography, to look at the
relative molecular size of the DOM that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this, too, is a factor in preferential
absorption of dissolved organic matter to
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also going to collect and analyze
the material that is actually on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to collect them from the
same depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the lysimeters we're at, the cores be
fractioned out into five different
[SPEAKER_00]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we analyzed them thus far for organic
carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the relative molecular
composition of the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be, at some point,
determining the fractional surface
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's believed that it absorbs to form
patches on mineral surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be interesting to see how these
structures actually develop throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for question one, where we're more
focused on just in general, how does this
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning play out throughout the soil
profile, I think some general trends are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I think the material
that is on the soils, which is organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that has over the years
preferentially associated with the soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be heavily enriched in amide
type groups, aromatic type groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: and carboxylic type groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be throughout the
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ample evidence both from
laboratory and field-based experiments in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature that suggest these groups
adsorb very strongly to soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe these are going to be
prevalent throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the surface, I think it's possible we
might actually be able to detect some
[SPEAKER_00]: aliphatic and carbohydrate type carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only going to be present near the
surface where we have thicker films and
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps multilayer type associations that
will be observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dissolved organic matter,
the material that will not be selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: associating with the soils, I believe is
going to be primarily enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxylic type groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might see a little bit of aliphatic
type contribution, representative of
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for question two, and this was the
question again that was focused on looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the difference between tillage and
no-till, basically investigating the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of tillage on the preferential
association process throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a comparison,
a relative comparison between the till and
[SPEAKER_00]: the no-till soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think in general,
these soils are going to follow the trends
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned on a previous page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between the two, I think there will be
some differences that will be observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I think the no-till soil will
have relatively higher aliphatic and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate type content as the material
won't be as humified or as broken down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface soil at the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the profile, I think
especially once we get into the subsoils,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go back to seeing a real
rich presence of aromatic carboxylic and
[SPEAKER_00]: amide type functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the dissolved organic matter in
these soils, I think the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: functional groups that are going to be
present, again, are going to be carboxylic
[SPEAKER_00]: type groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the no-till soil, I believe,
is going to have somewhat of an enrichment
[SPEAKER_00]: of aliphatic type structures relative to
the tilled soil, which again, is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more humified, more broken down,
more enriched in more recalcitrant type
[SPEAKER_00]: functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've mentioned what we plan on doing or
have done to some extent and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of show you guys a
little bit of the preliminary data we have
[SPEAKER_00]: from these experiments so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic carbon content of the tilled
soil, and this is just one of the tilled
[SPEAKER_00]: soils that is from the settle isometers
that was in the middle of the moldboard
[SPEAKER_00]: till plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real surprises with the organic
carbon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the plow layer, we have a pretty
uniform distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below that point, it drops off.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, we have a carbon zane
spectrum, which kind of provides some
[SPEAKER_00]: insight as to the actual character of the
organic matter that is associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of interesting in this case,
because you look within the plow layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: where your organic carbon contents are
pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do see some differences in the
spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this little broad shoulder here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But throughout the profile, generally
speaking, what you observe is a relative
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease of amide and carboxylic type
carbon with depth relative to aromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, which is seen to increase with
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a similar type trend is observed with
the no-till soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least with respect to the distribution
of the functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem to be quite as pronounced
as it is in the till plots, but you do see
[SPEAKER_00]: with depth the relative intensity of these
amide and carboxylate type peaks here with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to these aromatic type groups does
change with depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your organic carbon content is,
again, probably not much of a surprise to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot higher at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also undergoes a kind of
gradual decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can tell there's no real
homogenization there of the topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quickly showed you guys some of what
we know about the material that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: on the soils, the organic matter that is
associated with the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also took a little bit of DOM from the
lysimeters and characterized it with FTIR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these spectra are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I kind of want to get out of the
way first is that this peak here,
[SPEAKER_00]: at first I'm like, oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think I was going to find much
organic material in this solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that peak and I was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I noticed it looked shockingly
similar to a nitrate standard I had
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nitrate is obviously not DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of presented a bit of an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and actually checked the
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a fair amount of nitrate in
these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good news is I also took a UV vis
spectrum of these soils, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: used as a broad is DOM there, is it not
there kind of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these characteristic shoulders and
little foot slopes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're indicative of DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to those pretty stark
nitrate peaks, we can discern a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: other features, primarily the presence of
carboxylate functionalities, both the
[SPEAKER_00]: symmetric and asymmetric groups,
as well as some presence of CO and CC
[SPEAKER_00]: stretches, which you'll find in aliphatic
or carbohydrate type functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these appear to be somewhat
slightly more pronounced and enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: the no-till soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to really say at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just from one set of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions from the field
experiments thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: SOM character, it is not evenly
distributed throughout the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, material that was
preferentially retained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to kind of get an idea
of what's going on below the plow layer in
[SPEAKER_00]: tilled systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about just the
concentration of the carbon, but starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a molecular viewpoint of what the
actual organic matter on the soils looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily the assembly of the
structure at this point, but in general
[SPEAKER_00]: what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still a lot of work yet to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go out and determine the
organic matter coverage of these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a little more time with those Zane
spectra that I showed of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter characterization on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe try to make a little more sense of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also pretty critical at this point to
actually continue collecting and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil solution and do it seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a pretty dynamic fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be important to make
sure if we see any differences or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, it's not simply the result of
a seasonal transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would also be nice to finally get
around to characterizing the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter in the DOM now that we know
it's actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that was the field part of my
research and the general project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit about
the laboratory experiments we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've used and are going to continue to
use a series of spectroscopic type
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments that will allow us to actually
directly probe the interaction of
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved organic matter as well as model
organic matter with soil minerals on a
[SPEAKER_00]: really small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two techniques in general are going to be
used here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is known as attenuated total
reflectance Fourier transform infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of brevity, I'm going to call
it ATR-FTIR from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy or XPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will allow us to get in there and
really resolve some fine scale structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something on the order of a couple
angstroms to a nanometer or two is very
[SPEAKER_00]: much in play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's exciting about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned we're going to be using
some DOM models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are going to be useful because
they allow for a better mechanistic
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what's actually
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as complex as DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little easier to discern what's
happening when you use model type
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that you can fully characterize
and understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we elected to use bovine serum albumin
and DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both biopolymers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're found not necessarily
themselves in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you're not going to find BSA
in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will find globular proteins in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general structure of BSA and all
proteins is pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a backbone composed of amino acid
groups that are polymerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will get some changes in side
chain structure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these orient themselves in secondary
and tertiary type arrangements to give
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good model because there are
globular proteins in soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BSA itself is very well characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is found in soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exuded by soil organisms and is
therefore readily available to react with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil minerals as a part of the DOM
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, like BSA, is a biopolymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only in this case, the main backbone type
structure is a pentose sugar that's
[SPEAKER_00]: connected via phosphate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle, there are nucleobases
that are kind of used to kind of glue the
[SPEAKER_00]: helices together to form DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also use model minerals in these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They unfortunately aren't very compatible
with whole soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model minerals we elected to use are
ferrihydrite and montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both very different, but also both very
reactive towards organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should hopefully give us a pretty
good idea of what's going on with two
[SPEAKER_00]: different distinct minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferrihydrite is a short-range ordered,
poorly crystalline iron hydroxide type
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its surface is composed of hydrophilic
pH-dependent surface sites, as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: charge is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crystallites that we synthesized
are pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a real nice high reactive
surface area, and they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 10 nanometers in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an AFM image of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows a general topography of the
film of ferrihydrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montmorillonite, on the other hand,
is a crystalline 2 to 1 aluminosilicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also has pH-dependent charge on the
hydrophilic edge sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the structure itself also has a
pH-independent charge that is situated,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, on the saloxane sheet,
or perhaps in the octahedral sheet in
[SPEAKER_00]: montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're two very distinct minerals
we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one technique I mentioned
previously was ATR-FTIR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a suitable technique for what
we're looking to do, because it's highly
[SPEAKER_00]: surface sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses infrared radiation,
which is very informative when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about molecular-level
mechanistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probes molecular vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you combine its surface
sensitivity with the information it
[SPEAKER_00]: provides, it is a pretty useful technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pretty much works by just
reflecting an infrared beam off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond element, which we have upstairs in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's reflected, it creates a
sampling wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That penetrates the sample on an order of
about a half to one micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that allows you to do is just look
at adsorbed molecules and not get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a contribution from the solution phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these experiments, again, focused at
the last two questions that look at DOM
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption process, as well as film
assembly, are going to be run in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to deposit a mineral film
on this reflective element that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the material adsorbs with time,
as it's drawn in, like for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: we expose the film to a DOM solution at
time zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the adsorption progresses,
material is drawn onto the film,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it adsorbs and changes structures
until it reaches what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically call an apparent equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, we can kind of
characterize the film and then compare
[SPEAKER_00]: material that's adsorbed at all time
points to the whole DOM and actually look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the fractional and preferential
association of DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other technique we're going to take
a look at is going to be XPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is surface sensitive,
like in the same sense that ATR-FTIR is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get the whole bulk
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATR-FTIR will likely characterize the
entire DOM film.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only going to get the surface
maybe 5 to 10 nanometers or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is going to tell us about
that surface 5 to 10 nanometers is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on on the atomic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an elementally specific
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probes elemental transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be sensitive to
adsorbate structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something adsorbs to, let's say,
this model material, mineral film,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be able to detect the structures
as the reaction progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to giving adsorbate
structure, it can also be used to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual thickness of the XPS films,
or excuse me, the DOM films, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the fractional surface coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these experiments are going to look
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to expose a model mineral
film, be it ferrihydrite or
[SPEAKER_00]: montmorillonite, to a DOM solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take samples at a fixed set
of time points we have to work out yet and
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze them with XPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is going to do is let us
look at the surface most layer only at
[SPEAKER_00]: each time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be very handy, especially
when coupled with ATR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll let us know not only the bulk type
structures, but also what the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: film looks like, which would be useful in
resolving assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my hypotheses about what we're
going to see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For question three, how do I think the
actual preferential adsorption throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole process is going to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that early on in the adsorption
process with the models, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see approximate amounts of DNA and BSA
being adsorbed to the minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once adsorption is finally
complete, though, BSA will ultimately be
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go into this a little bit more in
the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the dissolved organic matter,
the real more complex solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can kind of, at least I've
pretty much assumed that initially we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a real rich presence of
aromatic and carboxylic type DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the adsorption process is
actually complete, this is still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the dominant feature, but it will also
be complemented by some aliphatic or
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate type DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I think the assembly is
actually going to look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that BSA, both on ferrihydrite and
montmorillonite, is going to form pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform multi-layers, as it's been pretty
well documented in literature that BSA
[SPEAKER_00]: will do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, I think, is going to form patchy
monolayer associations, primarily through
[SPEAKER_00]: binding of backbone phosphates with edge
sites on montmorillonite or directly on
[SPEAKER_00]: ferrihydrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when both are present, I think we're
going to have patchy type associations of
[SPEAKER_00]: varying thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much where BSA adsorbs first,
I think you're going to continue to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup of BSA as the adsorption
progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where DNA adsorbs first, I think
that's going to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the remaining negative charge on
the DNA will cancel out further
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for DOM, I think there is going to be
a uniform multi-layered distribution on
[SPEAKER_00]: both soil minerals with a base formed up
of aromatic and carboxylic rich DOM that
[SPEAKER_00]: aliphatic and carbohydrate type organic
matter will then adsorb onto once the film
[SPEAKER_00]: is complete, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to quickly get into some
preliminary results here from the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory-based experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is BSA again, the globular protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we exposed this to a ferrihydrite
film, we saw some pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BSA by itself in solution is this black
curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's got the amide 1,
2, and 3 bands in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are basically in reference to
BSA structures, pre-elementary structures
[SPEAKER_00]: on the BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon adsorption, which is this red
curve you see here, after five hours it
[SPEAKER_00]: had pretty much reached equilibrium by
then, you see some side chain vibrations
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're definitely most interested in
the amide 1 band, as this represents some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty key structural vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is typically used to look at
protein conformational change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take a closer look at the amide
1 band, we see some pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band itself is composed of three
different components, one of which is
[SPEAKER_00]: assigned to beta sheets, which is a type
of secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is contributed to by beta sheets and
turns, and alpha helices and random
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all secondary-type
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that in solution,
we have this distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once BSA adsorbs, we end up with a
different distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some pretty substantial changes
throughout the adsorption process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that there is some
conformational change of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conclusion from the infrared data
that you see up here was pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforced by the XPS data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black curve you see on the bottom is
BSA, the standard we were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red curve represents the BSA that
is adsorbed onto Fe-oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spectrum shows the C1S amide
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thought the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectrum in general shows the C1S
transition of BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see there's a change and an
increase in this peak here, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: amide contribution to the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, suggests that something's
going on throughout this adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, on the other hand, there are no amide
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we look at structurally
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at DNA structure,
especially talking about adsorption,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you look at the backbone phosphates to
see if they play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it looks like they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the aqueous phase spectrum of DNA,
and this is FTIR, so it's looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrations, is in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it is adsorbed onto iron oxide
for about five hours or so, you see the
spectrum change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectrum that popped out in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big shift in both the
anti-symmetric and symmetric phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrations upon adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this insinuates that there is perhaps
a direct binding of the DNA backbone to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ferrihydride surface, possibly through
a hydroxyl type replacement mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also reinforced by XPS again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at our DNA standard that's
down here in black, and the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: transition of the adsorbed DNA,
you can see there's a shift in energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an increased shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to really make a whole lot of
sense out of this at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is indicative of some kind of a
chemical change occurring to phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is an elementally specific
spectrum for P. So the mixed systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: we combined the two, like I mentioned we
were going to do previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solution, again, is here in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see features from both
biomolecules in the solution spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon adsorption, some things clearly
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say exactly what,
because there are some overlapping bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the XPS data really
became really helpful, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to discern a lot of structural
information from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the XPS data kind of shed some light
on the structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the C1S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the carbon spectrum of the
one-to-one material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see down here in blue is
adsorbed DNA, and up here in red is
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorbed BSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the individual components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you combine them and you look at
the adsorbed film from the one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, you can see that amide-1 bump
is appearing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of looks like BSA is
reorienting even in mixed systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also looks like phosphorus might be
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This top peak here is the phosphorus of
DNA adsorbed by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom peak in black here is the DNA
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle, this green peak,
is the phosphorus spectrum from the
[SPEAKER_00]: combined system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there is a slight shift,
as in DNA adsorbed by itself, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these spectra kind of show that
there is still some structural alteration
[SPEAKER_00]: and likely direct coordination or
association of both at the interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing these XPS analyses
yielded, which I thought was pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the actual ratio of the biomolecules
that were adsorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the P signal, we can see how much it
was diluted in the one-to-one,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are both biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that and quickly looked at it
and saw that there was a relative
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of 60% BSA and 40% DNA
adsorbed, kind of suggesting that both
[SPEAKER_00]: were, neither one is severely
out-competing the other, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole DOM experiments, this is DOM
I extracted from a no-till surface soil
[SPEAKER_00]: using a water extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed it over a ferrihydrite film for
the course of 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of what I had expected in the
hypotheses, we saw a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment of carboxylate-type groups
compared to the whole DOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole DOM is here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the DOM that has not been
fractionated by adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the material adsorbs, it becomes
increasingly rich in carboxylate-type
[SPEAKER_00]: groups relative to carbohydrate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of the opposite of what you
might see in the whole DOM, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: richer, totally speaking, in aliphatic and
carbohydrate-type vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some conclusions from the lab
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preliminary data, they reveal some new
perspectives on organo-mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: associations and soil organic matter as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new approach to DOM adsorption has been
developed, kind of looking at the process
[SPEAKER_00]: in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then monitoring it with XPS separately
is pretty new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to yield some good
results in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mixed systems, they show only a
small preference for amphiphiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in pretty direct contrast to what
you might find in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, the foundation of this
Claver model that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also still a lot of work that
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to run some more adsorption
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps try using DOM from lysimeters,
which is a little more gentle,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps more relevant, rather than shaking
it out in a lab and beating the DOM out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few other things that need
to get done, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to run short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have some time for some
questions, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, I'm going to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to acknowledge my lab group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need Martinez, Aubrey Fine, Mariela
Garcia, the folks, all you guys here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the section of soil and crop sciences here
at Cornell, as well as the folks down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Ecosystem Science and
Management at Penn State for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years of assistantship support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my funding comes from the NSF
cross-scale biogeochemistry program here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd definitely like to acknowledge
those guys, as well as scientists John
[SPEAKER_00]: Shue, Mark Beeson, and Mary Severson for
preliminary data acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, I'd love to thank
you guys, the audience, for sitting here
[SPEAKER_00]: and listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I welcome any questions and or
suggestions at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
