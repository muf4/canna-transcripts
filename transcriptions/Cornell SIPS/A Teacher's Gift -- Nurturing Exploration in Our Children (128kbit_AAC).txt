[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I know the guy that he was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought maybe the way to start this
off would be to give you a sense of my
[SPEAKER_03]: personal journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my master's and PhD in astrophysics
at a university called University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recognize them at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was working in planetary science for
a little more than a decade and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I decided to make a switch to
full-time national science education.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been fond of both research and
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was in high school,
I worked as an amanuensis for the New York
[SPEAKER_03]: State Department of Vocational
Rehabilitation, working with very
[SPEAKER_03]: physically disabled students who were
brilliant trying to take them to the next
[SPEAKER_03]: level up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt that education was just so
vitally important to what it meant to be
[SPEAKER_03]: me, that when I had a chance to,
after my PhD, I had an opportunity to work
[SPEAKER_03]: as a NASA, I'm sorry, National Resources
Council postdoc at Goddard Space Flight
[SPEAKER_03]: Center or help establish a lab for
astrophysics at the National Air and Space
[SPEAKER_03]: Museum, which is the most visited museum
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave up the NRC postdoc in my thesis
advisor said, nobody gives up an NRC
[SPEAKER_03]: postdoc.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be able to do research at the
Smithsonian and also be able to tell kids
[SPEAKER_03]: about it and teachers about it and
families about what it's like to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: researcher was really, really important to
me because research and education went
[SPEAKER_03]: hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe what I should really start
off by telling you a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_03]: emotional experience behind what I did as
a researcher and I could tell you that my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends and I at Goddard Space Flight
Center had to build a very special machine
[SPEAKER_03]: called an infrared heterodyne
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was my graduate work at Goddard Space
Flight Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would take this machine,
which would fill a nice sized classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big machine out into the middle
of the Pacific basin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would take it to the top of Mauna
Kea, which is on the big island of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take it up 14,000 feet, almost three
miles into the sky, hook it to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: most powerful telescopes on Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And point it to planets tens of millions
of miles away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would measure temperature and
composition of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the very special laser system that I
built, which was my baby, allowed us to
[SPEAKER_03]: measure gentle breezes on these planets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to build a model of the
global circulation, the global winds of
[SPEAKER_03]: these planets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was sort of like an
interplanetary weather guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could talk hours about why you would
want to do that, why you would want to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at weather across the family of
worlds as a means of getting a better
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of what drives weather here
on Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really wanted to talk about the
emotional context of what it was like on
[SPEAKER_03]: Mauna Kea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, I have a slide of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the summit of Mauna Kea and you
see some of the most powerful telescopes
[SPEAKER_03]: on Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Keck 1 and 2 telescopes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the telescope that we used back in
the mid 1980s through the early 1990s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the NASA infrared telescope facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the summit of Mauna Kea is really
interesting because, let's see,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is Subaru.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Japanese national telescope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody know why it's called Subaru?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see on the back of a Subaru?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't named after the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see on the back of a Subaru?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the symbol?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japanese, Subaru means the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is the Japanese national
telescope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go up to the summit of Mauna Kea
and you go up towards the afternoon right
[SPEAKER_03]: after dinner, which is your first meal of
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you work all night and you come back
down and you go and have breakfast just
[SPEAKER_03]: before you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have breakfast with people working
from all over planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, scientists from every corner of
this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sit down over breakfast and you
talk about what you're researching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody might be looking at planetary
atmospheres or somebody might be looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for planetary planets around other stars
and how the universe was born or how stars
[SPEAKER_03]: form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a remarkable experience
because this place knows no national
[SPEAKER_03]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about humanity pushing the envelope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a few years back, a teacher came to
me at a professional development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, what does it feel like to
work on the summit of Mauna Kea?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it feel like to do research up
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I thought about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came up with really three levels of
emotion that you feel on the summit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that's really remarkable
is that when you go to the summit of Mauna
[SPEAKER_03]: Kea and the puffy white cumulus clouds
roll in, they roll in a mile below your
[SPEAKER_03]: feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're like on a rock floating in the
middle of the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the sun sets, and the sunsets are
absolutely spectacular, countless stars,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 stars fill the heavens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've been to a dark site here on
the surface of the Earth and went oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, looking up at the heavens,
that's nothing compared to what you see at
[SPEAKER_03]: 14,000 feet, almost three miles into the
sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here you are on the highest point
on Earth looking out into the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Milky Way galaxy is this double band
of white that just arches from heaven to
[SPEAKER_03]: heaven.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 stars fill your sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only word that I've ever come up
with that has some chance of describing
[SPEAKER_03]: what you feel in that moment is majesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are standing here looking out at
majesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's really remarkable about that
story is that you're not looking at it
[SPEAKER_03]: from the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's part of you, which means that you
are the universe contemplating itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a remarkable statement,
but it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next level of emotion that you
feel is when you shift your gaze down to
[SPEAKER_03]: the horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see all of these instruments of
exploration, this set of powerful
[SPEAKER_03]: telescopes that peer to the edge of the
known universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get this overwhelming sense of
history that's standing on the shoulders
[SPEAKER_03]: of past generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you are part of a legacy of human
exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that it works is quite
remarkable because every generation adds
[SPEAKER_03]: to the body of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every generation grows frail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every generation in that moment
reaches down to the children and says,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's your turn to take us where we've
never been.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be content in knowing that all of the
knowledge that was passed to me by prior
[SPEAKER_03]: generations, I give to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the knowledge that I've
acquired in my generation, in my time,
[SPEAKER_03]: I give to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take us where we've never been before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after all of that sweat, and toil,
this is the state of human exploration,
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing back the envelope of human
understanding in terms of Earth's place in
[SPEAKER_03]: a greater space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third level of emotion is really
personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it happened when the laser
system that I built is really persnickety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a detector that has to have a,
it has to be kept cold at liquid nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: The laser itself has mirrors on actuators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the actuators have to have a certain
high voltage feedback on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're constantly babying this
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the middle of the night,
something like three or four in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning, while my friend is controlling
this massive telescope with a joystick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were looking at Venus at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this big image of Venus on the
TV monitor with a crosshair as to where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting there playing on my laser,
getting it all back to normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized, hey, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing, for the first time,
the winds of Mars, the winds of Venus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you started out in Little Red Train
Nursery School.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: When kids, if I go to a classroom and they
say, where do you go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, well, I started in Little Red Train
Nursery School.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of grimace, because they're
trying to figure out what university you
[SPEAKER_03]: went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point is, I started out in Little
Red Train Nursery School.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figured out those gifts that I had
and those things that I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worked at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to a point where I made
decisions along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to the point where I was on the
frontier of human exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I took a personal step to
places I've never been, I took the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: human race with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what exploration is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't matter if it's science or
art or poetry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put brush to canvas in a way
nobody's ever done before, or prose to
[SPEAKER_03]: paper in a way that nobody's ever done
before, or in athletics, you do something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pushing the envelope for the human
race.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking us all where we've never
been before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I realized was the power of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one person has the ability to set
their sights in a certain direction and
[SPEAKER_03]: take the race where we've never been.
[SPEAKER_03]: The power of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those three levels of emotion,
again, are the sense that you're part of
[SPEAKER_03]: this universe, this majesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the ability to reveal how she
operates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got this sense that you're part of
a lineage of human explorers that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing this for countless generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And working together we're doing
remarkable things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a sense that just one person
has the ability to do something quite
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful and extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm describing science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that you hear in my voice a
level of emotion which goes contrary to
[SPEAKER_03]: the way you normally picture scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I don't wear a pocket protector.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a white lab coat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of my friends do have white
lab coats, but I don't associate with
[SPEAKER_03]: pocket protectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point though is that science is a
very emotional experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, let me broaden that to human
exploration in general, because in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little while I'll talk about science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the point that I really need
to make is that the scientific method,
[SPEAKER_03]: which by the way is taught badly often as
a rigid recipe for success as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: an art form, the scientific method is a
misnomer because science doesn't own it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way we learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way we explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's discipline independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just say, and let me ask if you
all have the definitions down because I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to tell you a little story very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the sun a star?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many folks are science majors?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say education, well,
education undergrads?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe sort of.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else is here?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an audience participation
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education grad students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Science grad students.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so good mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to ask these questions because
it's a good mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the sun a star?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the stars in the sky?
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, why does the sun look so different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it look so big and bright?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's really, really, really,
really close, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a galaxy?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're all stars, what do you call it
when stars like to hold together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our galaxy is the Milky Way.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: You all live in Ithaca, New York in an
apartment or a dorm or a house in the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of New York in the United States of
America on a continent called North
[SPEAKER_03]: America on a planet called Earth in a
planetary system called the solar system,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the family of a tiny little dwarf
star we call the sun in the local solar
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood in the Orion spur of the
Milky Way galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A galaxy, by the way, which has enough
stars to give 50 stars to every human
[SPEAKER_03]: being on Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Milky Way galaxy is in the local
group of galaxies next to the Virgo
[SPEAKER_03]: cluster of 1,500 galaxies, part of the
Virgo supercluster of 50,000 galaxies,
[SPEAKER_03]: which makes up the tiny little sliver of
the universe that nature allows us to see
[SPEAKER_03]: called the observable universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is your address.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, by the way, think it's high time
that every child on this planet is given
[SPEAKER_03]: the opportunity to learn that address
because the human race needs quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of humility.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good way to say it is we all walk around
like ships on the ocean at the center of a
[SPEAKER_03]: horizon, a personal horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the hubris to say that that's
the center of the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all walk around day to day just like
ships on the ocean at the center of a
[SPEAKER_03]: personal horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could see out in all directions
uniformly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the hubris to think that
that's the center of the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the center of your universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important for us to have
a better understanding of Earth in a
[SPEAKER_03]: greater space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me now just quickly, did you like
that story so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just quickly show that to you in
photographs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the nature of our existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go above Earth's atmosphere,
you get to see the starry sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one star looks big and bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sun in a natural context.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun is just another star.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only looks so big and bright because
it's really close.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a small star.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million Earths can fit inside the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million Earths can fit inside the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody know the name of that star in
the shoulder of Orion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Beetlejuice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 800 million suns fit in the star
Beetlejuice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 800 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put Beetlejuice where the sun is
now, we'd be inside it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would swallow the orbits of Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is a picture of the Earth from space.
[SPEAKER_03]: This spaceship with all known life aboard
where water, air, and land conspire to
[SPEAKER_03]: give rise to life, whether it's a
bacterium that calls a drop of water home
[SPEAKER_03]: or a blue whale that calls an ocean a
home, this spaceship is teeming with life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a photograph of the
continental United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see is California is in
daylight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the Pacific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nightfall sweeps westward at about 700
miles an hour at this latitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in its wake, we can see ourselves the
entire eastern seaboard lit up with
[SPEAKER_03]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's us at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a photograph taken not too
long ago, a few months ago, by the Solar
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynamics Observatory of the sun burping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the actual size of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a photograph taken by the
MESSENGER spacecraft in January of 2008 as
[SPEAKER_03]: it rounded the side of Mercury the human
race had never seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this craft came from the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from a tiny little blue world,
which is right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you from Mercury.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a digital image of what the
Voyager spacecraft was just beyond the
[SPEAKER_03]: orbit of Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a gentleman who you may recognize,
Carl Sagan, suggested that the Voyager
[SPEAKER_03]: spacecraft turn its camera platform back
and image the solar system from the
[SPEAKER_03]: outside, or at least outside of the
planetary domain for the first time in
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got pushback for that,
but he was successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are the photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the orbits of the planets from
Voyager's vantage point in February of
[SPEAKER_03]: 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the photos it was going to take
to look at Neptune and Uranus and Saturn
[SPEAKER_03]: and Mars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Earth is in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are the actual photographs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is Neptune and Uranus and Saturn
and Venus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mars was actually not in the photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jupiter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ladies and gentlemen, that's you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Voyager is traveling at 40,000 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's twice as fast as the International
Space Station or the Space Shuttle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could orbit the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could go around the Earth at that speed
in 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this incredible speed, to get to a
nearby star will take 80,000 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80,000 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just two stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Us and a nearby star, there are enough
stars in the Milky Way galaxy to give 50
[SPEAKER_03]: to every human being on planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now know that the vast majority of
those stars have planets of their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is you from near Earth,
from near space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go out into the Milky Way
galaxy, you see these clouds of gas and
[SPEAKER_03]: dust from which stars are born.
[SPEAKER_03]: Called nebulae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are a few Milky Way stars that
get in the photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is known as the Eagle Nebula.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a picture up close by the
Hubble Space Telescope of this region
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these little pink things are solar
systems that have just been born.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing where we came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an entire solar system,
planets and star, being born.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm about to show you is a
photograph in the direction of Sagittarius
[SPEAKER_03]: of the closest star to us, Proxima
Centauri.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the very center of the photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you take a picture of Proxima
Centauri, a few Milky Way stars get in the
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like 50 stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like 50 stars and 50 stars and
50 stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many blocks of 50?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 15 and 15 across.
[SPEAKER_03]: 225 blocks of 50 stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is enough stars to give 225 people 50
of their very own.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is less than nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that star right there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think somebody's looking back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time you look up at the night sky,
think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I firmly believe somebody's looking back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we think we would see if
we left our home galaxy looking in from
[SPEAKER_03]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what 300 billion suns looks like
from the edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look from above, we'd see
something like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a spiral galaxy where the spiral arms
are the sites of star formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a really cool photograph
because there is a star, because I can see
[SPEAKER_03]: the spikes over here, the crossed spikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a star.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm losing sight of any others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this one looks like a star over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are these?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are galaxies.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all galaxies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every one of these galaxies on average has
enough stars to give 50 to every person on
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how many galaxies we think
are in the observable universe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough galaxies to give 50 galaxies to
every person on Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you feeling small yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is another photograph of
galaxies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so has anybody ever read Horton Here's
a Who by Dr. Seuss, my favorite book by
[SPEAKER_03]: far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, murmured Horton, I've never heard
tell of a small speck of dust that is able
[SPEAKER_03]: to yell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what I think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why I think that there must be someone on
top of that small speck of dust,
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of a creature of very small
size, too small to be seen by an
[SPEAKER_03]: elephant's eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Whos in Whoville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you read that book, you know that
the Whos were calling out from a speck of
[SPEAKER_03]: dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Horton was listening with his
incredible hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was having this conversation with
the Whos in Whoville, the mayor of
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he spent the rest of the book trying
to convince the jungle creatures he wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: a crazy elephant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the Whos in Whoville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're calling out to the rest of the
universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only with spacecraft, but ever since
Marconi turned on the radio in 1896,
[SPEAKER_03]: radio and then television have been moving
out at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thousands of stars are now bathed in
human signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're calling out just like the Whos in
Whoville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the real question that
you have to ask in all of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: how did we reveal all this from this tiny
little world?
[SPEAKER_03]: The story that I told you that I started
off by saying, hey, I'm on the summit of
[SPEAKER_03]: Mauna Kea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking out into majesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I tried to convince you by
telling you your address and walking
[SPEAKER_03]: through those images, yes, it is a
majestic universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did we reveal all this?
How did we reveal all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say it a little differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did we reveal all that with something
the size of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something the size of this gave rise to
that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: What process did we use?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is exploration?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is human exploration?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the fundamentals of how we
approach pulling back the veil of nature
[SPEAKER_03]: on any facet of the universe and seeing
how she operates?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of a rhetorical question,
not completely.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inquiry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just fielding words here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to all these words.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all very powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go on to the next chapter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now going to walk you through my view
of how we revealed the majesty of the
[SPEAKER_03]: universe, that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about kindergarten, elementary
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about college, your college career
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to bite, I swear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: To learn how to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue you already know how to
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just takes a little bit of coaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you go to school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me switch roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're not going to want to do
this, but you're all parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect your kids to say in
answer to a question, why do you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_03]: To make the world a better place?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect there are a lot of parents that
will not say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they can essentially make a
living, get a job, support themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: their family, in a sense, reproduce the
family that is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want your kids to do better than
you do?
Do you want your kids to do better than
you do?
Do you want your kids to do better than
you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a profound statement because
it's so far reaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me tell you what I hear when I ask
elementary and middle school kids that
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And try to see whether or not that
extrapolates to your reason for being here
[SPEAKER_03]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids will say, I want to go to school,
I need to go to school because mommy and
[SPEAKER_03]: daddy say so.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first thing you hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go to school because I have to
get good grades and get a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have to make money, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get the higher grades,
well, I need money because I want a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you say, well, you're going to
eventually want a family and you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to want to have a mortgage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to or rent and you're going
to have to put food on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the reason we go to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you buy that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That has absolutely nothing to do in my
mind with why we go to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me start off by saying something
maybe profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we explore, we fulfill a commitment
to our own humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you should ask your parents
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever had this
conversation with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I were to ask parents, do you
remember that magical time when your
[SPEAKER_03]: children were first starting to express
themselves with sentences?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a parent, I know what that magical
time was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived through it with my son.
[SPEAKER_03]: You lived through it with your daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived through it with my daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That magical time when they're first able
to communicate with you and express
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all parents will remember that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you ask, what did your kids do
when they first were able to express
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said it in one of the words
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, which is a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids will start asking this unending
stream of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many questions, so overwhelming are the
questions that adults tend to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: squash it because they can't handle all
the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as we're capable of expressing
ourselves, we ask lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to change the way I said this
when my son was born because I remember I
[SPEAKER_03]: was in a family room with my son.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was before he was able to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just knew a couple of words.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was an avid reader.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I say that is we had this
incredible library of picture books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember those big format picture
books where like, every tree, imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: able, was on these pages in the tree book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the car book and the
truck book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember this moment in time when we
were sitting on the family room couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was the fish book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I turned the page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he pulled the page back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he looked at me and went, da.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I turned the page again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he pulled the page back hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went, da, da.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he pulled the page back really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he pointed to a particular picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what the fish was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say it was a tuna.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, da, da.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, a tuna.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he turned the page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what he was saying is, daddy,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before he even had the ability to express
that, to say it, he turned the page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're born to explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're born curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to do it because it's what it
means to be human.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also born with something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're born curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're born to ask those questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're born evidence-based learners.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we are born to poke the universe and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love to poke the universe and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a great example of a class of humans
that poke the universe really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really well are babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: A baby will poke the universe in every way
it can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will explore near versus far and up
versus down, texture and color and sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: A baby will try to figure out how to bring
that glass of juice in a way so that the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface remains horizontal until the child
can get the glass to their mouth and then
[SPEAKER_03]: drink it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about the articulation in the
fingers and the wrist and the elbow and
[SPEAKER_03]: the shoulder to make all that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the act of poking the universe and
seeing what happens gives rise to two
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, it tells us how the universe
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second thing it does is it tells
us how to interact with the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learn how to interact with it because
of the evidence it presents to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are born curious, and we are born
evidence-based learners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me start back with that first part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me not give the answer away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not knowing something is a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you start that exploration?
[SPEAKER_03]: Asking a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not knowing something is really a
remarkable gift because if you don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: something, you can ask a question and have
a journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the only caveat is that you
want to know it by the time the exam rolls
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the act of journey, the start of
journey, is brought about by asking a
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so let me give you some examples of
the magic in a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are common themes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used the word majesty a few times,
sparingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is majesty in a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was doing a professional development
with zoo staff at the National Zoo in
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were talking about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Roger Roscoe, who is a curator in the
Reptile House, said, Jeff, I know what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about because there was one
question that drove everything I did as a
[SPEAKER_03]: kid when I wanted to go out and explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, Roger, what was that
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I wonder what's under that rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was the question that drove
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what's under that rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would go and he would empower
himself as a learner to lift up a rock and
[SPEAKER_03]: see creatures that he never would have
seen if he didn't ask the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This brave new world of creatures that
live under the rock and don't want to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out in daylight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with a smile breaking across his
face, you know what he did?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I wonder what's under that rock
and this rock and that rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after he had done that with all of the
rocks in his backyard, he moved over to
[SPEAKER_03]: the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is what he told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that love of exploring the world
translated professionally into he became a
[SPEAKER_03]: curator at the Reptile House at the
National Zoological Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said to Roger at the time,
well, that's really cool because when I
[SPEAKER_03]: was in elementary school, there was a
question like that that I used to ask,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what's in that rock?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took my dad's hammer and I would
whack away at rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like on the outside,
they would be brown or gray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And inside, hey, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quartz in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd go to the museum and I would see
geodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen geodes?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like I would just whack rocks all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had this rock collection,
which I probably still have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhere in a box, somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I've told that story to a
number of geologists who said,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's how I got involved in geology,
whacking rocks open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the most powerful questions
are the most elegant.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far can I see?
[SPEAKER_03]: So on a clear day, if you're out in an
open field, how far can you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: A few miles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see the moon?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 240,000 miles away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see the sun?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 93,000 miles away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That star, Betelgeuse, in the
constellation of Orion, which you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: from any urban area because it's so
bright, that's 500 light years away.
[SPEAKER_03]: One light year is 6 trillion miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 500 times 6 trillion is 3,000
trillion miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a nearby star.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the southern hemisphere,
you can see the large and small Magellanic
[SPEAKER_03]: clouds, two neighboring galaxies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know where to look,
you can see the center of the Andromeda
[SPEAKER_03]: Galaxy, the nearest large galaxy to the
Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Milky Way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're looking two million light years
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That light started traveling to us two
million years ago and is only getting to
[SPEAKER_03]: us now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see really far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that one question, how far can I
see, provides this pathway for a journey
[SPEAKER_03]: of discovery that's stunning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a question is really, really powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's something that I think ought to
be an appropriate reminder to any adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time a child comes at you with
question after question, consider it a
[SPEAKER_03]: gift because they chose you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're helping the next generation of
explorer fulfill their commitment to their
[SPEAKER_03]: own humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see many of these are short enough
for 140 characters.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you answer a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, will that give you an answer if you
answer a question with a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you answer, sophisticated
audience, a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd go to Google or Bing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how you answer the question or is
that eavesdropping in on somebody else's
[SPEAKER_03]: answer to that question?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you answer the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: You poke the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to find a creative way to
interact with the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the case of my field, astronomy,
it's really cool because light from all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those things that we were talking about
before is streaming to the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Earth gets in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that light falls without any
importance on the surface of the Earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you poke the universe, if you
interact with the universe by putting
[SPEAKER_03]: large light buckets in front of the light
streaming in, we call them telescopes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you collect the light, and you're
smart enough to understand the information
[SPEAKER_03]: contained in the light, you can find out
how far and how bright and how big and
[SPEAKER_03]: whether the winds are circulating on the
atmosphere of a planet far, far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you answer a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to interact with the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think what I'm trying to say here
is that what we know, standing on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shoulders of past generations,
has come to us because we have found
[SPEAKER_03]: creative ways to explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're doing when we're just
children is naturally exploring.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not learning how to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already know how to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Babies know how to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we really need is a little guidance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like, it's the student's
classroom, and the teacher lights the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the teacher's classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never meant to be the teacher's
classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the student's classroom, and the
teacher lights the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that we know how to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to poke the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to frame a pathway to an
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you need to herd the cats a
little bit to provide the tools that will
[SPEAKER_03]: allow it to be a very efficient
exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've talked about what it means to
be human in terms of exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because formally, science is what revealed
the majesty of the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is science?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask scientists and engineers,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would they say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that different than what we've just
been talking about in terms of human
[SPEAKER_03]: nature, in terms of exploration?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we use that on Twitter?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what science is?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organized curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organized curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what science is?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's evidence-based learning for the
entire human race.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's evidence-based learning for the
entire human race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science grows organically from what it
means to be human.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're born curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're evidence-based learners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go into a process by which you can
really put evidence to the test,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go and I find out something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about this new thing I
found.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell all of my colleagues through
scholarly publications and at conferences,
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell all my colleagues about what I
found.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, I don't believe you,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you poke the universe the same way
and see what you find.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what science is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a torture test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an evidence-based learner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've figured out what the evidence is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've presented it in scholarly
publications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you invite the entire scientific
community to throw darts at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what happens sometimes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You find out you were wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what happens sometimes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody finds out the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the whole world goes to a
whole new place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So science, as I said, is a natural
outgrowth of what it means to be human.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next logical question in this story
is what should science education be?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting to a point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me go back to something I said
earlier, which is that the problem is the
[SPEAKER_03]: process by which we ask a question and the
art by which we frame a pathway through
[SPEAKER_03]: the noise of the universe around us in
quest of an answer and the act of pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: back the veil of nature and seeing
something wholly new and the joy that
[SPEAKER_03]: breaks across your face when you see
something wholly new is science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was I going with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, science education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that process in an organized way is
the scientific, well, let me say it a
[SPEAKER_03]: little differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: That process is the scientific method.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an art form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a rigid recipe for do this,
do this, do this, do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you that two scientists
approaching the same problem may go at it
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one scientist approaching two
different problems, well, they may go at
[SPEAKER_03]: it two different ways because the problem
demands it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could tell you there are scientists
that will not hypothesize to begin with
[SPEAKER_03]: because they don't want to bias the
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of science is done by poking it and
just seeing what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the scientific method, I think we do a
very bad job in teaching in classrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the more important thing is that
process of exploration and learning that I
[SPEAKER_03]: described, is that science specific?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about history if you want to learn
about the Civil War?
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of parroting facts and information
and here memorize all of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: or let's say Truman, the decision to drop
the bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of a bunch of facts and figures to
memorize for the exam, you're Truman and
[SPEAKER_03]: his Joint Chiefs of Staff and his cabinet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making the decision to drop the
bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that you would need to
consider?
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you can put students in
the moment, provide them a problem in
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and history becomes a language.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes something that is alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes something that is more organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think what I'm saying is that
process that I'm describing here is the
[SPEAKER_03]: way humans like to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way we're born to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's discipline independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore, my question becomes,
how then should education be conducted so
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's effective education?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you the example of science
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should science education be?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the nature of science education if
it's going to be effective?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so let me take you through a couple of
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: My thoughts on education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my thoughts on education.
[SPEAKER_03]: A question we should be asking,
but don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the role of education?
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's education all about?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of education?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of going to Cornell?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the set of objectives that you're
trying to meet?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not talking about downstream,
the job, the diploma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a tweet I put out that went viral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Student, why do I have to learn all this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: System, because we want you to get a good
job as a search engine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important for you to know all of
the state capitals by the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, you're 10, because that information's
hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gone through a K through 12
education system.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you remember subjects where
the educational experience was memorizing
[SPEAKER_03]: information?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel in the age of Google?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to throw anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's interesting is I used to
tell students years ago, I'd go into a
[SPEAKER_03]: classroom, and they wanted me to talk
about careers and how I made my decisions
[SPEAKER_03]: and what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to say something that I now
kind of sort of regret.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to say to students, you know,
knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you know, the more capable you
are to decide what you want to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So school is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to know as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if all of a sudden somebody
finds this humongous deposit of gold?
[SPEAKER_03]: What will happen to the value of gold?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll plummet, because there's a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look at Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the information age.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the knowledge base of the human
race online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, in the not too distant
future, I'm sure, a couple of generations
[SPEAKER_03]: from now, you're going to be able to plug
your brain into the human knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what then of education?
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge, and let me say this for effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe it to the depth of what
I'm about to say, but I'll say it for
[SPEAKER_03]: effect just to make the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge is virtually useless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were driving in the car,
and we were talking about William Penn in
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia, and we were having this
debate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, William Penn must be like five,
10 stories high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I pulled out my iPhone 5, and it's
like 547 feet high.
[SPEAKER_03]: William Penn is 54 stories up in
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the power at my fingertips to probe
the knowledge base of the human race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the power doesn't lie in how much
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The power lies in your ability to do
something with the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's power is your ability to use the
knowledge to do something with the
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, that's true in virtually
every field.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bold statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to education, we must stop
telling our children that knowledge is
[SPEAKER_03]: power, and we just talked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not about the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education should not be about the
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over here, education must not be about
dictating to our children what they should
[SPEAKER_03]: be curious about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really reprehensible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Forcing a child to sit in a classroom for
six hours and telling them what they
[SPEAKER_03]: should be curious about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That denies them, I think I said it on the
next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education that denies our children their
curiosity and their need to poke the
[SPEAKER_03]: universe is not education worthy of our
children.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the student's classroom, not the
teacher's.
[SPEAKER_03]: The teacher lights the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we take away ownership and learning
from the child, what we are doing is
[SPEAKER_03]: denying them their need to be explorers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm suggesting here is not difficult
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back to what is innately human.
[SPEAKER_03]: The journey is written in our genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book of knowledge is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should that tell us about the role of
education?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, let's go back to biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: The journey is written in our genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have to teach our children,
those babies, for instance, how to explore
[SPEAKER_03]: their universe?
[SPEAKER_03]: The journey, the process of inquiry and
exploration is written into our genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book of knowledge is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what should that tell you about
education?
[SPEAKER_03]: How education should proceed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't it be nurturing what is already
in us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't it be about nurturing the gift
of a question and inquiry-based
[SPEAKER_03]: exploration?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't it be about recognizing that
there is core knowledge?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you ask a question, if you understand
how to play the game, the art of learning,
[SPEAKER_03]: you recognize that there is core knowledge
that you need to bring to the problem at
[SPEAKER_03]: hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is core knowledge that we ought
to be teaching our children, basic
[SPEAKER_03]: conceptual underpinnings across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you find a pathway to address
that question and the answer is the
[SPEAKER_03]: creation of new knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The objective ought to be a student's
ability to go through that process and
[SPEAKER_03]: create new knowledge, at least new
knowledge to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So education, the title of the talk,
was A Teacher's Gift, Nurturing Education
[SPEAKER_03]: in Our Children.
[SPEAKER_03]: What education ought to be about is that
nurturing of exploration in our children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nurturing exploration in our children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, let me give you some examples,
OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe this is on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long day already.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, I didn't get to the other slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, education needs to be about
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be about process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are the skills required?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ownership and learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Critical thinking, problem solving,
navigation of an interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape, teamwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ownership and learning is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example for elementary school
generalists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you telling me that you want me to
allow unfettered exploration of my science
[SPEAKER_03]: class, letting all of the students go and
do whatever they want?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you, when I was building
the carbon monoxide carbon dioxide laser
[SPEAKER_03]: system for the heterodyne spectrometer,
no divine hand gave me the procedures on
[SPEAKER_03]: how to build it, nor would I have taken
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as a science teacher, say,
gives procedures for an experiment to
[SPEAKER_03]: their class, they're ensuring that no
science is going to be done that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because who owns the procedures?
[SPEAKER_03]: The teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've taken all of the ownership away
from the students.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're asking them to be technicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow these procedures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a creative compromise is for you to,
with the class, explore the problem at
[SPEAKER_03]: hand so your class comes up with the
experiment you happen to have written up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you hear what I just said?
[SPEAKER_03]: A good teacher, an artful teacher,
will be able to facilitate conversation in
[SPEAKER_03]: the class so that the class moves in some
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can get your students to come
up with the experiment you happen to have
[SPEAKER_03]: written up, why is that the difference
between night and day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who owns it then?
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ownership and learning is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Critical thinking, understanding,
logic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there should be a bar that
has to be passed for people who want to go
[SPEAKER_03]: into public office.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to pass a critical thinking
test.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying this to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aiken, the famous congressman who said
that in case of legitimate rape,
[SPEAKER_03]: a woman has the ability to shut down a
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Braun from Georgia who said that
evolution and the Big Bang are the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: lies of the devil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the insanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these gentlemen sit on the US
House Science, Space, and Technology
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a problem, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Problem solving.
[SPEAKER_03]: That art form by which you take a question
and find a pathway to an answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Navigation of an interdisciplinary
landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you took trigonometry and
calculus?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how many students that take
trigonometry and calculus ask this
[SPEAKER_03]: question, why do I need to know this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the math is taught in full
isolation from actual use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Math is the language of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to understand her and
understand how she operates, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak her language.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a language.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I were to teach French and you were
never going to use that French to talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: other people who speak French or go and
read the literature and newspapers in
[SPEAKER_03]: French and understand the French culture,
if you were never to do that, why would
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to take French just to memorize
vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would we subject our students to these
stovepipe math courses with no connection
[SPEAKER_03]: to why math provides the ability for the
human race to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: So interdisciplinary landscapes,
you've got to navigate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like opening a physics book and
closing it and opening a chemistry book
[SPEAKER_03]: and closing it and opening an art book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life is an interdisciplinary task.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education is an educational tapestry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And education ought to mirror that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm asking too much for the
education system but what I'm simply
[SPEAKER_03]: saying is that education ought to be
nurturing what is natural to human
[SPEAKER_03]: learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and as an example, as a working example
that I'm familiar with in terms of science
[SPEAKER_03]: education, which is now called STEM,
is if you've been doing good science
[SPEAKER_03]: education it had to be STEM because
science technology, engineering,
[SPEAKER_03]: and math cannot be done in isolation from
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my view is if exploration is something
that our children are born to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: do, and science is nothing but organized
curiosity and evidence-based learning for
[SPEAKER_03]: the human race, our children are capable
right now of being immersed in real
[SPEAKER_03]: science and doing science, which means
that science education could be about
[SPEAKER_03]: modeling real science, immersing kids in
science, letting them be scientists and
[SPEAKER_03]: engineers right now, not talking about the
science knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book of knowledge is not science.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you get from science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or talking at science, let them do
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the program that we did to really put
that to the test, which has been very
[SPEAKER_03]: successful, is the Student Spaceflight
Experiments Program, where we can say to a
[SPEAKER_03]: school district, we're going to give you
your own space program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to give you a real
microgravity mini laboratory and all
[SPEAKER_03]: launch services to get it to the
International Space Station, have an
[SPEAKER_03]: astronaut assigned as a technician to
operate the single experiment it contains,
[SPEAKER_03]: return it safely to Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like NASA, that school district
at the local level says to at least 300
[SPEAKER_03]: students, you're all scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And break into research teams,
and each team design your own microgravity
[SPEAKER_03]: research program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each team write your own research
proposal, which will go through a formal
[SPEAKER_03]: two-step proposal review process,
just like professional researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those teams will have their
experiments selected for flight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing this with fifth graders,
grades five through 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is stunning what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had 21,700 students fully immersed
in experiment design and proposal writing,
[SPEAKER_03]: over 4,000 proposals, all this since 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: Students are saying, I never knew this was
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers are saying, well, wow,
this is a completely different way to
[SPEAKER_03]: teach science.
[SPEAKER_03]: A project-based approach, immersing
students in every facet of real research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even get their own research
conference at the Smithsonian's National
[SPEAKER_03]: Air and Space Museum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I obviously have some very strong opinions
about human exploration, science,
[SPEAKER_03]: and science education, and more generally,
human exploration and professional
[SPEAKER_03]: exploration and how we teach in an
interdisciplinary way, subjects in the
[SPEAKER_03]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also have a track record for putting
that into practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that what we are in right now
as a test-based educational system that
[SPEAKER_03]: stifles creativity, that denies many
learners the ability to be curious,
[SPEAKER_03]: that forces education to serve testing,
and not testing serve education,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a recipe for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a recipe for success for China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I pulled that out at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I think I'll stop here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm certainly able to answer any questions
if people want to mill around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
