[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to tell you about the study
we've been doing on behalf of USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cooperative agreement with the
Ag Marketing Service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were really interested in
exploring what is the role for USDA in
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recognized within that,
that there is this sort of emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's actually a huge interest right
now, look at the country, in how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: support and cultivate urban farms,
carry urban farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does it take for USDA to support
the growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the challenge of trying
to understand, is it different or similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to how we're trying to support farms in
rural areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the unique policy and sort of
political issues that are facing these
[SPEAKER_01]: types of producers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we help them try to frame and
redesign themselves to be commercial?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was where they came to the
small farm program.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked, could you help us do this
study?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the interest was around
commercializing urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fully recognize and embrace the fact
that there's a tremendous amount of urban
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture happening through community
gardens and other types of structures in
[SPEAKER_01]: school gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those are valued.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about the idea of trying to make
a living farming in an urban area?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that what was interesting for us is
that, you know, we've been doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work in the small farm program,
focused on commercial, on commercial rural
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, too, is like, how will we
extend our reach and support the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of these types of farms in
urban areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how we came into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had several things that we wanted to
be able to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all is, what are some of the
different factors that have helped
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to the success or the sort of
challenge in an urban ag environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were policy investments or
community actions that supported the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth of these types of farms when they
were commercially viable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what would be sort of future
needs and ways that USDA could position
[SPEAKER_01]: and support urban agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the interesting pieces here is
that in urban agriculture, you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of convergence of urban planners and
activists really interested in issues of
[SPEAKER_01]: food security, issues of food deserts that
are all sort of clamoring to try to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out, is there a place in a role for urban
farming in the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is all part of the context for
why we set out to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a one year project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a whirlwind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was over 150 interviews,
and then we focus in on 14 case farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we really want to do is sort
of help USDA think about the next part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it with these results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to tell you the kinds
of things that we found in the work and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sort of tell you about the next
steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the issues around trying to
define commercial urban agriculture is not
[SPEAKER_01]: any different than trying to define
commercial farming in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use the cutoff of having people earn at
least $10,000 a year from the sale of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of our baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what your tax exemption is based
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no real good way of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of these farms, you'll see have
diverse sources of diverse product mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go into diverse market channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they and their income from the sales of
ag products is pretty sizable for a
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of their overall farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first job we faced was trying to
identify these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were confident we would find
commercial urban farms, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was harder than you would think,
primarily because we wanted to have farms
[SPEAKER_01]: that had a few years of experience at
least under their belt, three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and recently, there's just more and more
people getting into this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted them to be established.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to be willing to sort of talk
with us and share with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some challenges getting people
to trust us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk a little bit about why and
how that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we wanted also them to be able to
share some of their financials so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could really look at a little bit more
about what does it look like to be farming
[SPEAKER_01]: and how do people put together their whole
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also want to geographic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dark green represent the 14 cases
that we actually did the 14 farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they go from east to west and
south.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not very well represented in parts
of the sort of southeast, the deep south,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we did our best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lighter green dots are farms that are
profound in our study, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: represent commercial farms, but novel
approaches to urban farming or really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting new models of farming that are
emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's in the study a couple of
cities that are highlighted, LA,
[SPEAKER_01]: Baltimore, and Boston, based on really,
really good policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing that Molly has done an
amazing job of, and Molly has an urban
[SPEAKER_01]: planning background, and so it comes from
that perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I come at it from the
agricultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that we wanted
very much to do with each of these cases
[SPEAKER_01]: is to really analyze the policy framework
that supports the development of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So included in our study is, and there's
actually other resources available that we
[SPEAKER_01]: helped uncover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of create what we hope is a more
robust database of policies that can help
[SPEAKER_01]: communities support urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you a little bit of a
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the types of farms that we
have in the collection, there's 14,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Split in the gender of the farm manager,
so male and female.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our important components in our
work is having racial diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: represented in who we talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who were the farm managers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also wanted to try to capture new
Americans who are farming in urban spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of our farms is actually
Burmese, was a new American.
[SPEAKER_01]: The years in businesses from three to 23
years, some of these folks have been at
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really well established.
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, six years, in terms of
thinking about farm development,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would consider all of these people be
getting farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because USDA generally recognizes
individuals who have farmed for more than
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years as actually being stable farm
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And several of these businesses are at
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, one of the cases,
and maybe Molly will tell us more about
[SPEAKER_01]: that, we just found out lost their land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk a bit about what that means
for a commercial urban farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acreages of these farms range from 0.1
acre to 3.25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tenure and their ownership or
access to that land is at times very
[SPEAKER_01]: tenuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many of these, some own, and some have
some combination of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mix of structures, and we're going to
talk a little bit more about business
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, primarily because it has real
implications on income sources and the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual business strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these are LLCs and sort of
similar to many of the farms that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: in rural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some nonprofits and some farms
that have split their activities into
[SPEAKER_01]: for-profit and non-profit entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The range of revenue on these farms ranged
from $11,000 to, I mean, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like $12,000 to $1.5 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, $12,000 to $1.5 million is the total
revenue from these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a range of incomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll do is sort of share with
you sort of their farming strategies and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that plays out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might not use both microphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I only need one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to as long as you have the
podium.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to walk you guys through three
example farms just to kind of show you the
[SPEAKER_02]: breadth and diversity of the types of
farms that we were interviewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Karen Fresh Garden is the farm that Anu
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leitu, who is the farmer, is a Burmese
refugee.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been in the country for about eight
years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was farming when she was back in
Burma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she came to the States,
she enrolled in a program called New Roots
[SPEAKER_02]: for Refugees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's run by a group called Cultivate
Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do a lot to increase the amount
of local food in the Kansas City area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do help with this farmer training
program that assists new Americans in
[SPEAKER_02]: refining their skills, building markets,
and becoming commercial farms in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: have their own businesses, their own
income, to increase their opportunity upon
[SPEAKER_02]: arriving in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Leitu, she farms on her own land,
where her house is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a half acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she grows a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: She grows what she calls American crops
and Burmese crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she sells them to different markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But her primary markets are farmers
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a two in Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is kind of lucky in Kansas City,
Kansas, because there aren't any policies
[SPEAKER_02]: restricting urban farming at the moment,
or improving it for that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's able to operate as she needs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she did get an NRCS-equipped grant
that helped her get a high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_02]: which she put up at the end of last year,
which she said has improved her production
[SPEAKER_02]: of food immensely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the important thing to know about Leitu
and a few other people like her is that
[SPEAKER_02]: not only is their farm important for
having a commercial business, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: also very important for food security for
the household.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she says the best thing about farming
in the city is that we have our own
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and do not have to buy them,
unlike the people that she serves at
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very small, small business.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one I think a lot of folks in
the room know is Brooklyn Range.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Brooklyn and Queens,
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were founded in 2008 by a group of
five people who wanted to experiment with
[SPEAKER_02]: growing food on rooftops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have managed to get two sites,
like I said, one in Queens, one in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a 10-year and a 20-year
lease, which Ben Planner, who's the head
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer, one of the co-founders,
said is extremely important because he
[SPEAKER_02]: would not think about farming on a rooftop
or anywhere if he had less than a 10-year
[SPEAKER_02]: lease because the amount of work and
resources that need to go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are specializing in salad greens and
other things that are quick succession
[SPEAKER_02]: crops that can be sold for a high value.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing micro greens all year
round and have sales all year round as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only are they doing restaurant
sales, but they're doing a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: additional activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hosting weddings.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hosting big farm dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've gotten a lot of support,
too, not just from doing those other
[SPEAKER_02]: activities but from other grants and city
programs that have helped them get the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources to farm on the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you can imagine, it's not cheap
to blow all that soil up onto a roof,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would like more help with
distribution and to find increasingly more
[SPEAKER_02]: favorable lease terms to keep these
businesses alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are cognizant of the fact that
they are not feeding the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're specializing in high value crops
that are only going to white table cloth
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, they say, does not mean that
there isn't an impact because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing all these other things that they
hope are improving the food landscape of
[SPEAKER_02]: the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are they also using high tunnels?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk a little bit about
how that season extension has impacted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third one on the total flip side from
Karen Fresh Gardens is Green City Growers
[SPEAKER_02]: in Cleveland, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 3.25 greenhouse that uses
hydroponic floating rafts to grow about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget how many pounds they said last
year, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they own the land that they're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got help owning the land that they're
on through the city of Cleveland,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuyahoga County.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got new market tax credits,
which most farms can't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to talk about new market
tax credits, let's have a different
[SPEAKER_02]: seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably won't be any news people in the
room because it's not that interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a way that controlled
environment agriculture farms have been
[SPEAKER_02]: able to build out in cities and is not
available to soil-based farms because
[SPEAKER_02]: farms are excluded from new market tax
credits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a way that people who want to
develop buildings can actually get
[SPEAKER_02]: financing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that helped them to build out their $17
million facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're employing 36 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are a cooperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: While Evergreen Cooperatives, who founded
Green City, Growers is a non-profit kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of rural organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have three separate cooperative
businesses that they've started in a low
[SPEAKER_02]: income area of Cleveland in order to
provide a suite of resources to employees
[SPEAKER_02]: who come from those neighborhoods to kind
of lift them up out of the poverty that
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounds these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a program that helps them
secure housing and own a home in the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a program that helps them own a
car so they can get to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to make all of the things possible
to get these people to work while growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of butterhead lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that's very interesting
about that business is they don't only
[SPEAKER_01]: identify as a social enterprise,
but they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are working there
after one year can be voted in as a
[SPEAKER_01]: co-owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no actual return yet as a
co-owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the aspirations within 10 years,
they will actually be able to sell their
[SPEAKER_01]: share of the business and have something
they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously these are all really
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a challenge for us to figure
out how to present them, how to parse this
[SPEAKER_02]: very small data set that has a lot of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are just some of the examples of
how diverse it is per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are earning farm sales between $0.14
per square foot and $12.63.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are those that are focusing on
specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, microgreens, sprouts,
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a diversity of farming
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might have an effect on how much
they're able to yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk through,
Ania is going to talk through a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of how this plays out in terms of their
finances in a couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the farm product sales for these
organizations, these farms, some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: are organizations, are anywhere between 9%
and 100% of their total revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see where those other parts of
the revenue come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's worth noting that there's a lot
of diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them aren't relying solely on
what they're selling in order to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 10 of the 14 farms earned a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three are nonprofit farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we included them in this study of
commercial urban agriculture for reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: that we'll explain in a couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give you an overview of what this
looks like, we separated the farms into
[SPEAKER_02]: three categories just to kind of wrap our
heads around the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, there's some non-profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some for-profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people who are doing all
different types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of make it simple, we separated
them into program-focused farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are those farms kind of like green
city growers where they're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide more than just food.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some sort of social component of
their work, some sort of programming
[SPEAKER_02]: component of their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often they are non-profit or they have
a non-profit arm that enables them to get
[SPEAKER_02]: grant money and individual giving in order
to support the programmatic work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, that makes up over
half of what they earn on average.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's diversified farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So farms kind of like Brooklyn Grange that
are growing food for people to eat,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're also doing a lot of other
things like workshops and events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ends up making a significant
portion on average of their total earned
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's production-focused farms
which, as the name would suggest,
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might have a few activities that
happen, but those are more kind of one-off
[SPEAKER_02]: events that occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just looking at this, these
program-focused, diversified,
[SPEAKER_02]: production-focused farms, you don't really
get a sense of what that means in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, in terms of how much they're
earning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we tried to break it down in
different ways, looking at the ranges of
[SPEAKER_02]: income.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Anna's going to walk you through a
little bit of that information so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see what this looks like in practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to focus primarily in on
income and sales and profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have aggregated the data to sort of
protect the information from these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to be able to share with
you just sort of a breakdown of a total
[SPEAKER_01]: income.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little bit of what Molly had
shared on that previous slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we have a range of income anywhere
from, I think, around $43,000 at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, all the way up to $3.3 million for
total income.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we cut off the chart at $100,000,
or $1 million there at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the total income of our largest
operation was $3.3 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you combine both what they're making
from agriculture, as well as what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting from GRIPS scans, GRIPS grants,
and other activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's really important to note is,
of course, what's really obvious,
[SPEAKER_01]: the production-focused farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small total income to the farm,
very little done with additional
[SPEAKER_01]: activities, but also the majority of that
earnings coming from agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the diversified farms,
and the farms that are program-focused,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that are using a lot of
educational activities to supplement what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing, our differences in the
actual earnings by ag sales is not that
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what this does allow those farms to do
is actually to supplement income to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide, I think, longer-term employment
for many of the individuals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on the operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we take it then and we add to
this, and so these are ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these bars are just representing ranges
to give you a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to figure out how we
actually want to represent this for USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these bars are basically the top and
the bottom of a range for a group of farms
[SPEAKER_01]: that are included here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this business strategy,
what's interesting here is at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, when you actually look at the
orange bars, which represent the
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture-based sales, the income from
sales, and then the actual profit that
[SPEAKER_01]: they declared after you remove expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at those yellow bars at the
bottom, you can find there's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low profitability in those ones that
are program-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: These farms are doing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have really huge incomes,
but at the end of the day, the total
[SPEAKER_01]: profits from those operations are not that
much different from the very small
[SPEAKER_01]: production ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a bit counterintuitive for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're still sitting with this
because it is actually kind of surprising
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're not seeing in here is that
these are all farms of different sizes
[SPEAKER_01]: with different production capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other challenges in working
with small farms, whether they're rural or
[SPEAKER_01]: urban or any kind of small business,
especially if it's a sole proprietor,
[SPEAKER_01]: is how does the actual owner-operator take
a draw from the business?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of our farms actually do have
paid the owner-operator, the primary
[SPEAKER_01]: manager, from the actual sales of
products, and others don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just take what's profitable,
what's left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a really difficult place as
far as trying to manage and analyze this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's also the additional
draw of food that's supporting food
[SPEAKER_01]: security of the household.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you actually account for that
impact on a household income?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are sort of future research
questions, additional types of inquiry
[SPEAKER_01]: that have to happen, but we're going
beyond our scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in trying to think about the business
strategy that these different operations
[SPEAKER_01]: did, what's really evident is that even
though they had really high operating
[SPEAKER_01]: budget, these program-based ones were not
actually that much more profitable than
[SPEAKER_01]: very small farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were primarily earning from the sale
of ag products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that we tried to do is
because, again, there's a range of size,
[SPEAKER_01]: we tried to sort of represent this in a
way to help us sort of get our heads
[SPEAKER_01]: around some of this information of
earnings and profit and cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we use a small area, 0.1 acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a funny thing to use that because
when you scale up, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: represent things on an acreage basis,
that's really common in our work in rural
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that scale up is fraught with so many
errors and doesn't really represent sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of the intensity of production in these
farm systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually scaled everything to a
tenth of an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is a unit that really,
I think, represents the intensity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way these people are doing and managing
their businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it provides sort of a way of comparing
across these different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to use this same metric of
a tenth of an acre to look at a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things about these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at just a tenth of an
acre and you look at the ag sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden we're looking at a really
different framework between these
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where one of our farms is farming a very
small scale, is making $55,000 as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: their top end from a tenth of an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at that production focus,
the first set of bars at the far end,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, the total profit for that tenth
of an acre is higher than those other
[SPEAKER_01]: farms that had much higher operating
budgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So embedded within this is the controlled
environment farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that has the ability to farm year
round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a much higher earnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of lost in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really just look at a tenth of
an acre over a whole year, annual sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: the very small farms don't look that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key factors in affecting this
that is actually quite dramatic is the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of season extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of these farms, and I think
Molly will probably share more about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: use high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've benefited from an NRCS program
in which a producer can get the cost of a
[SPEAKER_01]: high tunnel pay as long as they report
yield data from that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these farms that are growing
outdoors with season extension are using
[SPEAKER_01]: high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you actually focus in on that
middle section, you can see that their
[SPEAKER_01]: earnings and their overall profit per
tenth of an acre is higher than those that
[SPEAKER_01]: are using controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to farm really intensively
using the soil based media here,
[SPEAKER_01]: based on this, our study and the sort of
information that we have for those
[SPEAKER_01]: particular farms, when they have that
season extension, it really did a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: enhance the security of the farm and
manage risk for the farm by increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: months of production, but also then the
total output and the value of that
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, these are ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left, the CEA, the range of the
farms are as far as a tenth of an acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like the oranges, anywhere from 47
to 75 is their total sales, but then the
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability is much lower on a tenth of
an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the again, it's difficult,
again, we're trying to sort of give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of different lenses to look at
this, it doesn't show you the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The months outdoors that people are
producing are varies based on the region,
[SPEAKER_01]: you saw the sort of range of farms we have
in the east coast to the west coast and
[SPEAKER_01]: the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people just outside, they can grow
outdoors, and it's just easier to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even our farms in the south are using the
high tunnels, it's a really tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: program that probably has had more impact
on those operations than any other
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention that's coming from USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another issue that this does mask
a bit is the diversity of the crops that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being grown on these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is actually sort of the next
lens that we wanna sort of give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that we've found
is that those farms that were actually
[SPEAKER_01]: grown, and there's a new category here and
we're calling it specialized, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the farms that are earning more than half
of their total income from the sale of one
[SPEAKER_01]: high value product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the times, these farms are growing
things like microgreens or salad greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farms that were able to specialize
actually had higher profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually kind of important,
especially in terms of thinking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall food security and the sort of
impact on community that these farms could
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they're having to be
profitable, they are narrowing the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of crops they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A salad does not a full belly make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the challenge of building a
profitable business.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you make on a square foot basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you earn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you have a consistent
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you take advantage of your
resources?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those farms that were intensively
producing fewer crops and those specialty
[SPEAKER_01]: high value crops for specialty markets
were the ones that were actually able to
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrate a more profitable business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones that were non-specialized,
those farms were growing a diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, often using a CSA or some other
type of a marketing channel or farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they were having to sort of
balance a broad number of crops that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to provide to their customers in
contrast to those that were specializing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so we can sort of talk about what
is those market channels that these
[SPEAKER_01]: different farms are using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're the same ones that we would
see urban farmers use or rural farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: using, farmers markets, CSAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does everyone know the term CSA?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is everyone not a community supported
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see shakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very common in from many small farms in
rural areas and for these farms as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going for a CSA, frankly,
is a lot to ask for a very small footprint
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to offer a diverse number
of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're moving away from that
specialization and your ability to plan
[SPEAKER_01]: and use your space most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always crops that don't make you
any money when you're going for a CSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those farms were not earning or
profiting as much as the other farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers markets market,
you're capturing all of that direct retail
[SPEAKER_01]: funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those folks who are using direct
wholesale to restaurants and other types
[SPEAKER_01]: of purveyors, so directly selling at
wholesale, they were, they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, they were probably more
specialized in what they were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't do too bad as far as being
more profitable than certainly the CSA
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still challenging to them because
they have to specialize in the
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability is not necessarily always
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so but the markets and again,
I always want to sort of add the caveat
[SPEAKER_01]: that for many of these farms, they're not
paying owner, the owner is not paid a
[SPEAKER_01]: salary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes it really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at sort of comparing just
about different owners taking a draw
[SPEAKER_01]: versus not.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, the owners are actually
paid as part of the expenses of the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then closer to me, they're not being
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're taking basically the profit
from the farm or other things from the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm to support the household and the
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They often have other jobs off of the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a compliment of income coming
into a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a wide, there's a basically a
fairly wide range of total income per
[SPEAKER_01]: month and on a point one acre basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that the sort of bars
right now as far as the upper earnings for
[SPEAKER_01]: those that aren't being paid, that's that
money is really going to the but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just not a good way to separate it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have information in our collection
based on labor hours and total labor
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things we're trying
to analyze is paid labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all these firms use unpaid labor
through volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that's fraught with a lot of
challenge because it's not actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: legal labor labor category in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really trying to work on
these issues related to volunteer labor on
[SPEAKER_01]: in farms, whether urban or rural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just gives you an overview and a
sense of the sort of types of farms that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the real take home message is that
these highly specialized farms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in soil can be quite profitable
and competitive in their areas if they
[SPEAKER_01]: have season extension technologies that
they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the word in some ways is still
out about controlled environment
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture firms relative to the final
sort of profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the caveat, we you know,
we're not completely comparing apples to
[SPEAKER_01]: apples here because of the way people are
representing their own salary draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the challenge across all farms
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of different ways to look
at data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured it'd be helpful if we
actually applied those lenses to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fireplace, you guys too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Karen fresh garden remembers the
refugee farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is production focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does very few other activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had received that grant that
allowed her to get the high tunnel that
[SPEAKER_02]: she implemented at the end of last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that did not actually figure into her
sales for 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: She really didn't get up and running until
January.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she doesn't actually fit that season
extension category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, she's non specialized.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's growing a wide variety of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her income for those I think that
there were seven I know there were seven
[SPEAKER_02]: production focused farms was around the
middle in terms of her yield per 10 acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sells for eight months of the year at
the two farmers markets that she sells
[SPEAKER_02]: through and those are her primary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were her only actually market
channels in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has no paid labor does not pay her
self a salary, but her family helps out
[SPEAKER_02]: and her her family members also have off
farm jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So together, they are supporting the
household, as is some of the yield from
[SPEAKER_02]: the farm, but she and every other farmer
that I had an opportunity to speak to over
[SPEAKER_02]: the past year did not figure how much she
was taking from the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hard to be able to put dollar value on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She pays herself in the profits like I
suggested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is an excellent record keeper when
it comes to her production, but not when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to her finances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she gets a lot of assistance actually,
through the training program that she
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with for four years, and then
graduated onto her own farm, the New Risk
[SPEAKER_02]: for Refugees program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she wants to improve her ability to
manage her own finances, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: predicated on her English language
acquisition, which she is not totally on
[SPEAKER_02]: board with committing herself to.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of reasons, including the amount
of time that she has, including the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that she wants to diversify her markets
and start selling to restaurants,
[SPEAKER_02]: because she sees that there's more
potential for her to be earning more money
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially if she works with restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Congrange is one of those
diversified farms we talked about,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, they have a lot of other
things that they do about half of their
[SPEAKER_02]: income comes from non production related
activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have high sales because they're
specializing in microgreens and salad
[SPEAKER_02]: greens, edible flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have two high tunnels on their
farm in Brooklyn, one high tunnel in their
[SPEAKER_02]: farm in Queens, and they are heating them
throughout the winter to grow those
[SPEAKER_02]: microgreens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have 12 months of sales a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they pay all their employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have volunteers as kind of a
community outreach opportunity,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they realized that it was costing them
too much money to have volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were better off paying people who
were skilled in their labor to do their
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have 12 full time year round
employees and another 12 part time
[SPEAKER_02]: seasonal employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are continuing to refine their
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do very intensive record keeping to
figure out what's making money and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: not per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're also scaling up their events.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're aiming to do 10 weddings in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't checked in to see how many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Green City Growers is controlled
environment agriculture, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they are program focused like I
covered before in the way that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting their employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of their total income is coming
from their sales in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're continuing to scale that up,
but the other half is coming from grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have significant loans that
are not operating loans, but just as kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of to keep in the back of your head,
this wasn't a cheap thing to start up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing all direct wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're selling to major grocery store
chains in the near Midwest region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to call Ohio the Midwest,
but the near Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone is getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The starting salary or the starting wage
for a worker at Green City Growers is $10
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour and they become members of the
cooperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their pay increases from there about a
dollar a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their big problem right now is
building out more markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built this facility and they say this
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built this facility and thought they
will come.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will buy our lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are near to about 14 major
institutions, hospitals, colleges,
[SPEAKER_02]: museums, and they figured this would be an
easy sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they didn't realize is that a lot
of those institutional customers don't use
[SPEAKER_02]: head lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want pre-cut lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are recognizing now that that
probably would have been something that
[SPEAKER_02]: they should have investigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very open with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just worth noting too, this is the
only major large-scale indoor growing
[SPEAKER_02]: operation either with in greenhouses or a
totally closed system with no lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: only using LED lighting that was willing
to be a part of our study.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those types of larger businesses
have great front-facing public relations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're not really willing at this
point to share information about their
[SPEAKER_02]: sales and about their technology because
they are trade secrets in this very
[SPEAKER_02]: nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just what those financial
findings look like when we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to talk you through a couple of
other findings as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farmers are largely self-taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surprising how many farmers say,
you know, four years ago I didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't usually treat their
dentists that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But farmers, I guess, there's a little bit
more leeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're working on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe there's a better opportunity to
learn more on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really want help building out
their skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: They recognize that they don't have a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a call for having extension
agents in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't in a lot of the places that
we visited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're lucky because overall their
support from the community is high.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is sometimes tension when these
farmers come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk a little bit about
that tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, the community support is
high, even if the zoning and legal support
[SPEAKER_02]: is not high because agriculture is not an
accepted use in most cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only in one of the cities that we profiled
a farm in was agriculture already on the
[SPEAKER_02]: books.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the farmers, if they had a policy
recommendation, I think it would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: be similar to most farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is ways to reduce their costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have high costs, high utility
costs, high land costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've benefited, like we said,
from programs like the NRCS equip program
[SPEAKER_02]: that helped them get high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to see more like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to walk you through a few of our
preliminary findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to do this quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land access is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can imagine, it's hard to find land
in a city to do farming, especially land
[SPEAKER_02]: that does not have a toxic history or you
can even find the history on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to add that this is also the
primary issue for people trying to start
[SPEAKER_01]: farms in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Anand covered before, and as I said
a little bit about, they are finding they
[SPEAKER_02]: are profitable when they focus on niche
produce and not the whole CSA calorie crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost of social entrepreneurship and
nourish are high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all of the things that you do that
aren't farming when you're in a city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking kids on tours and having a workshop
on beekeeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are things that people are often
doing for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a great community outreach
tool, especially if they're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: build knowledge of where food comes from
for people who don't have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that means that they're not farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they're not farming, they're not
making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water costs in particular are still very
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: For farmers when they really need that
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're often paying sewage fees and
storm water fees, which are extra on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of just the irrigation water costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, commercial urban farms
are primarily owned by white people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are farming regardless of where they are,
whether they're in a community of color or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in a white community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are usually the people who are doing
the commercial farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other sorts of farming that
happen in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for commercial purposes, it's one of
the reasons why we had a lot of difficulty
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a diversity in terms of ethnic
background and racial diversity and
[SPEAKER_02]: socioeconomic diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it requires finding certain things
or to get yourself onto land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to skip over the land access
piece because we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm happy to talk more about how
zoning has been affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I will mention is Little
City Gardens, which is up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one farm that we profiled that
has lost their land since we started this
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are out at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of the last significant green
spaces over a half acre in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is now going to be a school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hand over to Anu to talk a
little bit about the racial question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that's really apparent in the
urban space is the real tension around
[SPEAKER_01]: racial inequity and structural racism that
played out in every single one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities and places we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the kind of thing that we
talk about very often in rural places
[SPEAKER_01]: because everyone there is primarily white.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what has played out in many of these
cities is that particularly the
[SPEAKER_01]: African-American community is not only
trying to farm, they're also trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the health and well-being of their
communities, often lower resource and
[SPEAKER_01]: impoverished communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are systematically and
systemically not able to access land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually really deeply disturbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the issues that we confronted
ourselves in trying to visit and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these farms and build viable farm
businesses, but they're like, what
[SPEAKER_01]: difference is this going to make us to
talk to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's one of those places of
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has a social mission in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of our advocates here in New York
City itself, here in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: she just said, if you really want to help
us, just ask us what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell us what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come into the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask us what we need to support the
development of our farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's something that is
actually the center of the next step of
[SPEAKER_01]: this project is really how do we create
honest conversation around this stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: work with planners, policymakers,
and developers who don't have a language
[SPEAKER_01]: nor to communicate about this type of use
for land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we're going to do is just
we, this other piece that ties to this is
[SPEAKER_01]: social entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to take a moment to talk
about this with you because we,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the farms, six of the 14,
have specific educational activities that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really recognize that here you
have this farm in this urban area and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these people have no idea where their
food comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of our mission to sort of
change that and actively sort of help
[SPEAKER_01]: bring schools and get kids familiar with
how do you grow stuff and parents so they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the value of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a service that they're
providing and it is an unpaid service for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of agriculture benefits from this
activity, but yet it's urban farms on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own and they're sort of soldering it
and whether it's a community garden or an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual commercial operation that's doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean for all of
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How and where are partnerships with urban
farms like this actually able to
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate greater awareness that benefits
all of agriculture, not just those few
[SPEAKER_01]: little farms in those small communities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a contextual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we build this out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that these cases,
the whole point of the study has been to
[SPEAKER_01]: really try to elevate examples where
people are making livings or trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial on a very small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just challenging by the
footprint, but it's challenged by all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these other socioeconomic and cultural
things going on around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like we have found some really
exciting stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really interesting to me is
that the story that these farms are
[SPEAKER_01]: telling, and they're really focused on
growing food and growing it in a good way,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not that different than what we see in
a rural place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't connected this very actively in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of these farms are really
hungry to interact with their rural
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues, to be learning the best
strategies, to be participating in those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of training programs, to be doing
the hard work of capturing their costs in
[SPEAKER_01]: a more active way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recognize that here I'm growing
lettuce or I'm growing microgreens.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this is dealing with the real food
insecurity issues that my community faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm going to do a business,
this is how I have to approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, it's being there and being
in that place and doing agriculture that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a huge impact on their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need are some ways in which we
can actually quantify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you actually quantify a change in
the land values of a community because of
[SPEAKER_01]: a farm that's come in there and taken
place and actually affected all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, neighborhood activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you put a price tag on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people trying right now to
understand how do you measure social
[SPEAKER_01]: impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you turn it into a number that we
can use to assess the actual broader
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of these types of activities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, as far as future
research, one of the things that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending to USDA is to think about how
they're investing in these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics and coming up with other ways to
complement the classic economic basis for
[SPEAKER_01]: which we evaluate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be taking the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA, once we're finished with our work,
we've been working with a group of 14
[SPEAKER_01]: advisors from around the country,
people that are real experts and deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: vested in urban agriculture, who have been
working with us to think about how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: tell this story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has fairly broad reaching
possibly impacts, particularly for
[SPEAKER_01]: planners and individuals that are sitting
in that role in city and urban governance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to do is once we're done
with this part of it and this work is
[SPEAKER_01]: published is that we will be doing
regional presentations of this and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating more regional dialogue and
conversations with planners as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: those activists, leading to a national
community of practice that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the activities for the next year
is to bring together those people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: either farming themselves, are currently
committed to try to figure out how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: make urban farms more successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do we connect that to other
individuals that are trying to really
[SPEAKER_01]: think about those broader social impacts
of the farm bill and think about what
[SPEAKER_01]: particular changes in USDA legislation?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we recraft or change the authority
of the rural development arm of USDA?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be rural and urban
agri-development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just changing the word or
dropping the word that allows grants and
[SPEAKER_01]: funds to be used and deployed in urban
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of our intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of what Molly said, that there's
very few controlled environment ag
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fully contained and no vertical
farms were included in this completely
[SPEAKER_01]: contained LEP based farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working right now with the
Association of Vertical Farming and Neil
[SPEAKER_01]: and a couple of others to try to actually
add more cases based on that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: farming system to flesh this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately, we want to be able to
build a deeper ag, urban ag resource
[SPEAKER_01]: library to help planners as well as
farmers find the resources and
[SPEAKER_01]: connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often these folks, they are hunting and
pecking just like everybody else on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you actually distill urban ag
policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to write an urban ag policy
for having livestock, who's done the best
[SPEAKER_01]: job of considering the issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be able to take all of that
and distill it into a place that can serve
[SPEAKER_01]: as a resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maintain it with our colleagues to do
that going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was it.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, in terms of addressing
food security, it seems that the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional business model may not be
effective.
I mean, it seems that for urban
agriculture, it's really going to be
security.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to rely on government subsidies
or philanthropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: These farms have such a small footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never going to make a very big
impact on community security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is not the sort of goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, there's so much that happens just
with individual awareness and individual
[SPEAKER_01]: agency and self-efficacy around food and
access to production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the venue and the space
where urban ag really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it creates a split personality for an
urban farm because they're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: walking forth with this ban and we're
addressing food security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some might have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's the bottom line is
they're not producing anything that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: any real impact for their communities if
they really want to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we talk about it for what it really
is and then think about the complementary
[SPEAKER_01]: activities to amplify what it could do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just for an example, there's one farm
in Philadelphia that has a CSA,
[SPEAKER_02]: not really CSA, Farm Box program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a farm, but none of the food that
is going to that farm box program is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from the big farms in New
Jersey and Lancaster and everywhere else
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they can take a regional approach
and introduce people to the concept of
[SPEAKER_02]: regional agriculture through an urban
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually is a way they're
increasing the calorie crops that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a real impact on food
security there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's interesting programs in New York
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with senior centers now,
which they're doing CSA box type models.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're farming on rooftops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having those activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's complementary farms that are
making money that are actually trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not asking one operation to
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't ask rural farms to meet all of
these social goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can we allow urban farms to function
without that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Furthermore, why should we treat an urban
farm differently than we treat any
[SPEAKER_03]: business opening up in an urban area?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what you're saying is that they're
primarily profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're motivated like we'd like to think
every farmer should be, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should they get any subsidies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should we be developing any
educational resources?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were coming in to build refugee
communities or ways of bringing people up,
[SPEAKER_03]: then that's something we would all invest
in, I think, as a way to sort of grow our
[SPEAKER_03]: next generation population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I feel like they're asked to be
on a clear mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be a very clear social
mission that can be funded and supported
[SPEAKER_01]: with outcomes that are related to
education, training, or other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one sort of type of operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Brooklyn Grange, for example,
they split that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recognize that that takes so much
energy and a staff onto its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't do that in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by splitting it up, it allows them
actually to get back to the business of
[SPEAKER_01]: the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not lose sight of the opportunity
presented by being a farm in a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the elegant design that we want
to be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's examples like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of examples like that
that we don't think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really easy for us to
consider and really focus in on we can
[SPEAKER_01]: think of an urban farm as a community
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really different.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are farms that are not community
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some of them that feel like they
are that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lose vegetables to two-legged
predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really are about people trying to
make a living in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're running way over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to suggest that for anyone who
would like to chat with Anu and Molly,
[SPEAKER_04]: they will presumably stay in front for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can come talk to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you both so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
