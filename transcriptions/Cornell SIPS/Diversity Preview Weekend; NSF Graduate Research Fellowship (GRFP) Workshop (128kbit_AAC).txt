[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for bearing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a quick overview of where
we're going to be going in about the next
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start off talking a little bit
about fellowships and grants, what they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, why we care about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously from our title,
this workshop is specifically about one
[SPEAKER_01]: fellowship, and that's the GRFP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start out by talking about some
of the eligibility and the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with this, and then we'll kind
of walk you through what it's like to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply, starting off kind of big picture
from contacting faculty and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: developing your project, and then we'll go
into some of the more nitty-gritty details
[SPEAKER_01]: about how that all works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit about us and why
we're talking to you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Kate.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience with the GRFP is that I
applied once while I was applying to grad
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I reapplied during my first year
at Cornell and I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second proposal that I wrote when
we got the fellowship is actually for a
[SPEAKER_01]: project that I'm still working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is, I'd say, maybe uncommon,
and lots of people change their research a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot after writing the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they do get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my name is Lauren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also applied to the NSF GRP during my
application to grad school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was not funded, but it was a great
way for me to work with my advisor and
[SPEAKER_02]: work on a project together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still working on that similar
project through a different funding source
[SPEAKER_02]: in that lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please interrupt us at any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scholarships, fellowships, grants,
what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this language kind of gets funny
because different programs will refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the same types of funding
opportunities with different language.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, I think of a scholarship
as something that's just paying your
[SPEAKER_01]: tuition to help you go to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fellowships are something that I generally
think of as paying your salary or paying
[SPEAKER_01]: you a stipend while you're in school,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then grants might do that as well,
or they might be more for research
[SPEAKER_01]: funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we talk a lot about fellowships is
that they're one way to help you stand out
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're applying to grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely possible that applying
just increases your chances of being
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted because you stand out that you're
pursuing this source of funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then life with funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding is easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you come into a program with your
own funding, it means that you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: will spend less of your time teaching,
have more time for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, having your own funding
will mean that you can do the research
[SPEAKER_01]: that you really want to do and you'll be
less tied to like your supervisor's grant
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Lauren kind of hinted at,
this is also just great writing practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going through the application process,
you'll really have to think deeply about
[SPEAKER_01]: your ideas and what you really want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just like an awesome thing to
do and will help you out even if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: end up getting funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this workshop, we're obviously
talking specifically about the GRP,
[SPEAKER_01]: which stands for the National Science
Fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys still hear me like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a little wardrobe
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, in this workshop, we're going to
talk specifically about the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Science Foundation, the Graduate Research
Fellowship Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about 2,000 awards per year
across all of the STEM fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: The award provides three years of stipend
at about 34 grand a year, and that amount
[SPEAKER_01]: does go up over time to adjust for
inflation and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also provides tuition support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also just going to say,
I forgot to say this before, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be sending you all of these slides in
addition to a bunch of extra resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't stress about like writing stuff
down right now if you're welcome to pick
[SPEAKER_01]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send all of this to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, okay, in addition with the GRP,
there are kind of these extra bonus
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities that you can get with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those include these opportunities
to do government internships like with a
[SPEAKER_01]: federal agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of some cool extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the GRP, one thing to keep in mind
is that it's possible to make yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive and get into this kind of zone
of contention where you're one of the top
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants, but then it's kind of a
lottery within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is our general timeline
overview of how the GRP works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the exact dates for the 2018
award competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the application will be due at the end
of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for some reason, they give your
reference letter writers about an extra
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your letters will be due.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, woohoo, you submitted your
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you feel awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to go on to finish
your grad apps and interview throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear back from schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll hear back from the GRP before
the decision deadline where you decide if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go to grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the dates might change a little bit
for the GRP, but it's generally kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: along this timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, please raise your hand to ask
questions at any point or just shout them
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm just going to repeat that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was about how does kind of
applying for the grant end up helping your
[SPEAKER_01]: grad school application?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think you're right that just
seeing that you're applying, that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make that happen is something
that schools like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, typically, when you apply,
you may contact a PI that you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in joining their lab and talk
to them about your project idea because
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll end up proposing something that's
very specific that could be directed at a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also a way of showing that
you're really interested in a place and
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help your application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eligibility and rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're eligible to apply for the GRP.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply as many times as you like
before you start grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can apply when you're a senior,
an undergrad, any time before you've
[SPEAKER_01]: started grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a year or two off,
you can keep applying during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you're in a program,
graduate students are limited to one
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be either during first year
or the second year of graduate school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, if you don't have US
citizenship, national or from the
[SPEAKER_01]: residence status at the application,
you won't be eligible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also become ineligible if you've
completed your grad or professional degree
[SPEAKER_01]: by August 1st of the year of the
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are exceptions to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely not an expert about GRP
eligibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have questions, definitely come
ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And likely what will happen is we can put
you in touch with someone who is super
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: At most schools, there is someone who will
kind of be the person who oversees all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the GRP recipients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like a really good source of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've submitted your application at the
end of October again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woohoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a panel with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the panelists at this stage come from
broad areas of related research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in ecology and evolutionary
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my panel would probably either be
ecology or evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're super broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I study plant-pollinator interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people who read my application
could study a whole range of topics within
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology or evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those panelists really might not be
super knowledgeable or well-versed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: technicalities of your discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to keep in mind as
you're writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the review criteria include these
two big pieces that we'll talk about more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those include intellectual merit and
broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So intellectual merit is basically this
idea that your work should have the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to advance knowledge either
across or within fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be some kind of novel
aspect to what you're proposing that will
[SPEAKER_01]: advance science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then broader impacts are this idea
that NSF wants the work to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to benefit society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be the research itself,
like if you work on something that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of applications to agriculture or
fighting diseases or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also you can also have broader
impacts through activities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: related to or supported by the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are involved in some kind of
scientific outreach program where you
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with the public, that's a great
way to have broader impacts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to add to intellectual
merit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Kate said before, it's somewhat
unusual to work on the exact project you
[SPEAKER_02]: propose to be NSF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this application, they don't ask
you for like a budget for your project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really propose almost anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like don't propose a Mars mission or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go a little bit bigger than you
think might be feasible for a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like something that might not be exactly
what you're going to do but really fits
[SPEAKER_02]: into intellectual merit and shows that you
know how to do some science experiments
[SPEAKER_02]: and has some broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, kind of like the vein of your field
is not going too big, but you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be limited as much as you would with
some other applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the animal, are they looking or
why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because are they great for you on a
certain percentage of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual and broader impacts would be
so that whoever of these 2,000 people will
[SPEAKER_00]: get it, it's like, okay, well,
this board, okay, she's got a 30% broader,
[SPEAKER_00]: but her intellectual is like 60% though,
right now she's 60 to 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take those top percentage of the
2,000, but okay, well, anybody over the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, they get the funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to kind of get not one
versus the other, but a good thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: both to raise you up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about how exactly
intellectual merit and broader impacts are
[SPEAKER_01]: scored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the answer is definitely that
you need both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if one of them is super high and one of
them the reviewers think really isn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: great, you won't just get the fellowship
because you have great intellectual merit
[SPEAKER_01]: or great broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need really to have both of them be
well developed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's just a little bit more again
about what makes a successful application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been talking about intellectual
merit and broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The panelists really like to see creative
original or transformative concepts,
[SPEAKER_01]: which just even saying that made me
nervous because oh my gosh, like how are
[SPEAKER_01]: we supposed to be doing that at the
beginning of our careers, but you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just take time to really think about
what would push your field and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: propose something that you feel like would
be cool to see that maybe hasn't been done
[SPEAKER_01]: before in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really like to see well reasoned with
an organized basis for activity and a way
[SPEAKER_01]: of assessing success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we'll talk about this more
later, but that comes from having clear
[SPEAKER_01]: hypotheses that you can test with your
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really like to see it a focused
project that is clear and it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do it and you'll really learn
something from doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing that matters are the
qualifications of the individual and the
[SPEAKER_01]: organization for the activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be tricky if you're proposing to
move into an area of research that you
[SPEAKER_01]: really haven't worked in before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps with this to kind of play to
your strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've already worked with this kind of
system before, so that will help me do
[SPEAKER_01]: this project or the lab that I'm joining
has worked in this system for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will help me do this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of building off of that,
they're also looking for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have adequate resources and support
at an institution or career collaboration?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, like, does it make sense that
you can do the project based on who else
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with and what they have
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a question I was going to
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to actually be
affiliated with an institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you're working with the
state or county department of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, if you were working closely
with them and they were helping monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: your research and getting catalog with
them, you could technically still apply
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is kind of about like who
your collaborators can be and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're not necessarily always working
with an academic institution, can that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work towards this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so being affiliated with an
institution is sort of essential on some
[SPEAKER_01]: level because you are applying to go to
grad school and getting a PhD,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, typically involves being
affiliated with the university,
[SPEAKER_01]: although there are some programs that will
be joined with like conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, you want to stress that
you're going to be in a certain lab or in
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain graduate program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you know that you have those
connections to state agencies or
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation groups or something like that
already, that can be really great to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wouldn't rely solely on non
academic collaborations or connections.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, how specific should
your connection be to a specific lab or
[SPEAKER_01]: program since you're going to apply before
you apply to grad school?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is pretty specific,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will write this proposal as if you
have decided and you are going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with a specific professor at a specific
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't end up doing that,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just kind of pretend in some ways
that that's what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also could be the case that as
you're applying, you say, oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with this person at this place to do
this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may even be sharing that
application with other PIs who are not the
[SPEAKER_01]: person that you name, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of want that placeholder in
to show that you have something really
[SPEAKER_01]: specific in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I say to Ash that when I was
applying, I reached out to a professor
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wanted to work with and said that
this is kind of my interest area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have projects like this,
or can we do something together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had some ideas and we worked
together to, I wrote a book, I sent him
[SPEAKER_00]: drafts, and we would go back and forth on
this proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote one of the reference letters
for this that we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very much working with him
throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you're applying to multiple
schools and would be therefore doing
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially totally different projects
within the same area, obviously?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you get this funding,
but you do not get it from that graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: school, it's not that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, obviously,
I'm telling you to be specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pick one person, one program that
you're tailoring your application to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if that's not where you go or
you don't get in there or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one holds you to what you write in
your GRFP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into this a little bit more,
but part of the GRFP is kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how well you can develop a project
and write about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how confident the panelists are that
you can do science on this level as an
[SPEAKER_01]: early stage grad student.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, whether or not you actually
pursue that project, it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: matter one way or the other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about how early to
start contacting people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to hold off on answering
that because we are going to get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other questions about kind of this
stuff, like a very big picture of how the
[SPEAKER_01]: application is reviewed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does someone have a hand up over here
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: We could.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to actually say about which,
just to make it totally clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: the NSF funding follows you anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's tied to, not to an institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take it because that's totally
clear.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So holistic review.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: This slide is going to be a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all about the timeline that we
just had that great question about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, given this timeline that
we've already outlined for the GRFP,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you're going to want to start coming
up with your ideas for projects in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and early fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really getting into the
writing, contacting professors is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you want to start kind of
before the school year starts in
[SPEAKER_01]: September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like mid-August, I think, is often a
really great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it super early, it's possible
that people are doing field work or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just kind of not on email fully
and you might get lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it too late, people are already
super busy with the semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've started thinking about your
ideas, you want to contact potential PIs
[SPEAKER_01]: with a written project idea and then let
them know or as you would talk back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth more, then later you're going to
want to follow up with a full draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, would you put this
question about the GRFP right in your
[SPEAKER_01]: first full draft?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great early on to say,
hey, you know, this is who I am and what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're attaching your CV to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also say, and I'm working
on a GRFP application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is that something that I can talk to
you more about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're starting, this process,
we want to highlight the resources that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have professors that you can talk
to, both maybe your current professors if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still in school or the professors
that you had when you were an undergrad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk to graduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are all here to help either this
fall or in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also talk to the grad students at
some of the institutions that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to or that you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask people in the labs that you're
interested in, hey, did you apply for the
[SPEAKER_01]: GRFP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you maybe be willing to look at my
materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's lots of other sources for
writing support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you who are still in
school, I know a lot of schools have like
[SPEAKER_01]: writing centers that you can go to and
bring, you know, drafts of your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can be great for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, at the bottom of this slide,
it's okay to ask someone to read the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I can't stress
enough to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you have to work on this
in a vacuum by yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should get as many people as you can
to read your work and give you feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to end up being your work
at the end of the day, but putting
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself out there to get feedback is
really going to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other questions up to that
point?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then we'll keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about some of the
details of the proposal itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this, you need to have two
statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is a research statement, and this is
two pages, which is not a lot of space to
[SPEAKER_02]: say everything you need to say about a
research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a personal statement,
and you have three pages for that where
[SPEAKER_02]: you talk about relevant backgrounds and
your future goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these statements are presented to your
viewers in the same packet, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: should be kind of related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, if you love dolphins,
don't talk about microbes in your personal
[SPEAKER_02]: statement, and like dolphins in your
research statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have some cohesive flow between them,
and we're going to talk about a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, how much is the
research you've already done weigh into
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not you're being accepted for
this fellowship?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it certainly helps to say that you
have this experience, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, you'll be able to talk about it
in a little bit more comfortable way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll kind of know some of the
language and know some of the techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be learning something new to
write this proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think also, you'll be able to
demonstrate that you're also capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might just sound a lot more feasible to
the reviewers if that is what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: proposing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can talk about that also in your
personal statement, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be something that you can talk
about the research you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it certainly is a part of it that
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll just jump in and say,
I think that for getting the GRP in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of what you propose, there's probably some
kind of speed spot, kind of range,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you've totally done the same kind
of project before, and you're building off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, that can be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've done things in a similar area
that aren't exactly the same, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of some shared skills, I think that
works really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a little bit more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would propose something that's super,
super general and heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never took a class in undergrad
where I did PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a true story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just think of that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be aware that obviously,
you're doing some jumps, and that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to grad school to learn new
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, single-spaced or
double-spaced?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are single-spaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to go over some of the
little formatting rules later,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any more questions?
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and speaking of the personal
statement, the next workshop, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: reviewing personal statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be some great time soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the other part of your
application are three recommendation
[SPEAKER_02]: letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should be some from people who
know your motivations and who you can
[SPEAKER_02]: trust to write a really excellent letter
about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really helpful thing to come from
different points or different aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: your life in undergrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, maybe a professor you
worked for, or someone who's your advisor,
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe someone who is in a
non-research-related job that you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, my reference letters were
two professors, and I worked in a tutoring
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was the director of the tutoring
center there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also want to make sure they can
all speak to your ability to do graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of this is helping them do
that, because they're probably writing
[SPEAKER_02]: letters for quite a few students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to share with them your CV,
share with them the statements you're
[SPEAKER_02]: sending to the NSF, and also share any
review criteria or things you want them to
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it really easy for them to write an
excellent letter and say, this is what the
[SPEAKER_02]: NSF wants to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some things that I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please put this into a nice letter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally fine to ask for that and give
them that guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the comment was writing a skeleton
letter for your advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think depending on your relationship
with your advisor, maybe having sentences
[SPEAKER_02]: for them might be a bit too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would certainly at least bullet
points like, here's the criteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: here's my CV, and if you could please make
sure you talk about this experience that
[SPEAKER_02]: was by no means stepping on their toes or
maybe making them feel a little bit too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it depends on how you know
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we've been talking a lot
about these, and we're going to send you
[SPEAKER_02]: about five examples of ones that were
successful applications for graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's four of them that are from
EEB, and those are the first four titles,
[SPEAKER_02]: and two of them are from SIPs,
and those are the last two titles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to send you unsuccessful
ones, too, so you can read them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just one thing to keep in mind
while reading these, these were all from
[SPEAKER_02]: different years, so some formatting and
some other rules might have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see something on the NSF website
that says, do this, and you see something
[SPEAKER_02]: else in the statement, follow what's on
the NSF website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look to these as an example that you
must follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all really great because they
deal with presenting intellectual merit
[SPEAKER_02]: and broader impacts in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have in their research and
personal statement, you know, a bold title
[SPEAKER_02]: of intellectual merit and a bold title of
broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others are more integrated throughout,
so you can see a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of how people kind of tackle
this, and yeah, they're really great to
[SPEAKER_02]: read through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we mentioned earlier connecting the
research statement to the personal
[SPEAKER_02]: statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see in some of these how people
have done that, and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about that a little bit more, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'll also just jump in and say
that since we've compiled it, we've
[SPEAKER_01]: received even more applications from
private students that we'll share with
[SPEAKER_01]: you, including a bunch from entomology,
so we've done this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a question to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a question, someone else has a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is if you'll receive personal
statements, too, and the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have research of personal
statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, some grad students were only
willing to share one so you might have one
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's not a complete application,
but there are at least four more complete
[SPEAKER_02]: applications that we'll give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and then the really fun stuff,
the formatting rules, you have to follow
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, if you don't, for many grads,
for this application, others, if the rules
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't followed, they will not review your
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please take them seriously and don't be
like,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eight and a half by 11 paper of one
inch margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use Times New Roman or Latak
fonts, but you can use 10 point font for
[SPEAKER_02]: references and figure legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's single spaced,
and it's two pages maximum, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: including everything you want to put in
for the research statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two pages maximum, and that includes
everything you want to put in that
research statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, is it one experiment
or is it multiple experiments in one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, it's one experiment with a
couple of hypotheses or objectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, in one of the statements,
and some of these statements you'll see,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, working with
mycorrhizal fungi and it's characterizing
[SPEAKER_02]: different metabolites or something about
the genetic control of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same project of maybe two or
three hypothesis and objectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll jump in on that and say that I
think that that's a really tricky part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this application because you have so
little space, yet you want to show the
[SPEAKER_01]: analysts what I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do all these awesome things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the guidelines about how
much you need to try to tap in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of really varies, too,
with your subfield and the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: research that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I really think that the best
way to approach that is just you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting feedback from people because grad
students or professors that you talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a pretty good sense of,
hey, it feels like you're trying to pack
[SPEAKER_01]: too much in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of your kind of subprojects
aren't as well-developed as they could be
[SPEAKER_01]: versus like, oh, maybe you can add a
little bit more here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's kind of hard to
think of a hard and fast rule for how much
[SPEAKER_01]: research to try to pack in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something to be aware of if you
try to put your full dissertation into two
[SPEAKER_00]: pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so again, a formatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you take full advantage of
the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people will fill up the full two
pages for the research statement and the
[SPEAKER_02]: full three pages for the personal
statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, don't forget that you can
use things like bold or italic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe some people will put their main
hypotheses or objectives in bold just to
[SPEAKER_02]: draw the reader's attention to this is the
main idea of this paragraph and the main
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of the next paragraph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a certain citation style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the citation style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in nature or science papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many of you have used a citation
manager before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did in an undergrad, so I'm very happy
to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are unfamiliar with what a
citation manager is, it's three different
[SPEAKER_02]: softwares.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some free ones like Mendeley or
EndNote, I think are the two big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it is is you can upload various
papers you've read to this manager and
[SPEAKER_02]: then through Microsoft Word or whatever
WordPress that you're using, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: insert citations through there and then
it'll build a references list for you in
[SPEAKER_02]: the citation that you taught up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not going to talk about how to
use those here, but your library resource
[SPEAKER_02]: at your undergrad certainly know how to
use those and can definitely set you up
[SPEAKER_02]: with one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's certainly helpful both for this
and for the future to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: make a mistake in this citation style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can have figures or images in
this proposal and if you have a graphic or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that can save you four sentences
and what you try to explain, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget these panelists are
reading so many of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can have a nice figure,
a graph, it's going to make your stand out
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit too in all the words they're
reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, what's a good size for
a figure?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can have something that you can
fit into, probably like maybe one and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half inch by one and a half, use something
that fits small and you can't make it
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is if it's really going to
save you words since you need to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: caption too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the captions can be in 10 point font.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can save you a little bit of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often you don't need to necessarily
repeat everything that's in the graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, if you're showing a
graph of like plant growth to like
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen, you can say something broad
about the trend versus like specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: like these four plants had higher growth
per nitrogen input than these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can say something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm learning to look forward to
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can say something like there's a
differential plant growth based on
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen accumulation, figure one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a shorter sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at if you go to like a writing
center to some of this, they'll also be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to help figure out how to make the
most of that space that you're using in my
[SPEAKER_02]: figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really speaks to the fact
that having your figure can be great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to make sure that you're
doing it in a situation where you're like
[SPEAKER_01]: an event from having that figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's something where you can
have a small graph that really clarifies
[SPEAKER_01]: what an expectation looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an organism with some kind of,
you know, that's really cool looking and
[SPEAKER_01]: would be easier for your viewers to
understand and visualize from a photo,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a great use of a figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's going to be lots of other
things that you write about, but in this
[SPEAKER_00]: super short format, the figure is not
necessarily going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is how small the figure
can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about like axis legends of
those can go below 10 point font.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a good question to ask like
a GRRP contact person at your institution
[SPEAKER_01]: or another institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say in general, I don't
think if something in the figure is a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of text, I don't think that they go crazy
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say, again, this is a place
where giving feedback comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're showing your proposal to
different people, people who might vary in
[SPEAKER_01]: their eyesight, you'll get a sense of like
if something is too small and both will
[SPEAKER_00]: get cranky about looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so for the writing aspect,
again, you really do need to be specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stating your hypotheses and objectives
really clearly and how you will test them
[SPEAKER_02]: is really important in a research
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your broader impacts are also important,
and you want to relate those both in your
[SPEAKER_02]: personal statement and your research
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: By establishing a link through those,
we have a quick example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, in some of the proposals
that we'll share with you at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the research statement or maybe somewhere
in the middle of the research statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll say I will continue my long-standing
efforts of mentoring underrepresented
[SPEAKER_02]: students by involving students in summer
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through fellowships on this aspect of the
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're tying in different, if you've
done tutoring and want to bring that into
[SPEAKER_02]: your research statement, that's how you
would do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you'll see some examples of
those later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and there's a lot of resources to
help you out with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Kate said, we're sharing these
slides with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sharing a bunch of applications with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a lot of databases both at
Cornell, Michigan, and if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: scholars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NSF website has all of the guidelines
that we've kind of talked through and
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even more than we've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Twitter link too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget to ask your PIs,
other grads since you've worked with,
[SPEAKER_02]: other people applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, again, we're sharing all of the
documents we have as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there any help with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, okay, alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the question is how much longer
will the NSF have GRPs?
[SPEAKER_02]: We both hope a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when the funding cycle is,
but they're definitely having it this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, so the 2018 competition, I would say,
is almost certainly going to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019 will be a new program solicitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way it works is that typically like
in three year chunks, they kind of revise
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the application guidelines when
they put out those new solicitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they kind of put out additional
dates for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2019 is a little bit more unknown,
but I'd say 2018 is pretty likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope that this program will
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's been really successful and
it's hard to imagine them cutting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a different, it's staffed in a
different way from another program that
[SPEAKER_01]: they did cut that affects graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, I'm kind of hopeful
that this will stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess with that being said,
it's a great reason to apply this coming
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you think that you might be
interested, you know, don't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, the question is, if the program
were to be terminated in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you still get your three years of
funding?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a scary hypothetical that I
don't know for sure, but I imagine that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would still get the funding because so
the program that the NSF recently canceled
[SPEAKER_01]: that was another program for graduate
students is called the doctoral
[SPEAKER_01]: dissertation improvement grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that people who got those
before it was canceled, they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if they hadn't spent it all at the
point at which it was canceled,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's still available to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that they're pretty good about
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about a database for
other graduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there are other grants
that you can apply to before you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say that I know for sure,
but I think that there are resources out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and we will ask around and try to
find those for you also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my department maintains a list of
grants and fellowships, but the vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of those are for students who are
already in a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the GRFP at this point is a
little bit special in this respect,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you can apply for as an incoming
student.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EPA used to have a similar fellowship.
[SPEAKER_01]: That program has been discontinued.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about DOE, Department of
Energy, if they have anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the DOE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for the USDA, it's all after once
you're in a program, there aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-programs through the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a great question and we can
look into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys mentioned the two aspects,
one of them was concerning how your
[SPEAKER_00]: research betters science.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your research is, if you're doing
research for the sake of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: or for the sake of science, would that
still be considered to be a whole farther
and higher education?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to be okay, be like, I'm doing this
for the sake of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about what if you're
applying and your research is more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic research level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talk about basic research where
the goals are really generating new
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge versus like applied research
where you're solving some kind of problem
[SPEAKER_01]: like a disease or something in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a basic researcher, so I
understand this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for that, I would say that my
broader impacts really focus more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of outreach activities that I would
do kind of outside of and in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: my real science research project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me that was talking about doing
outreach activities at the high school in
[SPEAKER_01]: the rural area where I do my field work
and being involved in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different mentorship programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, with the broader impact,
and I think you'll get a better sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: this from reading people's statements,
but you can really have things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like lab experiments or field work that
will count towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of these other activities
that we do as scientists that count
[SPEAKER_01]: towards that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to add to that, so I work in a
very applied field and the NSFGRP tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: steer more towards basic science
proposals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to see a hypothesis that
you're testing and how you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a lot of this stuff we do,
like I kind of want to try this on a farm
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't really, even though it
does have a broad impact, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really cut it as the main core of the
research proposal for the GRFP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be some aspect of finding out
a genetic mechanism and then your broader
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts saying that through this genetic
mechanism maybe it could help plant
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for the research for the broader
impacts, it can be more side note-esque,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for the other outreach components like
Kate was talking about, that can't be a
[SPEAKER_02]: side note.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be a more of a central part of
your broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll add to that and say that I
think NSF is really looking to fund people
[SPEAKER_01]: who they think are not only going to be
great scientists, but also great members
[SPEAKER_01]: of the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really want to know that you're
actually going to help mentor people or do
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of outreach program or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They read a lot of these and they think
they're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And building off of that too, especially
if you talk about an outreach activity
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've already done and building off
of that, that sounds a lot more powerful
[SPEAKER_02]: and something that you can do versus if
you've never done a certain outreach
[SPEAKER_02]: activity before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still mention it, but certainly
play to what you've already done and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you can seek to and build on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I go to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that that is a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question comment is kind of if you
are a basic researcher, maybe it's better
[SPEAKER_01]: to steer your impact towards the outreach
activities you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing more applied research,
maybe it's not going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is true to a large extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do basic research and then you try
to grow in a broader impact about how your
[SPEAKER_01]: work will relate to climate change,
that's something that people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: seek for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like, okay, we all know that the
actual point of this isn't to help
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation in the face of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to be careful about
staying true to the actual goals of your
[SPEAKER_01]: research and if your research doesn't
naturally have applied connections,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say don't try to push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, show your broader impacts through
outreach activities and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and from the other side,
so if you have a more applied project,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like working on disease-resistant
cucumbers, if you don't have like trilanes
[SPEAKER_02]: on-farm, like how it's going to help
farmers, in your broader impact statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just talked about a very applied
project, but it's not part of your impact
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, kind of like keep that tailored
to how your, what sort of project you're
[SPEAKER_02]: proposing and make sure it's consistent
throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hear that your intellectual merit
should reflect how you are in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: your research, but the benefits should
reflect how you are as a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to, for example,
I want to use my placement to engage in
[SPEAKER_00]: science, so that's more, it shouldn't
necessarily be like, this is what my
[SPEAKER_00]: research is going to do to the world,
but this is what I can do with my research
[SPEAKER_00]: in tandem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the comment was kind of about like the
intellectual merit of being really more
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly about research and broader
impacts can be a lot more personal,
[SPEAKER_01]: human-side, human science and being a
scientist, and I think that's generally a
[SPEAKER_01]: great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gregory, did you want to go?
Yeah, I just wanted to, so there was a
question about external knowledge that's
applied this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that comment was reminding you
about a website you maybe heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday, Pathways to Science,
which is a great resource, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always going to be more field-specific
resources out there, so talking to grad
[SPEAKER_01]: students and professors can be another way
of finding those if you don't already know
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we're about out of time,
so thanks everyone for listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you come up with more questions at
any point, we'll both be around,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll make sure our emails are out there,
so feel free to keep the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
