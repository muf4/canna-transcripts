[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for staying to the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I can entertain you with the
final frontier, the clavibacter selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in this talk, I'll give you a
snippet of some of my dissertation
[SPEAKER_00]: research that has been unfolding over the
past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm currently a fourth year PhD
graduate student in Chris Marsh lab up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacterial canker of tomato is caused by
a gram positive pathogen called
[SPEAKER_00]: clavibacter michiganensis subspecies
michiganensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a seed-borne bacterial pathogen
that can spread in these greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: production facilities, like I'm showing,
through water dispersal, through
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical inoculation, and can cause a
lot of problems for growers across New
[SPEAKER_00]: York state and across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once this bacterium is inside of the
plant, it spreads through the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: system, colonizing the xylem tissue,
and in later stages of infection induces
[SPEAKER_00]: these stem cankers that you see up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well as causing unilateral wilts
and marginal leaf necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: During kind of later stages of infection
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the fruit, it can form these bird's eye
lesions that can reduce the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and also lead to economic loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pathogen is especially important
in New York because we're the number five
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of tomatoes in the USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these tomatoes go to fresh
market, so they need to be blemish free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't have these lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the work we're trying to do
is to support this industry in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, there is currently no known
qualitative resistance to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested in understanding
tolerance to this bacterial pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started by looking through the
literature and finding that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: published tolerant accessions of selenum
hypercites and selenum arcanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I began screening them with both wild
type and also a hypervirulent mutant of
[SPEAKER_00]: clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is, I won't be
able to see that, is the most susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: selenum lecopersicum cultivar mountain
fresh and also our most tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: accession, selenum arcanum 2157.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that the bacteria are
able to colonize the tolerant accession to
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty high density, albeit less than in
the most susceptible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is impeded in its ability to spread
through the vascular system vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with looking at kind of the vascular
stage of this disease, we're screening
[SPEAKER_00]: these fruit to see if they're tolerant to
the fruit portion of the infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so currently we have a lot of data for
two of the four accessions, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible selenum lecopersicum and also
selenum arcanum 2172, different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: one I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that these bird's
eye lesions form on all of the genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because in this slide
I showed you before, it was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptomatic in the vascular stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's able to form lesions on the
fruit in that asymptomatic species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has led us to some interesting
hypotheses and directions where I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: this work that I won't be able to show you
all the pictures I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at the host vascular
morphology and how that impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability for CMM to spread between xylem
vessels and also vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a mix of confocal
microscopy as well as scanning electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy to see the colonization
patterns of the bacteria and kind of focus
[SPEAKER_00]: in on individual xylem vessels and see how
the bacteria are able to aggregate within
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also interested in looking at how
the bacterium alters the host xylem
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem kind of system, environmental
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using sap metabolomics to try to
understand that both in the tolerant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the susceptible species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that work will be coming within the
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to acknowledge my
lab and everyone that has participated in
[SPEAKER_00]: this project and helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mary Jean Welser helped me with the
SEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't put up there, but I'd also
like to thank the Rick Tomato Genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: Resource Center and also USDA Grand in
Geneva for providing tomato germ plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have a couple seconds for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hypervirulence strain of
clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a knockout of an expansin-like
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a secreted expansin protein or
expansin-like protein that still the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular mechanism that is still unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
