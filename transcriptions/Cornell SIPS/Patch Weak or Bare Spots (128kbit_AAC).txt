[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to repair bare spots
in the lawn before weeds have a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: invade.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you need to do is prepare
the soil, get rid of existing vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are any weeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deeper you can work the soil,
the easier it's going to be for the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to penetrate and it will help the
plants withstand all kinds of stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: like drought and heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to fill in with
some kind of a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just chosen a top soil that I picked
up at the garden center and I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: included some compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost is a good way to help improve the
physical properties of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: can help retain moisture and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a compost pile at home
that you want to use, that's a good way to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed I've chosen is perennial
ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in full sun and it also has a
characteristic of quick germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is something that you're looking for
when you're trying to fill in a bare area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a small area like this,
I am just going to mix the grass seed
[SPEAKER_00]: right with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using a three to one ratio of the
soil mix to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, and then one more of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to firm the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you have good seed to soil
contact, it allows the seed to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And simply by firming the area like this,
you can reduce the establishment time by
[SPEAKER_00]: up to a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final step is to keep the
area watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it sopping wet,
just keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the seed or the seedlings
to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they've dried out, they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got good germination,
you can back off on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will encourage the roots to go
deeper.
