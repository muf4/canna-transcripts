[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you're thinking to yourself,
what can I do to avoid the living
[SPEAKER_00]: sculpture graveyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're in luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do is some basic advanced
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every living sculpture project needs some
planning that takes into account the
[SPEAKER_00]: following two principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, maintenance of the sculpture and two,
youth and community involvement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living sculpture is easy to create and
with a little time devoted to maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: it each week, it will be a terrific
addition to your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each type of living sculpture requires
unique forms of maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, sod sculptures need to be
watered each day for two weeks until the
[SPEAKER_00]: piece is established and then weekly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sod has grown in, they need to be
routinely trimmed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea to keep on hand the
basic supplies you need such as a garden
[SPEAKER_00]: hose and pruning shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second critical part of your project
planning will be to ensure youth and
[SPEAKER_00]: community involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you involve and engage
youth and community members in all stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of the project from planning and design to
creation and maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that people take care of what
they own and of what they love,
[SPEAKER_00]: including living sculpture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these two basic principles of
maintenance and youth and community
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement are taken into account in your
project, then there's no doubt your living
[SPEAKER_00]: sculpture will be a popular, thriving
place to hang out in your community for
[SPEAKER_00]: years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy!
