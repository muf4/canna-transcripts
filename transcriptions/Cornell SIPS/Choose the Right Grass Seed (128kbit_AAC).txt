[SPEAKER_00]: If you really don't want to do much for
your lawn, there's different grasses you
[SPEAKER_00]: should pick that take less care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to invest a fair amount
of energy in your lawn, then you pick
[SPEAKER_00]: different grasses that will require a
little more mowing, watering, and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to set your expectations and
then recognize what you're willing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four main grass species that we have,
Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: tall fescue, and the fine fescues,
Kentucky bluegrass is generally a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance grass than some of the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a higher nitrogen requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the disadvantages of Kentucky
bluegrass when you're seeding is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very slow to germinate from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perennial ryegrass needs full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It germinates quicker than any of the
other cool season grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for repairing a bare spot perennial
ryegrass, if you're in full sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that's going to give you
cover the quickest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tall fescue likes the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have some moderate shade
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the nice things about tall fescue,
it is the most heat and drought tolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: of our cool season grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't ever plan to water your
lawn or if your lawn is in full sun or
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps you have a sandy soil that doesn't
retain water, you may want to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got moderate shade or kind of
filtered shade in parts of your lawn where
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to have grass, fine fescues would
be the grass to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the cheap seed mixes will include
a big proportion, sometimes 90% of annual
[SPEAKER_01]: ryegrass rather than perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you've got perennial
ryegrass and not annual ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, avoid mixes where the
variety is not stated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that you need to put into it to
see an area is the same whether you use a
[SPEAKER_01]: good mix or a bad mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take the time and read the label and
make sure that you're getting the best
[SPEAKER_01]: value for your dollar.
