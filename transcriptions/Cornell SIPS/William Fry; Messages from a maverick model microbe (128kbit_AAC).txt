[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my title today is messages from a
maverick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Model microbe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I realized is how much I really
do enjoy plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning I was grateful that I had the
opportunity to think about this seminar
[SPEAKER_02]: and lecturing today and the set of other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the model microbe is
Phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to say also this photo,
which I've seen many, many, many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many places, without ever any attribution,
was from Vaughn James from my lab about
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that Phytophthora infestans is a
model microbe because self in commune and
[SPEAKER_02]: a third one in his very closest friends
have said so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says so in this publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sage advice, Ellen, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just tell you some of the reasons
why I cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'm an introvert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you who are introverts,
who's an introvert?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't give advice so easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard the famous joke about
introverts?
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you tell a Finnish extrovert from a
Finnish introvert?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Finnish extrovert looks at your shoes
instead of his.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be talking like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, my career timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did not have a special plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sort of happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to say, I have had no special
career goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nothing that I can say that
would provide any career goals to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have wanted to do is be a professor
in a small university.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the professor part right,
but I've never quite made it to a small
[SPEAKER_02]: university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of you, my first years in
graduate school were sort of tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure that I should be in my
pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was interesting to go through that
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I suspect that I'm not alone in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have subsequently come to just
absolutely really enjoy the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it just really, really exciting and
really a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have messages from five top three
infestants in three categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I'm not getting advice,
what I'm going to do is sort of relate
[SPEAKER_02]: some things that I've learned during the
last several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In these categories, first of all,
epidemiology and population genetics of
[SPEAKER_02]: phytophthora infestants, a short segment
on humanity, and a short section on
[SPEAKER_02]: host-pathogen interactions, where I think
I'm going to illustrate sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Maverick qualities of this organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I need to provide some context for all
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is me as a diligent graduate
student some years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're probably all thinking that I'm
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking very hard at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice also that I do have brown hair at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably thinking that maybe I was
thinking about phytophthora infestants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in graduate school,
I was essentially a lab rat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the greenhouse once a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got to the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my thesis actually was really very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I discovered a new enzyme that was typical
of pathogens of cyanogenic plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants produce cyanogenic glycosides
that give rise to HCN on infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: HCN is really quite toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out that many pathogens of
these plants produce an enzyme that
[SPEAKER_02]: converts hydrogen cyanide to formalin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really proud of that
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's another message here in this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that your audience really
matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out the audience for cyanogenic
work in plants is really small,
[SPEAKER_02]: as illustrated here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first pathology paper on HCN,
that must be 1981.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyanide tolerance since 1971 has had 15
citations.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first paper on phytophthora infestants
was in 1975.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 79 publications, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three or four in the last six months,
which is also impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most impressive paper, certainly with
HCN, that I published was in the archives
[SPEAKER_02]: of the biochemistry and biophysics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's had 90 citations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, nothing in the past three or four
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: My most highly cited paper on phytophthora
infestants is this one in 1994,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we described a pan-global
distribution of a single formalin agent,
[SPEAKER_02]: PNAS, with 437 citations and 20 in the
last seven months, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the message here, there was no audience
for my really excellent work in
[SPEAKER_02]: cyanogenesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was an audience for work on
phytophthora infestants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say, this paper,
I thought it was sort of just a
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstration of the obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet it was picked up by a number of
readers.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hired to teach disease control
and do appropriate research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with my background in plant physiology
and biochemistry, that seemed like a
[SPEAKER_02]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't know what in the world I
would be going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought long and hard about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That position was actually here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I decided to do was to focus on
late blood for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it was a model for
epidemiology control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, it was important in New York
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was possible to do field
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was expertise in the department.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to credit Dave Thurston,
who was remarkably generous with advice
[SPEAKER_02]: and help during the early stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had been working with phytophthora
infestants for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was old at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was really very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the reason I chose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some epidemiology and population
genetics studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started work at Siegfried,
I would really have to do some field
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments in epidemiology and
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first field experiment occurred in
1972.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a total bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got drowned out from Hurricane Agnes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My second field experiment was of
Wielerman later in the same year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was absolutely no disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that this is not the
easiest pathogen in the world to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequently, I moved to Freeville and did
learn how to do field experiments with
[SPEAKER_02]: phytophthora infestants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an aerial photo of those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a false color infrared photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the healthy tissue looks bright red,
disease tissue gray, and soil is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were really significant
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really actually fun and
interesting to do these kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments because they were almost
analogous to doing enzyme assays in a test
[SPEAKER_02]: tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have ever done enzyme
assays in a test tube?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of us old folks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the kinetics were very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And disease development in one of these
plots had kinetics that one can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we knew about the epidemiology of
phytophthora infestants was really quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jack Bruhn in 1981 published a paper
describing a simulation model.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cartoon of it is listed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew enough to put this together
and it could be reasonably accurate,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, to run this model took hours
and hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the first time we did it was on
punch card.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took it to the mainframe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we used to do experiments over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd come back and we'd have a simulation
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do the same experiment today takes less
than a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jorge Andrada refined the model in
2005 and illustrated that it really works
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In these various epidemics, the
observations are in the open circles and
[SPEAKER_02]: the prediction is in the straight
continuous line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that the prediction fits
the observation pretty nicely in most of
[SPEAKER_02]: these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that model has been the basis for a
decision support system that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: subsequently produced here, this paper by
Ian Small from last year, in which we
[SPEAKER_02]: named and used the Blight Pro decision
support system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It involves host resistance, past weather,
future weather, fungicide, a pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, and pathogen proximity all
together in helping growers make
[SPEAKER_02]: management decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really important, I think,
is that all this is done in essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a very nice tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we didn't know at that time was what
caused unexpected disease control
[SPEAKER_02]: failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wondered about whether the
diversity in the pathogen population might
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we began a question looking at
population genetics of phytophthora
[SPEAKER_02]: infestations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we started, this is what was
known.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that there were A2 and A1 mating
types in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phytophthora infestations is
heterophallic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two mating types,
A1 and A2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only A1 mating types had been found
from the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two people coming to the lab where we
had wonderful tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Tully brought Alzheimer's to the lab,
followed by Steve Goodwin, who developed
[SPEAKER_02]: here RFLP fingerprint for DNA fingerprint
isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to this time, the only markers that
were available were mating type and
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no diversity in morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we only had mating type essentially a
single marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just couldn't tell anything about
populations of plant pathogens from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tools gave us this possibility of
looking at population structure of this
[SPEAKER_02]: organism in other locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we requested isolates from people
around the world, some were from culture
[SPEAKER_02]: collections, and analyzed those isolates
using both markers developed by Paul Tully
[SPEAKER_02]: and markers developed by Steve Goodwin.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Mexico, what we learned is that indeed
the A1 and A2 mating types were present in
[SPEAKER_02]: about equal proportions.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we applied Steve's DNA fingerprint to
these, what we learned is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: population was very diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this slide illustrates,
these numbers illustrate individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DNA is in this lens, covered with a
restriction enzyme, and then probed with
[SPEAKER_02]: RG57.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you'll see is that these
individual strains are really quite
[SPEAKER_02]: different from each other, which is
consistent with this being a sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: population in central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we learned from everywhere else was
something really dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the isolates from the US,
Canada, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia,
[SPEAKER_02]: the UK, Netherlands, Poland, Japan,
Taiwan, Philippines, Kenya, Uganda,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rwanda all had the same fingerprint,
which was a really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We turned this clonal lineage,
the US1 clonal lineage, because we saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: first in the US and then saw it everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all A1 mating type.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had one type of mitochondrial DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The allosomes were 100 and all had the
same DNA fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what was produced in this
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about the panoglutinous membrane
distribution of a single lineage of
[SPEAKER_02]: phytoxin investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you explain that kind of
situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can explain it for sure,
but one possibility is that this organism
[SPEAKER_02]: went through a severe bottleneck and went
somehow to Northwest Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Northwest Europe, there's a very
vibrant seed potato trade where seed
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes are sold all over the world to
South America, Africa, and Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this organism goes very happily into
our infected sea tubers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another possibility is that it came first
to the United States, and in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: it appeared in the United States before it
appeared in Europe, and then maybe from
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States it went to Europe,
and then subsequently was distributed
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've continued collecting isolates
from people around the world, and Linda
[SPEAKER_02]: Spielman made a really interesting
discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, look, there's something else
happening in these locations around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sure enough, there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we suggested is that there was a
second worldwide migration in the
[SPEAKER_02]: populations of those phytoxin investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some of the most exciting work
that I've ever been associated with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably is some of the most
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote a spectacular proposal to
investigate this, and it was trashed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like some of the most important
and most interesting projects just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reviewers really didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't believe that this could be
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made the news in the early 1990s.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an article from the New York
Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what actually happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 1970s, US1 was distributed
essentially all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: By 1997, those populations had been
replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't find it in most locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been replaced by a different
population of phytoxin investments,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is highly diverse in most locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, there's such a reproduction
occurring in the Scandinavian countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do know how that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a shipment of potatoes from
Mexico after the 1976 season, because in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, there had been a drought in 1976.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a very short potato crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Europeans decided to allow Mexican
potatoes into Europe so that they would be
[SPEAKER_02]: used exclusively for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't prevent people who buy potatoes
in the store from planting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what brought in these novel
strains of phytophthoric testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were subsequently
distributed around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have isolates in Netherlands,
Germany, and Poland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collected that in the arms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could demonstrate that there was
this introduction of these new strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they displaced the old strains that
had been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this message I get is that with
this organism, migration and population
[SPEAKER_02]: displacement are really huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't happen only in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also happened in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example that is particularly
impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this concerned a lineage that we've
called the US-8 clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We detected it in 1992.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it moved again across New England
and New York at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the season, we had a sample
from May, which also had that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have seen this strain before,
because we've sampled from Northwest
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico and found this exact same isolate
at present in Northwest Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 1994, it covered the entire,
eastern part of the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by 1995, it had colonized.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the western part of the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we've done is to
look at the population structure over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this slide prepared by Giovanni Donis
illustrates that US-8 was the dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: strain from 1997 to 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was replaced in 2009 by US-22.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say just a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see that after 2010,
that US-23 has become the dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this turns out to be really typical
for phytophilin testates, is that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are these waves of predominance and
disappearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's true not only in the US,
but also in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are data from David Cook,
who illustrates that the US-1 strains
[SPEAKER_02]: present in 1989 and the US-22 were gone by
1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these A-1 strains were present
until about 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting in 2005, there was dominance
by this strain here, which is called blue
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 or 13A2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that particular strain was also very
aggressive and has become dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the take home message concerning
epidemiology and population genetics to me
[SPEAKER_02]: is that all non-Mexican phytophthora
infestans populations are recently derived
[SPEAKER_02]: from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: This organism just goes in lots of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen reports where people have
suggested that we have an Irish strain of
[SPEAKER_02]: phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they don't say is it's only been
there for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And prior to that, it was in Mexico,
which is strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way that there's such a thing
as an Irish strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way that there's such a thing
as a US strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all recently derived from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my next topic is about humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I took this picture in early August
1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a potato farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a potato field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's brown because it was destroyed by
lake life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a sprayer right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that grower had been sprayed two or
three times a week to suppress lake life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I talked with a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is always difficult to say about
[SPEAKER_02]: what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, every Thursday night,
the growers in this county get here and
[SPEAKER_02]: they cry together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because they were unaccustomed
to the fact that this strain would exist
[SPEAKER_02]: in the middle axil and
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just were unaccustomed to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was sort of my first introduction
to the damage and human impact that this
[SPEAKER_02]: disease would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a picture of a Irish shepard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a grower in Madison County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 1994, he lost his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lost his crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are data he sent illustrating what
lake life did to him in 1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1995, he declared bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple years later, he died.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2009, a similar story happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Myers, in my life, took this picture
at our local Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took this picture on June 23rd.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are tomato transplants to be sold to
local gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are infected with phytophthora
pestilence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was what happened not
only in our Lowe's, but in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Pennsylvania, in Connecticut,
in Maine, all throughout the Northeast in
[SPEAKER_02]: the third week in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I visited this organic farm,
I think, toward the end of July in 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the last planting of
tomatoes, and they were being destroyed by
[SPEAKER_02]: lake life as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I received this letter, which I think,
well, I'll just read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an organic gardener in Amsterdam,
New York, with 63 arid tomato plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: 23 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing very rare varieties,
blacks, greens, oranges, whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll purchase from a very reputable grower
in Scoharie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, I have to leave home as my
husband, pulling back all 63 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 100% loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live on 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: I inspect it every day, and it seems the
black took my plants in a matter of hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: which obviously didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping to sell them for additional
income.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I chose lake life to work on as an
academic decision, because I was using a
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient system to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about all of this in the Irish
potato famine and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the experience is really quite
significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this site was given to me by Sanjoy
Gula Roy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an example of a 2014 lake life
epidemic in West Bengal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened there was that in 2013,
there was significant overproduction that
[SPEAKER_02]: led to low prices, and some growers could
not get their loans and pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2014, there was a devastating lake life
epidemic caused by 2013, the one we saw in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were terrible losses, economic and
social and farmer suicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Sanjoy is particularly
disappointed that the government,
[SPEAKER_02]: or he is, limited exports to other places
because that sort of destroyed future
[SPEAKER_02]: markets for the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my lesson that I've taken from this one
is that lake life is an equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next on to host pathogen
interactions is my third topic for
[SPEAKER_02]: message.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've labeled this one the Frye lab
failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're failures because we've been
unable to see phenotypes that other folks
[SPEAKER_02]: have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one concerns PR5 Osmitin,
which according to the PNAS article
[SPEAKER_02]: conferred resistance to lake life in
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we received, the developers of this
were happy to send us transgenic potatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: that were expressing PR5.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an experiment where we had
different potato genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, the plants with PR5
were not at all resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just completely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, we just could not
achieve the same result that the folks at
[SPEAKER_02]: Purdue had achieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a year or two later, I was in
conversation, email conversation with a
[SPEAKER_02]: colleague in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, I've created resistance to
lake life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were going to create transgenic
potatoes that were resistant to lake life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, we were able to do a
field test, which would confirm that
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of that field
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people in the room who were a
part of that experiment and remember it
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by this time, I've learned how to kill
plants with lake life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although the company would never come
across or convince that what happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: the construct had a pathogen specific
promoter with an R gene and an AAV R gene
[SPEAKER_02]: so that upon inoculation of the leaf with
phytophilic festans, we'd be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify a sense of response and effect
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what they saw in their
experiments in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just after we had inoculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we saw after the epidemic
had progressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out, there was indeed diversity in
the transgenics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some were more resistant, some were less.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing associated with the
transgenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I really learned from
this is that if you put potatoes through a
[SPEAKER_02]: palace, you would use a lot of semiformal
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that explains the diversity that
people see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do some people see these phenotypes
that we can't?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've wondered that for some years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just in the last couple of years,
I think, I think I actually know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the answer is that sporangia
from a culture are not the same as
[SPEAKER_02]: sporangia from a leaf or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people inoculate in the growth chamber
with sporangia that come from a culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And epidemic in the field, there's not a
lot of sporangia that come from culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all come from leaf or similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason I think I know this comes in
part with work from Eduardo was his
[SPEAKER_02]: approach was to his goal was to look at
how sensitive phytophthora and sporangia
[SPEAKER_02]: are to solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a terrible time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one unhappy graduate student for
the summer, because every time he did this
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment, you take the sporangia from
culture, you expose them to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was just absolutely no survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, in desperation, when he didn't
have a culture available, he took some
[SPEAKER_02]: sporangia from a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, they did survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: On cloudy conditions, they did survive for
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under sunny conditions, which is
illustrated here, most of them are dead
[SPEAKER_02]: within 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they survive 10 or 15 minutes in solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, the sporangia from this
culture, which don't survive at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: spangia from the leaf do survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really different from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the work with Dan Klecic, we had
another insight into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was working on arachidonic acid,
and where he demonstrated that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, if you treat plants with
arachidonic acid, they become more
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant to phytophthora testing,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's an image of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a leaflet that did not have
arachidonic acid applied to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see a nice lesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a leaflet that did have arachidonic
acid, and it was a very small lesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we tried to repeat that experiment,
and we didn't get the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized the reason we didn't
get that phenotype is that we were taking
[SPEAKER_02]: our sporangia from leaflets and
inoculating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take a sporangia from a leaflet
and you put it onto plants not treated
[SPEAKER_02]: with arachidonic acid, or treated with
arachidonic acid, you get no phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's the exact same pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: One comes from a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other comes from a culture plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions that Sean Pateef
was asking is, is there an effect of this
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogenicity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did a field experiment in which he
took sporangia from a culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: two different isolates, and inoculated
plants in the field and leaflets in
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that he did get disease,
different amounts of disease from the two
[SPEAKER_02]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he took sporangia from a leaflet,
both in the field plots and for both
[SPEAKER_02]: isolates, he got a lot more disease with
the same number of sporangia than he did
[SPEAKER_02]: if the isolates came from culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's particularly true with the
disease on leaflets in the moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our goal is to try to understand what
is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one approach is to use RNA-C to
determine, first of all, if the sporangia
[SPEAKER_02]: are different from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, to see what's happening
during the infection process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those materials are still a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in lieu of having the RNA-Seq data,
Sean did some quantitative real-time PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we know is that lymphoma,
which is an elicitin from tycophen
[SPEAKER_02]: testings, that's a protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can put it into tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that the elicitin is
down-regulated in planta.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an RxLR, which is an effector
from phytophen testings.
[SPEAKER_02]: From previous studies, we knew that one to
be up-regulated in tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did was to compare the
expression of these two genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In spreads that came from either leaves or
from culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was that, from culture,
Inf1, which causes hypersensitivity,
[SPEAKER_02]: was up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The RxLR, which is an effector,
was down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Sean did was to look at the ratio
of Inf1, or the expression of Inf1 to the
[SPEAKER_02]: expression of RxLR, between spreads that
came from culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or spreads that came from leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he found is that, for these two
isolates, there's about a 50-fold
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in expression of those two
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I suspect that that difference in
expression can cause a different phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're using a spread gene from culture
versus a spread gene from leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pathogen clearly is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the host?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, in different environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out, I think, that the host
also is different, depending on if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: grown inside or outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did this experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was last year, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2001 or 2002 or 2003, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chris was heavily involved in this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking at the differences in
resistance between two closely related
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato introgressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did find a QTL for resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was remarkable about this is
that, first of all, we could get fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: good gene expression without a whole lot
of noise, which was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used microtom, which is an old
technology now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the most interesting,
to me, discoveries for plants that were
[SPEAKER_02]: not inoculated, but just growing together,
what we found was that the top 34 of the
[SPEAKER_02]: top 200 most variable genes were all
defense-related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm wondering is, are they,
in fact, defense-related, or are they just
[SPEAKER_02]: perturbation-related?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just growing in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're exposed to all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the top six included catalase,
which is the first one, and then five PR
[SPEAKER_02]: genes, which were the most variable genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found significant differential
expression of genes in the two different
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that we were able to silence
two of about 32 that were upregulated in
[SPEAKER_02]: IL-62, but not in M82.
[SPEAKER_02]: M82 is the more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we silence those two,
it reduced the resistance in IL-62.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conclusion that I come to is that
field studies of gene expression are
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a huge amount of variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't always get a huge amount of
variance with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to suggest that if we
really are interested in the host
[SPEAKER_02]: parasite, in order to see what's happening
in the field, that it's a whole lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient to do this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the third message I have concerning
host pathogen interactions is that maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least for phytophthora testens and its
host, the interaction can't be specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, the three messages to me are
there's no such thing, except in southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico, of a native isolate of
phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Late blight can be absolutely brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results we get with it can be
specific to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a maverick microbe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of my good friends, Cindy
McNabb, developed this limerick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phytophthora infestens is freaky,
prototypical, also quite sneaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its maverick ways cause eyebrows to raise
and theories turn porous and leaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's textbook quintessential,
exemplary, so elemental.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it conforms to microbial
norms, a model that's quite providential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's eccentric and weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: A renegade has reappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts breaking rules, making us look
like fools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conclusive results disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: This microbe that's model and maverick,
exemplary and enigmatic, we must
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, learned by both, and
eccentric, yet paradigmatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to thank you, and also to
recognize this group of people through my
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have pictures of everybody that
I've worked with before this time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would like to leave Christmas in the
audience now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and my wife Barbara is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She works in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has been a good partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with that, I'll just quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there are any questions,
I'd be happy to try to address them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you found that things like sporangia or
post-plot resistance are variable in the
greenhouse person's field.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about in your modeling,
what's important, those parameters
estimated from greenhouse experiment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think actually the model does need to be
recalibrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've learned is that different
isolates have different parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most models were constructed on
the US long lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicability of those models is
really not known at this point to how
[SPEAKER_02]: useful they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we saw was sort of a
qualitative difference in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: field versus the greenhouse type of
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this model has been tested a lot in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that has helped us a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your take-home message, number one,
is that all the isolates that we know of
[SPEAKER_00]: today came from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're all moving about,
and we're getting these new epidemics with
[SPEAKER_00]: new genotypes, presumably you'd get
different mating types that move about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could get geographically
specific isolates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you think that's already
happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sexual population in
Scandinavian countries, and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Western Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether that will develop into
something dramatically different or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: In many places, it's still highly common,
dramatically common, just like it is in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of Africa is that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think India, Asia are that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: South America is that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mixture, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is sexual reproduction in that part
of the world, including the Scandinavian
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most other locations have clonal
lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they have the same one,
like this U-13, which is dominant in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, is now dominant in China and in
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a follow-up to that,
so for places where the populations are
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal, quarantine issues seem to be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get a diverse
population there unless you allow entry of
[SPEAKER_00]: new isolates, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this pathogen travels on potatoes
around the world, and it travels in the
[SPEAKER_02]: air around the world as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there is migration quite
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do these newly derived sexual lines in
Mexico, how do they interact with potatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: in Mexico?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see epidemics, or is this more of a
paradox?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, potatoes were not grown commercially
in potatoes until the 1950s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to that time, it was on wild
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, there's a hell of a lot of things
that are happening in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Mexico, there's one commercial potatoes
in Mexico in various locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Tuluca Valley, in central Mexico,
it doesn't, because there's such a diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: population, it doesn't, to look at any
single individual, doesn't make much
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But elsewhere, for example, USA,
we saw in the Los Mochis, very similar
[SPEAKER_02]: state, which causes tremendous problems
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious about the transgenic AVRR
gene potatoes that you saw kind of go
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that look like a typical disease,
or did you see signs of autoimmunity or
[SPEAKER_02]: any potential?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looked really typical like.
[SPEAKER_02]: These times, there was no thing associated
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is our best hope in the
future for control?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that look like in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jonathan, I was on the stage with
Jonathan Jones one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was saying that our genes are going to
be the very best thing since sliced bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got up before that and said they're
never going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's really cool is that if you
combine the effect of an R gene with a
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicide, that will make the R gene a lot
more durable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Simplot Company is doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have transgenic plants with R genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want those plants to receive a little
fungicide, because as Michael Milgram has
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstrated, if you suppress selection,
then you delay the demise of a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: R gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one way to do that is to use a small
amount of fungicide in addition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to be integrating
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to just give anybody a Geneva
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aves, your elders in Geneva have a
question?
They'll probably say no.
Actually, we don't have them.
Anybody else here?
Oh, please go ahead.
So I'm confused about the role of
diversity in the population.
Are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sexual recombination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creates new genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mutation is the source of that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that phytophthora changes a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in a single lineage,
there can be a whole bunch of diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: for effectors that are recognized by a
pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we do see is you do get
tremendous more genotypic diversity in a
[SPEAKER_02]: sexual population than in an asexual
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have highly clonal populations in
most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Bill, we want to recognize you.
And thank you again for really outstanding
work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
