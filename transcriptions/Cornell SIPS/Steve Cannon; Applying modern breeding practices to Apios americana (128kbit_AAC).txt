[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great pleasure for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say something about city planning
and game developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've forgotten those in the bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I went back to school in plant
biology in 2000, I did work as a city
[SPEAKER_00]: planner, which is its own sort of data
analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a software developer
developing Oregon Trail is the most widely
[SPEAKER_00]: known game from that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I spend most of my time in
front of the computer managing genomic and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic data within the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk, though, about a side
project that will use as a mix of old and
[SPEAKER_00]: new technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get there, though, I'm going to
say a little bit more about sort of my day
[SPEAKER_00]: job, my regular work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an outline of the talk is going to be a
brief description of the online databases
[SPEAKER_00]: and tools that my group develops,
and then talk about this new crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to develop, Apios Americana,
also known as potato bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a philosophical discussion,
a question that I often ask myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: why work on minor crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because truly, Apios Americana is a minor
crop, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people here have heard about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my USDA ARS group has the mission of
managing genetic data for soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: for peanut, and a lot of other legume
crops, things like red clover as a forage,
[SPEAKER_00]: or narrowleaf lupine, which is an
important seed crop in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigeon pea, chick pea, lentil,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly big project, a lot of data
to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the work of a lot of people in the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go through the names, but just to
emphasize that all I do is answer emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys actually do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the databases, this is peanut with a
lot of the phenotypic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in itself is interesting because
peanut is a tetraploid that is basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: human product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the tetraploid probably was
identified and selected by humans 5,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went through a bottleneck of a
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, tetraploid peanut now has a
lot of diversity, which is an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: biological question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of some gene expression
from different tissues in soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are four different lipoxygenase
genes that show different expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're in the same gene
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from peanut base.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to show USDA germplasm for a
red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are arachis species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the genus that contains peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different colors are different arachis
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the center of origin of peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another tool, this is at leguminfo.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: We maintain a database of gene trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically focusing on legume species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each different color is gene sequences
from a given species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is soybean, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this tree is to allow
people to sort of traverse across
[SPEAKER_00]: orthologs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say something is known about one of
these soybean genes, and you're working in
[SPEAKER_00]: pigeon pea, which perhaps is less well
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a first guess that the gene
in pigeon pea may have a similar function
[SPEAKER_00]: to the one in soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say one of the reasons I'm really
pleased for the invitation to talk here is
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of my longtime mentors are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Doyle probably got me first excited
about the legume family, which is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost the biggest plant family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff deals with a lot of stuff like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legume family spans about 20,000
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great morphological and biochemical
diversity, moral diversity, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very abbreviated phylogeny of
the legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're most familiar with basically a
species from one of the sub-families,
[SPEAKER_00]: the papillonoid sub-family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sub-family has a lot of species from
what are sometimes called the worm season
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, or the bean group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes soybean, spasiole spulgaris,
or common bean, a bunch of different vigna
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are calpian relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigeon pea, as well as a bunch of other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've highlighted here apios americana,
the potato bean that I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of basal in this worm season
legume group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these have sequenced genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put this question up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't try to answer it in the talk,
but it's something just to kind of hold in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this clay, does this family have
so very many plants that our neolithic
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors chose for domestication?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of those plants from that
clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two calpy varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's apios americana, potato bean,
soybean, pachyrosis, or jicama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group, sometimes called the cool
season legumes, has lentil, chickpea,
[SPEAKER_00]: pea, licorice, or grass pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's fava bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a wild relative of alfalfa,
called nidicago truncatula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now onto the second section of
the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apios americana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apios is native across most of eastern
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is growing on streamside in
central Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the harvested apios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how the tubers are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of neat characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein-rich tubers, relatively
high-yielding, flooding-tolerant,
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial, somewhat drought-tolerant,
and native across much of our growing
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one of the previous research
technicians with a nice specimen harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: from Iowa soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the beans look like are the pods,
flower, tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, stepping back to some of the early
ethnography, the earliest reference I've
[SPEAKER_00]: found is from Thomas Herriot, who was a
scientist and ethnographer who traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sir Walter Raleigh's 1585 expedition
to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote Openoak, which I guess is one of
the Native American names for apios.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kind of root of round form, some of the
bigness of walnuts, some far greater,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are found in moist and marish
grounds, growing many together,
[SPEAKER_00]: one by another, in ropes, or as though
they were fastened with a string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being boiled or saut√©ed, they are very
good meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ropes, you saw pictures of those
in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an underground stem called a stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar anatomy to peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cultivated potato forms its tuber at
the stolen end, whereas apios forms its
[SPEAKER_00]: tubers behind each node.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, 1759, Colonel James Smith,
who was held captive among the Delawares
[SPEAKER_00]: from 1755 to 1759.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a kind of rough brown
potatoes, which grew spontaneously and
[SPEAKER_00]: were followed by the, I don't even know
how to say this, tribal name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohinata.
[SPEAKER_00]: These potatoes, peeled and dipped in
raccoon's fat, taste nearly like our own
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are references to how Native
Americans used these in sort of their
[SPEAKER_00]: culinary traditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boiled, along with meat or corn,
roasted in hot ashes, maple sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: peeled and dried, and sometimes preserved
in maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stew cooked with fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, these give some clues about how this
crop might be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a review by Gretchen Beardsley,
1939, called The Ground Up, is used by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indians of Eastern North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is her concluding paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Harvard, 1895, believes that
cultivation by the Indians had no effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on the size or the quality of the tubers
and asserts that experiments by Gilmore
[SPEAKER_00]: and others to improve it were
unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He states further that it is of slow
growth and laborious together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stout, 1914, seems to share Harvard's
view, also claiming that experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to improve ground up failed to
increase the size or the numbers of
[SPEAKER_00]: tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would appear there, therefore,
that although the ground that served the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indians and the colonists well as a food
plant, it was not destined for any greater
[SPEAKER_00]: role.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has now fallen into almost total
disuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the challenges we
face, the slow growth and laborious
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more bit of ethnography.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have encountered this
book, Buffalo Bird Wormin's Garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, look it up online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful ethnography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interview that became a PhD
dissertation in 1911 of a Hadatsa Indian
[SPEAKER_00]: woman who was born in 1838 or 1839.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole dissertation is her telling
this interviewer about their gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, their cultivars, their
understanding of these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hadatsa are from the upper Missouri
River Valley, what's now kind of central
[SPEAKER_00]: North Dakota, pretty harsh environment,
below Devil's Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one of their gardens on the shores
of Devil's Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the book starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the creation myth of their tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, we Hadatsas believe that our
tribe once lived under the waters of
[SPEAKER_00]: Devil's Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some hunters discovered the root of a vine
growing downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In climbing it, they found themselves on
the surface of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others followed them until half the tribe
had escaped, but the vine broke under the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of a pregnant woman, leaving the
rest prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part of our tribe are therefore still
beneath the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this reference to water,
to a vine growing into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near their villages, the people made
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these, they planted ground beans
and wild potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's referring to two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: From seed brought with them from their
home under the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vegetables we do not now cultivate,
but we do gather them in the fall in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods along the Missouri, where they grow
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she has a footnote in this
chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, I do not know when my people
stopped planting ground beans and wild
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, but ground beans are hard to
dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people, anyway, like the new kind
of beans better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, she's talking about three
distinct plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wild potatoes, the ground beans,
and the new kind of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wild potatoes almost certainly are
Cerelea esculenta, or sometimes called
[SPEAKER_00]: prairie turnip, which is native in the
Dakotas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in the warm season legume group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forms a nutritious underground tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a woman with harvested wild
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ground beans has to be Apios
Americana, which grows actually on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shores of Devils Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge is she identifies as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difficulty of harvest, the earlier
reference to slow growth, competition from
[SPEAKER_00]: other fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food plants, in her case, the new kind of
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, loss of familiarity
and tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the plus side, there are a lot of
assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of phenotypic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some diversity in tuber size and
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: High protein, about 16% by dry weight,
which compares with Solana and potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decent yield, similar to sweet potato
for the better varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps more than a year in
refrigeration, or basically indefinitely
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very flooding tolerant, moderately
drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adapted across most of Eastern North
America, up into Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be grown commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Korea and Japan, apparently,
they've figured this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a plot in Korea, and here it is in
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it taste, and how does it cook?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require a lot of cooking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes very nice chips, because it
doesn't have reducing sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to the potato, but it's
somehow meatier, drier, more substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little earthier, sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, this is a South Indian
take on this from the student,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vikas, who worked on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further, it has some possible
nutraceutical benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little uncomfortable talking about
this, because this is not my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are respectable publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, investigating apios effect on
blood pressure and plasma liquids in rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive effects on both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genistein, which is in relatively
high quantities in apios, is investigated
[SPEAKER_00]: for anti-cancer effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, by no means, pioneered the new work on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was by Bill Blackmon and his
technician, Bertil Reynolds, in Louisiana
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collected a lot of accessions through
the southern US, grew them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated them in open crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of their evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the great phenotypic diversity in
tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he retired in, I think,
about 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work kind of hit a dead end.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend and mentor from undergraduate
days, Gautam Bhattacharya, who's here,
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted Bill Blackmon, I think,
six or seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another colleague from Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 53 accessions still
remaining from that early evaluation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were kind enough to send those
lines to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A graduate student of mine who started
about the same time as Acosta-Lancar
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted this as a PhD project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much everything you'll see from
this point is Vacasse's work, building on
[SPEAKER_00]: the pioneering work of Bill Blackmon and
sort of the motivation from Gautam.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done field trials and
phenotyping, genotyping of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've generated a genetic map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added some additional wild collected
accessions, as well as collections from
[SPEAKER_00]: the second Apios species in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the two publications from
CropScience, Evaluation of Phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: Variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Vacasse, Gautam, Bill Blackmon,
who's still active or retired in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is Vacasse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how happy Apios makes him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the genotypic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature scientific reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our field evaluations in
2012, which was a drought year in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apios did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the plants from that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields can be quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield on this is about a kilogram and
a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly don't all yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They yield that way, but they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotyping results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version of this is there's a lot
of diversity that is stable genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of variation by genotype that's not
significantly affected by G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: High repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, some of the above ground
traits are good predictors of the below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground traits, which is helpful because
phenotyping below ground is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can cluster the groups
phenotypically into roughly four groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a couple of high yielding
groups with varying distribution between
[SPEAKER_00]: the child tubers and the mother tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother tubers being where the above ground
plant is growing from in some poorer
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding varieties with smaller tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hierarchical clustering and some of the
below ground phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCA, where you get similar separation of
the same varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the better varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, if any of you would like to
take this to try it, I have 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one right down here is a 2155.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy to pass these along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a number of what we're calling
elite lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that I'm ready to call this
domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what we would like is determinate,
perhaps, dwarf plants that are much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're certainly improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're improved in the sense that when we
compare against wild harvested accessions,
[SPEAKER_00]: the child tuber size is at least five
times improved over the wild lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've looked at, including a wild line
from Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ongoing work, GWAS, pedigree analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do the evaluation, so we did
RNA-seq on all of the 53 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit to our surprise, the clustering we
get genotype from that RNA-seq data,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the genotype data, generally matches
the phenotype clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful because it's easier to
genotype than phenotype, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are most of the elites in this
room, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, we were able to infer a pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work from Blackman was all open
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recorded the maternal line,
but they didn't know what the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: parent was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can infer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we did RNA-seq on this population,
we can begin to do association analysis on
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression of the genes and can find
genes that predict basically child tuber
[SPEAKER_00]: size and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have initial markers for further
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A genetic map basically carried out in the
F1 on the maternal side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is compared with phaseolus vulgaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, you can see a good
correlation between the chromosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: phaseolus and the linkage groups in apios.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, kind of take home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of newer technologies have been
useful in developing these expression
[SPEAKER_00]: markers, identifying SNPs, developing a
genetic map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some early GWAS, pedigree analysis,
identifying structure, identifying parents
[SPEAKER_00]: to use for crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing with marker-assisted
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some candidate genes for
dwarfing and for shortening of the stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final take home is that there's a
lot of diversity to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is to basically find the
diversity and then not let that go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to make a lot of,
well, let's see, we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Blackman was able to make a lot of
initial progress just through conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic characterization based on the
RNA-seq data, we were able to identify new
[SPEAKER_00]: triploid populations, which I haven't
mentioned, but a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting sort of basic genomic biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can the tools help with for the
breeding tasks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, characterizing the germplasm,
developing maps, pedigree analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: association studies, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the challenges, I think apios does
have a lot of promise in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is nitrogen fixing, it's flooding
tolerant, drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these could be helpful in changing
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps in the fridge or in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes similar to a potato,
so perhaps not that difficult to introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: into cuisines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also distinct and it has some
possible health benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last section, I just want to raise
some sort of philosophical questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a big question is why work on
minor crops at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't need to convince people
here because most of the talks to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point have been on minor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still kind of nagged at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I tell myself is that most
crops are minor crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have perhaps thousands of species that
are used as crops and just a few big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you take kind of a long
perspective, even something like maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is undeniably one of the biggies,
that was domesticated starting perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 years ago by our neolithic
ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe they missed some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they didn't get all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe new techniques are going to help us
make rapid progress in some that are
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, although we like to think
that we're cutting edge, we hope that we
[SPEAKER_00]: will have descendants 100 years from now
or 1,000 or 10,000 years ago and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll thank us for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing devil's advocate, though,
if you look at the major crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: the top 20 by calorie from FAO stat,
here they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, rice, sugarcane, unfortunately,
maize, soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably, I guess we could live on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a deceiving list.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is meant by vegetables other
or fruits other?
[SPEAKER_00]: It hides a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even within a single crop like maize,
there's vast diversity that has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained and exploited and goes into
different market classes and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just focusing on the legumes that I know
better, soybean, groundnut, beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulses, other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge group of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the ones that I came up with from
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the brown color is the warm season
legumes of various beans, common bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: lino bean, runner bean, jack bean,
peppery bean, lots of different cow-pea
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives, cool season legumes,
chickpea, lentil, fava bean, pea,
[SPEAKER_00]: grass pea, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in black, some species from some of
the other branches of the legume
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so some hard-headed reasons,
I guess which implies that I will come
[SPEAKER_00]: later to some soft-headed reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minor crops have important niches in terms
of local adaptations, resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be easier to cook or harvest or
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may simply taste good or have
important roles in traditional diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess you could summarize that in
terms of resilience and niches,
[SPEAKER_00]: either agro-ecological or cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple years ago, there was a nice
story in Nature on what they called
[SPEAKER_00]: African Super-Vanishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here was that after introduction
of colonial introduced crops, there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a return to some of the native
African vegetables that grow well there
[SPEAKER_00]: and are important in local cuisines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This included the African nightshade,
amalo, amaranth, or preceded leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: cow-pea or leaves, sweet potato leaves,
pumpkin leaves, spider plant, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: grown here as an ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from our backyard
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have fava bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: an English shell pea, and grass pea and
some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pick any single crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has fascinating stories about
niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fava bean is very high in nitrogen fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nutritious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold-hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often grown as a winter crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tasty, important in cuisines of
the Middle East, China, Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pea is something that kids will actually
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an important nutritional niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass pea is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latherus sativus has a wide biotic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say more about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important in Italy, North Africa,
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biotic range, it's grown in central
India, for example, at the end of the rice
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season and residual moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tolerates both heavy wet soils and
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you eat it under starvation
conditions, and you eat lots of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will paralyze you, which isn't such a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Permanently, it'll paralyze the large
nerves in the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an important crop, but perhaps
deserves some attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important crop, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Italian grass pea, or
caesartia, festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love this, apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't read Italian, but I think this
basically says, we celebrate a humble
[SPEAKER_00]: legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something about there's a caesartia
soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important culturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a neighborhood garden that we in
Morocco then manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, soft-headed reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a reason people garden is so
that they can eat what they garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a way that we connect with
these other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just considerable beauty in
the diversity, in the form of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of intimacy, both in foods
and in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to be honest, that's why many of
us are here, even if we want to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of impact against climate change and
hunger and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that we feed our
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, potato bean, yes, I want to improve
it, but I've also become very fond of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organism itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way I connect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is growing wild in a ditch in
Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very pretty flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wall of beans and amaranth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably all of you are getting seed
catalogs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a word for it is beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also great fondness that people
have for cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, too, cowpea land races that are
maintained because people love them for
[SPEAKER_00]: their particular characteristics or an
Italian shell bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my technician, Scott, with a trophy
apios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right next to it, another accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're fascinated by what is the genetic
basis for such different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated to learn how to cook and
eat this new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found, for example, that sort of
following from the Indian traditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cook it with a flavorful fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried raccoon, but I think this
is maybe olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like vegetable bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go for a marketing angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put it on Brussels sprouts or
a salad or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it in a bison stew, which was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Indian dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated by the floral biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, a leaf cutter bee pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different floral morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why work on minor crops at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's nearly infinite depth to any
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological, historical, cultural,
spiritual, existential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say what I mean by that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next and last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to love every crop,
but there's reason to indulge and nurture
[SPEAKER_00]: fondness for some crops and allow some new
ones into focus or to maintain some that
[SPEAKER_00]: are difficult but potentially important or
important in particular niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our descendants in 10 or 1,000 or
10,000 years may thank us for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closing with two quotes, one from Carl
Sagan, who I think did much of his work
[SPEAKER_00]: here, to make an apple pie from scratch,
first you have to invent the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, from Thomas Jefferson,
the greatest service which can be rendered
[SPEAKER_00]: to any country is to add a useful plant to
its culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to take your questions and
comments.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Native Americans apparently did use the
bean seed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pod is kind of fibrous, so not so good
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is about the size of like a mung
bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly think that is a direction this
could be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a hugely valuable crop
because now you'd have a perennial bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think anyone has selected in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've found triploids geographically
very in distant locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northeast and Iowa, at least two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so short answer, we've identified at
least three that are clearly genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be something about APS that
is allowing this triploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have ideas about how that
could happen, I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably one thing that's allowing,
I'm assuming that these are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be possible because it's a
clonal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you have to have some process
that's generating these triploids at some
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was, if you leave the tubers
in the ground, do you then get plants
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant growing in the wild,
what happens in the next year from this
[SPEAKER_00]: population or this clone into the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the tubers will send up new
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more common that the terminal
tuber will send up the shoot, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense because it's a way for the
clone to gradually grow and colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: New areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you'd have to look at things
like
[SPEAKER_04]: canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, two species in North
America of APS, APS priciana and americana
[SPEAKER_00]: priciana, forms a root tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americana forms the stolen tuber,
which I think is its self-fascinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: to completely different anatomies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two species are separated not by
that far from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing maybe five million years to
the common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an opportunity for some basic
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the basis for those two different
anatomical forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another, I think, interesting question is,
what is the genetic control of this
[SPEAKER_00]: beads on a string form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you stop that, as was done for wild
salamander and potato to make the terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: end tuber?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get some basic new plant biology
knowledge as well as something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on the perspective from
which you look at this cross and the loss
[SPEAKER_04]: graphs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the U.S., we have one situation
where the U.S.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: has the migration of the mid-Beltzmanns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And increasing flooding situations in
Carolinas, this coast, where the soy crop
[SPEAKER_04]: or the corn crop didn't bite down.
[SPEAKER_04]: This sort of crop, in those globalized
situations, can be a crop that is hopped
[SPEAKER_04]: down by routine swamps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the harvest issues and things like
might be important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a contradiction between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to repeat that for people online,
the point that the flooding tolerance is
[SPEAKER_00]: an important niche, and there may be some
unexplored niches like using this for
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting swine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them do the difficult harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, perhaps niches to be exploited by
you plant entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
