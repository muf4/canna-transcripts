[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Jenny said, my name is Megan Williams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, I will be discussing our work
on investigating the nitrogen management
[SPEAKER_03]: and alfalfa variety performance in a
dual-use kerns of alfalfa intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start out by breaking this title
down into its components to help us better
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the why and the how of this
study, starting with perennial crops and
[SPEAKER_03]: their benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, some stats.
[SPEAKER_03]: The agricultural sector accounts for more
than one-third of all global greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: gas emissions, with around 11% of those
emissions coming from synthetic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers, including its manufacturing,
transportation, application, and
[SPEAKER_03]: post-application soil emissions,
which makes synthetic nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: account for around 2% of global animal
greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are the
main source of nitrogen in conventional
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, and wheat is one of its top
users as one of the top three crops in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, covering around 1.5% of the Earth's
land area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perennial grains have been identified as a
potential sustainable alternative to
[SPEAKER_03]: annual grains like wheat due to their
wide-ranging benefits, which include soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health benefits from increased
below-ground biomass inputs, improved
[SPEAKER_03]: water infiltration and access,
carbon sequestration, and lower overall
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon emissions with their year-to-year
longevity allowing for reduced tillage and
[SPEAKER_03]: for fewer tractor passes per second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we can see a side-by-side comparison
of the root profiles of annual wheat here
[SPEAKER_03]: on the right and a perennial grain crop
known as intermediate wheatgrass here on
[SPEAKER_03]: the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: These deep roots are what are largely
responsible for the improvements to soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, let's dive deeper into intermediate
wheatgrass as a perennial grain crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: also known as pernza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a disclaimer, pernza is technically
just a trade name for a specific cultivar
[SPEAKER_03]: of the grain product of intermediate
wheatgrass, but because pernza is a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: easier to say than intermediate
wheatgrass, and because we did use that
[SPEAKER_03]: specific cultivar in our work,
I'll just be saying pernza for the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: our presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while initially cultivated in the US as
a forage crop, intermediate wheatgrass was
[SPEAKER_03]: selected for development as a perennial
grain species over other perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: grasses, forage traits that include high
grain yield and size, as well as grain
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities like nutrition and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: The intermediate wheatgrass cultivar known
as Minnesota Clearwater became the first
[SPEAKER_03]: perennial grain commercially available
under the trade name pernza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pernza grain has been used to make a wide
range of products including beer,
[SPEAKER_03]: flour, pasta, cereal, and more,
and I personally can't endorse the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, despite pernza being selected for
development as a perennial grain,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are still reasons why pernza is not
yet a household name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite successful breeding efforts to
increase its grain size, pernza grain is
[SPEAKER_03]: still about one third the size of
commercial annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been estimated that it'll take
another 24 breeding cycles to get pernza
[SPEAKER_03]: grain size up to par with wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, pernza grain yields
consistently do decline over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this graph from Lovatelli et al.,
we see two different populations of
[SPEAKER_03]: intermediate wheatgrass, both
significantly declining in grain yield
[SPEAKER_03]: from year one to year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: This grain yield decline makes farmers
less likely to want to maintain a pernza
[SPEAKER_03]: stand for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thus negating some of the perennial
benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, beyond breeding for grain yield
maintenance over time, research is being
[SPEAKER_03]: carried out to understand how agronomic
management practices can affect pernza
[SPEAKER_03]: grain yields over time, while still
maintaining the sustainability benefits of
[SPEAKER_03]: its perniality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Findings in the 2018 paper by Toppies et
al.
[SPEAKER_03]: suggest that intercropping pernza with the
legume forage crop does have the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: to better maintain pernza grain yields
over time when compared to fertilized
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, next we're going to talk about how
intercropping sits in our sustainable
[SPEAKER_03]: perennial framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intercropping is the practice of having
two or more species of crops in one field
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Studies have shown that intercropping has
a host of benefits compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional monoculture, including yield
increases, which can lead to a higher land
[SPEAKER_03]: use efficiency, where the same yields can
be reduced on less land, as well as higher
[SPEAKER_03]: yield stability over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see these trends here in this
figure from Lee et al., where they
[SPEAKER_03]: intercropped maize with other grain crops,
including wheat, fava bean, soybean,
[SPEAKER_03]: chickpea, and oilseed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across multiple sites and nitrogen rates,
they found that grain yields were
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently higher in intercrop and in
monoculture, and that average grain yield
[SPEAKER_03]: increased over time when compared to
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inner species interactions lead to effects
like weed suppression, increases in
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen and carbon in the topsoil,
beneficial insect refuge, and disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these effects and more come
together to create the increases in yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: land use efficiency, and stability
documented in intercrops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we understand the benefits of
perennials, currnza, and intercropping in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, let's look at why we specifically
chose alfalfa to intercrop with our
[SPEAKER_03]: currnza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa is a legume, and legumes
symbiotically associate with nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: fixing rhizobial bacteria in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by trading carbon resources for the
nitrogen fixed by these rhizobia,
[SPEAKER_03]: they live in the nodules formed on the
legume's roots, like you can see in the
[SPEAKER_03]: picture here on the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this nitrogen not only benefits the
legume crop and reduces their need for
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic nitrogen fertilization,
but also can contribute nitrogen to the
[SPEAKER_03]: soils to be taken up by other plants in
the intercropping system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitrogen transfer to soils and crops is
accomplished through root and nodule
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue decomposition, root exudation,
or even directly from the legume to nearby
[SPEAKER_03]: crops through plant-associated mycorrhizae
mediated transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Research has shown that legumes in
intercrop with non-legumes do have the
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity to transfer as much nitrogen per
area as monoculture legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if enough nitrogen can be transferred
from legumes to the other crop and
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop to still support profitable crop
production, then less synthetic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer can be applied overall to the
intercrop, reducing both fertilizer cost
[SPEAKER_03]: and associated emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa was selected for intercropping
with kernza in the system because it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: widely used, profitable, and perennial
forage crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Studies have found that alfalfa nitrogen
transfer to grasses like kernza increases
[SPEAKER_03]: over time with production year,
indicating that its use in a perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: intercropping system could not only confer
previously mentioned intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits, but also more nitrogen to the
system as each year passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: As alfalfa is widely used, there are many
varieties that have been bred for specific
[SPEAKER_03]: performance metrics.
[SPEAKER_03]: One metric is fall dormancy rating,
which rates alfalfa fall regrowth on a
[SPEAKER_03]: scale of one to 11, with one having the
least fall regrowth and 11 having the
[SPEAKER_03]: greatest fall regrowth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fall dormancy is loosely correlated with
winter hardiness and fall dormancy ratings
[SPEAKER_03]: between three and five are well suited for
northern states that experience soil
[SPEAKER_03]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we use ratings of three to five in
our alfalfa varieties selected for this
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here in this picture we can see some
alfalfa and some kernza in our crop
[SPEAKER_03]: together here at New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if intercropping kernza with the
legume is able to help slow grain yield
[SPEAKER_03]: decline and reduce high sugar-lizer costs,
kernza grain still simply is not yet as
[SPEAKER_03]: high yielding and thus not as profitable
when compared to annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So farmers interested in growing kernza
may need to tailor their management
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques to maximize profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utilizing a dual-use system is one
potential method.
[SPEAKER_03]: A dual-use crop system is one with the
intended purpose of both harvesting grain
[SPEAKER_03]: and utilizing budgeted growth as forage
for livestock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Economic analyses of dual-use systems have
shown that they can both improve the
[SPEAKER_03]: profitability of a cropping system and
reduce business risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, dual-use systems can provide
a bridge in feed quality and quantity gaps
[SPEAKER_03]: for livestock at different times of the
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Analyses of kernza systems have
specifically shown that the financial risk
[SPEAKER_03]: of kernza grain production can be reduced
by managing a system for high forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yield, thus providing the farmer income
not only from grain but from its forage as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Further, intercropping alfalfa with kernza
will then not only benefit farmer bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: lines by increasing yields per area and
reducing notion fertilizer costs,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then also presents the opportunity for
multiple sources of income through the
[SPEAKER_03]: dual-use cropping system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said though, ideal kernza
management strategies to maximize profits
[SPEAKER_03]: are still largely dependent on kernza
grain prices at market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which are still shifting as the kernza
market develops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to summarize what we've learned so far,
to help reduce agriculturally associated
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse gas emissions, we can utilize
perennials over annuals and leverage the
[SPEAKER_03]: yield benefits for intercropping.
[SPEAKER_03]: To help reduce emissions and pollution
associated with nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: production and use, we can utilize legumes
and intercrop to provide biologically
[SPEAKER_03]: fixed nitrogen to the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: To help reduce grain yield to client
kernza, intercropping legumes should be
[SPEAKER_03]: investigated and to help kernza grain
farmers make up for small kernza grain
[SPEAKER_03]: yields compared to wheat, they can manage
their system for dual-use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we see the why of the system,
we can finally get into the how of our
[SPEAKER_03]: experimental objectives, designs,
and analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my first chapter, we investigated
whether intercropping kernza with alfalfa
[SPEAKER_03]: can reduce the need for synthetic nitrogen
fertilization while maintaining or
[SPEAKER_03]: improving grain and forage yields in
quality compared to monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also sought to understand how yields
change over time in this intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: system and different levels of nitrogen
fertilizer, as well as how all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters vary based on planting
locations across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my second chapter, we wanted to
understand how alfalfa variety affects the
[SPEAKER_03]: performance of this intercropping system
and compared alfalfa varieties with three
[SPEAKER_03]: different poll dominance ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to understand the effect of
environment on the kernza alfalfa system,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've replicated this experiment at four
locations across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here for now, University of
Wisconsin-Madison, University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota, and at the Land Institute in
Salina, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had four replicates at each location
and 23 treatments in each prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treatments included two cropping schemes,
intercropped and monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our monoculture plots were seeded at about
11.2 kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intercropped plots were seeded at 5.6
kilos per hectare of each species in what
[SPEAKER_03]: was known as a replacement intercropping
design, which is where rows are replaced
[SPEAKER_03]: with the second crop rather than the
second crop being planted in between rows,
[SPEAKER_03]: as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kansas itself did have a slightly
different planting scheme due to planting
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment limitations, but those
differences were accounted for in the
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data collection included kernza grain
yield, kernza forage biomass, and alfalfa
[SPEAKER_03]: forage biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also collected weed biomass,
but did not include it in the following
[SPEAKER_03]: analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We harvested both grain and forage biomass
in a quadrate basis by hand, and here we
[SPEAKER_03]: can see a hand harvested plot from last
summer in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: We completed summer harvests of grain and
forage once grain reached maturity and
[SPEAKER_03]: another harvest in the fall before first
frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: In year two, locations with available
labor also harvested biomass before kernza
[SPEAKER_03]: stem elongation in the spring,
but spray harvest data was not included in
[SPEAKER_03]: the following analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: After the spring harvest, plots were moved
and urea was applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we can see a picture of alfalfa
biomass being harvested from a quadrat in
[SPEAKER_03]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kansas location did not have
sufficient regrowth for any fall harvests,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we don't have their data for that,
and we also don't have any year two data
[SPEAKER_03]: for Minnesota, as they had to replant
their experiment in the next year due to
[SPEAKER_03]: rodent issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each replicant had both monoculture and
intercrop plots fertilized at one of five
[SPEAKER_03]: different nitrogen rates, increasing in
increments of 40 kilograms per hectare
[SPEAKER_03]: from zero to 160 kilograms of nitrogen per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used three different alfalfa varieties,
HiGest 360 with a fall dormancy rating of
[SPEAKER_03]: three, Shockwave VR with a fall dormancy
rating of four, and WL365HQ with a fall
[SPEAKER_03]: dormancy rating of five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only Shockwave was planted at all five
nitrogen rates because we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: have hundreds of plots at each location,
so HiGest and WL were only planted at zero
[SPEAKER_03]: and 80 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have one big experimental design for
both chapters, but used different subsets
[SPEAKER_03]: of the data for analysis in each chapter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of analysis, after the grain and
biomass was harvested, forage biomass was
[SPEAKER_03]: browned and analyzed using near infrared
spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our modeling of forage quality,
we used both crude protein values and
[SPEAKER_03]: relative feed values because they both
indicate the nutritive quality and
[SPEAKER_03]: usability in livestock.
[SPEAKER_03]: The relative feed value is calculated
using parameters from that near infrared
[SPEAKER_03]: spectroscopy to help understand the
performance of forage once fed to
[SPEAKER_03]: livestock.
[SPEAKER_03]: We analyzed the forage quality of each
species separately, so we also calculated
[SPEAKER_03]: a total crude protein and total relative
feed value for inner crop plots by
[SPEAKER_03]: adjusting the forage quality values based
on the proportion of biomass yield made up
[SPEAKER_03]: by each species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And despite breeding efforts, CURNSA still
has some crushability problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: meaning that the grain does not always
easily separate in this outer hull,
[SPEAKER_03]: thus skewing some of the masses that we
got from our grain yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we can see some CURNSA grain still in
its hull, and here is some d-hull yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used a digital imaging and analysis
software to estimate the proportion of
[SPEAKER_03]: d-hulled grain in a given subsample,
which we then used to perform adjustments
[SPEAKER_03]: on the total grain yield per plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were unable to complete this imaging
yet for year two, so we used year one
[SPEAKER_03]: adjustments in order to calculate the year
two d-hulled grain yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please keep in mind that technically
the year two grain yield results are
[SPEAKER_03]: preliminary moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forage harvest from each quadrat were
converted to kilogram per hectare yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then both mass-based yields and
land-to-field ratios were modeled for
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: More on land-to-field ratios in the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linear mixed-effects regression models
were created for each individual harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: because we did expect to see large
differences between both fall and summer
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest and year one and year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Results were log-transformed to new
assumptions, and post-hoc analyses
[SPEAKER_03]: included analysis of variance and pairwise
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The factors that we included in the
nitrogen ratio study were, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, environment, and crop and
system, and factors included in the
[SPEAKER_03]: variety study were genotype, environment,
and crop and system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as mentioned, land-to-field ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our intercropping was in a replacement
design, meaning that there's half the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeding rate of each crop in the intercrop
compared to monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to compare the performance
between monoculture and intercrops,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can use the land-to-field ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: To visually explain this, if here in
yellow we have a monoculture of Curenza,
[SPEAKER_03]: and here in green we have a monoculture of
alfalfa covering the same area,
[SPEAKER_03]: and here we see our alfalfa Curenza
intercrop over the same area with half the
[SPEAKER_03]: total area taken up by each species.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, for example, may expect to see six
kilos from a hectare of Curenza.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not an accurate number,
but easy numbers for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we may expect to see four kilos from a
hectare of alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with half the seeding rate in our
intercrop, we'd expect to see half those
[SPEAKER_03]: yields of intercrop, but due to the
facilitative effects of intercropping that
[SPEAKER_03]: lead to over yielding, as discussed
earlier, we often actually see greater
[SPEAKER_03]: yields in a given land area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in this example, if we saw three
kilos from alfalfa and four kilos from
[SPEAKER_03]: Curenza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using these expected and actual yields,
we can calculate the partial land-to-field
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio for each species, and then sum them
to find the land-to-field ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this example, the partial LER for
Curenza would be the yield to intercrop,
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the yield in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we see a value greater than 0.5 for
the partial LER, we then see an over
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding effect in that species.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same calculation can be done for
alfalfa, comparing intercrop to
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture, and if we see a value greater
than 0.5, we see over yielding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can add these values together to
figure out our land-to-field ratio for
[SPEAKER_03]: entire intercrop plot, and comparing
expected or over yielding to expected,
[SPEAKER_03]: and if we see a value greater than 1,
then we see over yielding in the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, we can finally get into some
results for the nitrogen rate study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with grain yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for both years, we saw significant
interactions between environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is E in the table, and nitrogen
rate, which is N in the table,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as environment and cropping
system, which is C in the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our stars indicate significant levels from
our ANOVAs, and at a p-value of 0.5,
[SPEAKER_03]: with more stars indicating a greater
degree of significance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we can see mean grain yield values
in kilograms per hectare at each nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: rate at each site, with lines fitted from
our linear mixed-effects regressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lines in red are from year 1 data,
and lines in blue are from year 2 data,
[SPEAKER_03]: with dotted lines being monoculture
carensa, and solid lines being intercrop
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we can see in the graphs, nitrogen rate
only had a significant effect on grain
[SPEAKER_03]: yield in New York in year 1, and at
Wisconsin in year 2.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sites that did not have a
significant difference in grain yield
[SPEAKER_03]: between nitrogen rates, this indicates
that applying nitrogen does not
[SPEAKER_03]: meaningfully increase grain yields in
either cropping system, so a farmer could
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce or eliminate nitrogen application
while still maintaining grain yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the environment by cropping system
interaction, the effect of cropping system
[SPEAKER_03]: did vary by site, but we only see a
significant difference in grain yields
[SPEAKER_03]: between cropping system in New York in
year 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: No significant difference in grain yields
between cropping systems shows that
[SPEAKER_03]: despite half the seeding rate of carensa
in intercrop, intercrop grain yields were
[SPEAKER_03]: still comparable to monoculture grain
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, the effects of environment that
we do see here, and we'll see across many
[SPEAKER_03]: of our response variables, may come from a
lot of sources, including variability in
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, precipitation, soil nutrient
loads, soil types, and weed pressure,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, here in New York,
we had weed pressure in the form of white
[SPEAKER_03]: clover, which encroached on monoculture
carensa plots as the clover filled in that
[SPEAKER_03]: they get a new niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could have affected the nitrogen load
in the soil, although we did still see an
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of nitrogen rate in these plots of
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another factor that may have affected
grain yields was lodging.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did observe lodging at high nitrogen
rates in both intercrop and monoculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: and as we can see here in this picture of
monoculture carensa at 160 kilograms of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen per hectare, lodging may not only
decrease grain yield, but also make the
[SPEAKER_03]: grain harvest a lot harder for farmers who
plan to use a combine to collect grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our grain partial land implement ratio
results support these plans about the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of crop system and nitrogen rate on
grain yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not see significant effect of
nitrogen rate on grain culture LER in
[SPEAKER_03]: either year, indicating that any over
yielding effects are independent of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen application.
[SPEAKER_03]: These graphs show the response of grain
culture LER to nitrogen rate in both years
[SPEAKER_03]: at all sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dashed red line is at 0.5,
above which indicates a yield advantage in
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Year one and year two grain partial LER
results showed that grain yields had a
[SPEAKER_03]: yield advantage in intercrop compared to
monoculture across nation rates and
[SPEAKER_03]: locations, except in New York in year one,
Kansas in year two, and at 160 kilograms
[SPEAKER_03]: of nitrogen per hectare in year one if
confidence intervals are taken into
[SPEAKER_03]: account.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do see some outliers at Kansas,
which may have skewed the year one data in
[SPEAKER_03]: favor of a grain yield advantage in
intercrop, but as year two grain yields
[SPEAKER_03]: are preliminary, we do hesitate to make
any strong claims about the effect of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rate or crop system on grain
yields over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We generally do observe that year two
grain partial LER values were higher
[SPEAKER_03]: across locations and nitrogen rates in
year two than year one, which can indicate
[SPEAKER_03]: that intercropping may help ameliorate
grain yields declining over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, we can look at forage side of the
dual use system.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a three-way nitrogen rate,
environment, crop system interaction in
[SPEAKER_03]: year one summer, year one fall,
and year two summer, as well as a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant effect of environment,
as well as a nitrogen rate by crop system
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction in year two fall, which
highlights the total forage yield reaction
[SPEAKER_03]: to crop system and nitrogen rate is very
site-specific, which does make sense as
[SPEAKER_03]: forage yields can be highly dependent on
site-specific and annually variable
[SPEAKER_03]: factors like precipitation, temperature,
and nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now would also be a good time to recognize
that the alfalfa stands were not managed
[SPEAKER_03]: in a typical harvest pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually alfalfa stands are harvested
multiple times over a summer growing
[SPEAKER_03]: season, which maximizes forage yields and
quality, but because our currants of
[SPEAKER_03]: forage cannot be harvested in the summer
to avoid disrupting grain development,
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa also cannot be harvested in the
intercrop, so we also do not harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture alfalfa until grain yield time
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this picture, you can see our senior
research associate Julie Hanson holding up
[SPEAKER_03]: some of this late summer monoculture
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it's very stem-y, it's lost a
lot of its leaves, and therefore is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a pretty low forage quality,
but because we're most interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: comparing intercrop plots to monoculture
corinza just to see how the presence of
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa benefits overall yield and
quality, we still included monoculture
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa as a benchmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, here we have some graphs
of our total forage biomass yields by
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rate, crop system, and location.
[SPEAKER_03]: We now have three lines comparing
intercrop to monoculture corinza and
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture alfalfa, with the different
colors then representing different
[SPEAKER_03]: harvests across the two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only saw a significant response of
nitrogen rate in monoculture corinza,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there was a positive correlation
between nitrogen rate and total forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yield, which is expected for a grass that
cannot fix its own nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also saw in New York in year one,
in their fall harvest, there was an
[SPEAKER_03]: inverse relationship between nitrogen rate
and total forage yield in intercrop plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do not see a significant
positive response to nitrogen in intercrop
[SPEAKER_03]: plots, this indicates that intercropping
corinza with alfalfa provides the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to reduce or eliminate
nitrogen fertilizer application and costs,
[SPEAKER_03]: while still maintaining a high total
forage yields when compared to monoculture
[SPEAKER_03]: corinza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, we found that intercrop
total forage yield was significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: higher in monoculture corinza across
nitrogen rates in the fall harvests of
[SPEAKER_03]: both years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not see this effect in summer
harvests, but some locations did have
[SPEAKER_03]: higher summer total forage yields at lower
nitrogen rates than monoculture corinza.
[SPEAKER_03]: A higher total forage yield in intercrop
during fall harvests, but not summer
[SPEAKER_03]: harvests, shows that a system like this
may be best for grain farmers looking to
[SPEAKER_03]: get higher yields and qualities from their
fall forages, but that still recognize
[SPEAKER_03]: that their intercrop summer forage yields
may not necessarily be higher than corinza
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across crop and systems, we generally saw
a decrease between years one and two
[SPEAKER_03]: summer harvest total forage as expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, intercrop total forage yield was
higher than monoculture corinza total
[SPEAKER_03]: forage yield from year two summer
harvests, indicating that the farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: could benefit from a greater total forage
yield over time with the intercrop than
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture corinza.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the most dramatic changes in total
forage yield over time in Kansas across
[SPEAKER_03]: all crop and systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: In year one, we did observe a much higher
total Monday precipitation at Kansas in
[SPEAKER_03]: the late spring, compared to year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our hypothesis is that this
precipitation may have increased soil
[SPEAKER_03]: water availability during either critical
growth periods or just throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire growing season, which could bolster
forage yields and actually make the year
[SPEAKER_03]: one forage yields more of the outlier than
year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look at our LER results again to
understand whether intercropping conferred
[SPEAKER_03]: a total forage yield advantage compared to
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only see a significant response to
nitrogen rate in year two summer where
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an inverse relationship between
nitrogen and LER, indicating that forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yield advantage in intercrop is more
likely at lower nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, a higher nitrogen
fertilizer application in monoculture is
[SPEAKER_03]: more likely to match any yield advantage
conferred by intercropping than a low
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, LER results consistently showed
an advantage for intercropping across
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rates, except at 120 to 160
kilograms of nitrogen per hectare in year
[SPEAKER_03]: one summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 160 kilograms in year two summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw that LER values were higher in year
two than in year one for both summer and
[SPEAKER_03]: fall harvest in Wisconsin, for summer
harvest in New York, and at low nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: rates in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_03]: A greater yield advantage in intercrop in
year two is likely tied to the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: root and nodule composition is the main
mechanism for nitrogen transfer from
[SPEAKER_03]: legumes, and these tissues just have had
more time to turn over by year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while forage biomass yields are
important, forage quality is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: important when feeding forage to
livestock, and therefore can have a large
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on profitability.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a significant three-way interaction
in year one summer and varying
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions between the factors for other
harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: While our NOVA results tell us that
nitrogen rate had a significant effect on
[SPEAKER_03]: total crude protein, we in fact see that
there was no significant difference in
[SPEAKER_03]: total crude protein between nitrogen rates
within a given cropping system and
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monoculture alfalfa total crude protein
was significantly higher than monoculture
[SPEAKER_03]: corinza, which is expected when comparing
a legume to a grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Total forage crude protein values in
intercrop plots were higher than
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture corinza, regardless of
nitrogen rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: This indicates that intercropping corinza
with the legume does in fact confer a
[SPEAKER_03]: forage quality benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the inverse relationship between
total crude protein and nitrogen rate in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York's smart harvest that we can see
here was contrary to expectations that
[SPEAKER_03]: providing more nitrogen to the system
would reduce nitrogen scarcity and
[SPEAKER_03]: therefore increase total crude protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: One hypothesis is that this may have been
due to higher nitrogen availability,
[SPEAKER_03]: leading to a greater nitrogen allocation
to the grain rather than to the forage,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as we don't have grain quality data,
this hypothesis cannot yet be tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, both the general lack of effect
of nitrogen on the total crude protein,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as that decrease in total crude
protein would increase nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: indicates that farmers' intercropping
corinza and alfalfa could again save money
[SPEAKER_03]: while maintaining forage quality by
decreasing their synthetic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also observed that fall harvests had
higher crude protein than summer harvests,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was expected with a shorter regrowth
period between summer and fall harvests
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to spring harvests and summer
harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: While not statistically compared,
we also generally saw that year two crude
[SPEAKER_03]: protein values were equal to or greater
than year one values, which is expected
[SPEAKER_03]: again with transferring more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so for total relative feed
value, we only saw a three-way interaction
[SPEAKER_03]: in year two summer, but nitrogen rate only
had a significant effect on total R&D in
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop crops in Kansas in year two
summer, where total R&D decreased with
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing nitrogen rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, at New York and Wisconsin in
year two summer, there was no significant
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in total R&D across crop and
systems and nitrate rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: This with the fact that we did not see a
significant effect of nitrogen during
[SPEAKER_03]: other harvests in the case that there is
no total R&D advantage to apply nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: to intercropped corinza and alfalfa
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we saw significant crop and system
effects across harvests, intercrop total R
[SPEAKER_03]: &D was generally greater than or equal to
R&D and monoculture corinza across
[SPEAKER_03]: locations and harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both total CP and total R&D were generally
higher in fall harvests and summer
[SPEAKER_03]: harvests, across locations, crop systems,
and nitrate rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though we did not yet analyze spring
harvests, we would expect to find similar
[SPEAKER_03]: things with spring quality higher than
summer quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This higher quality forage in these
marginal seasons could be more valuable to
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers by helping bridge any existing
feed quality gaps after the main forage
[SPEAKER_03]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to recap our results from the nitrogen
rate study, we did not see a significant
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of nitrogen on grain, total forage
yields, or total forage quality in
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intercropping significantly increased fall
total forage yields and intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: increased forage quality when compared to
monoculture corinza.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while not yet modeled, we generally
observed that grain yields did decline
[SPEAKER_03]: over time, but preliminary results
indicate that intercropping may decrease
[SPEAKER_03]: the rate of grain yield decline over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: These results indicate that a dual use
intercropped corinza alfalfa system may be
[SPEAKER_03]: a viable route for maintaining corinza
grain production for more profitable farm
[SPEAKER_03]: systems when compared to monoculture
corinza by reducing nitrogen input needs
[SPEAKER_03]: and at those lower nitrogen rates,
increasing grain and forage yield over
[SPEAKER_03]: time over a given area, increasing forage
quality, and potentially maintaining
[SPEAKER_03]: higher grain yields over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, to truly identify the best system
for the work must be done to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: the costs and benefits of the corinza
alfalfa system based on the cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen and the value of the grain and
forage yields over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the markets most readily
available to farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you're still with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have just a few more slides of results
for the alfalfa variety study,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are luckily pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, even though we only
fertilized all three of the varieties at
[SPEAKER_03]: two nitrogen rates, we found that there
was no significant interaction between
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rate and variety for any of the
response variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we removed nitrogen as a factor in all
models.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were also no significant genotype by
crop system, genotype by environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: or three way interactions for any of our
response variables, which indicates that
[SPEAKER_03]: no one variety is better suited to a
single environment than another,
[SPEAKER_03]: nor are any varieties better suited to
intercropping than another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did see significant environment by crop
system interactions indicating
[SPEAKER_03]: intercropping success does vary with
environment, which is what we also saw in
[SPEAKER_03]: the last chapter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start with our forage and grain
yield results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise this slide is not as scary as it
looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not include corinza monoculture
yields in total forage quality or models
[SPEAKER_03]: because there is no level of variety of
alfalfa from corinza monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for corinza yields, we only looked at
variety performance and intercropping.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we did see an effect of
variety on alfalfa forage yields and total
[SPEAKER_03]: forage yields in year one.
[SPEAKER_03]: For both alfalfa yield and total forage
yield, the variety shockwave VR led to
[SPEAKER_03]: significant significantly higher summer
yield than WL365HQ and significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: higher fall yield than in high-gest.
[SPEAKER_03]: This indicates that out of three
varieties, shockwave VR may be the most
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable choice for forage yields,
at least in year one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Its performance may have been correlated
with its fall dormancy rating,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also may have had additional
attributes not quantified in the study
[SPEAKER_03]: that may have led to higher total forage
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: While there's no significant differences
in alfalfa over total forage yield in year
[SPEAKER_03]: two, additional data in year three may
better elucidate the trend in total forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yield changes over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the environment by crop assistive
interactions, intercrop total forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yields were higher than monoculture across
sites and harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not see any effect of genotype on
corinza forage or grain yields,
[SPEAKER_03]: which indicates that no one variety
increases corinza yields in intercrop more
[SPEAKER_03]: than another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not see a significant effect of
genotype on total LER across harvests,
[SPEAKER_03]: indicating that no one variety leads to a
greater forage over-yielding effect in
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop compared to the other varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: While no variety was statistically greater
than another, all the varieties total LER
[SPEAKER_03]: confidence intervals did exceed one,
indicating over-yielding effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: except for shockwave VR in year one
summer, which is interesting considering
[SPEAKER_03]: we did see it had higher total forage
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the nitrogen rate study,
we did see a significant effect on
[SPEAKER_03]: environment in total LER.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we can see it reflected in these box
plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we might not see it in these graphs
because they're on different scales,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we did see a total LER that was
greater in fall than in summer harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see similar trends in grain partial
LER.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no significant effects of
genotype across years, which indicates
[SPEAKER_03]: that no one variety leads to a higher
grade yield advantage in intercrop than
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: While no variety was statistically greater
than another, confidence intervals
[SPEAKER_03]: indicated that a grain yield advantage
intercropping is likely for both shockwave
[SPEAKER_03]: VR and high just 360 in year one,
but not for WL365HQ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Variety performance in intercrop,
again, varies with environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw in year one in New York,
confidence intervals actually did not show
[SPEAKER_03]: that intercropping gave a grain yield
advantage for any variety, which may have
[SPEAKER_03]: been related to the lodging we have
discussed previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our forage quality, there was no
significant effect of genotype on a total
[SPEAKER_03]: crude protein or total relative feed
value, which indicates that no one variety
[SPEAKER_03]: prefers forage quality advantage in
intercrop over another.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the effect was not uniform across
environments, there was generally a lower
[SPEAKER_03]: total crude protein and total relative
feed value in intercrop compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: monoculture alfalfa, which is expected
with the lower proportion of legumes in
[SPEAKER_03]: intercrop.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we do not include monoculture
current analysis, we would expect there to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a lower forage quality than intercrop
as seen in the previous chapter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well, we would also expect to see
no effect on currents of forage quality
[SPEAKER_03]: from genotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: To summarize our findings for the alfalfa
variety study, out of the three varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: tested, we did not find one to be better
suited to the environments tested,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we did not find one to be best suited
to intercrop forage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did find that variety had significant
effect on alfalfa forage yield and total
[SPEAKER_03]: forage yield in year one, with shockwave
VR more consistently providing a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: yield than other two varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Variety did not have a significant effect
on currents of grain yield or forage
[SPEAKER_03]: yield, total forage of grain over
yielding, or forage quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we saw some effective variety on
total forage yields, we cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: definitively say that this was an effect
of ball dormancy rating of shockwave,
[SPEAKER_03]: as this was a rather narrow study,
only using three varieties of three ball
[SPEAKER_03]: dormancy readings, which may not have
actually been representative for ball
[SPEAKER_03]: dormancy group.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also only tested these varieties across
four legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there may have been other attributes
of the varieties besides ball dormancy
[SPEAKER_03]: rating that contributed to the role of
this result.
[SPEAKER_03]: To bring together all of our findings from
this current alfalfa intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment, our results show that a farmer
focused on the current grain yield
[SPEAKER_03]: production could potentially benefit from
a dual-use current alfalfa intercropping
[SPEAKER_03]: system, with grain yield advantages during
the summer and a higher forage biomass of
[SPEAKER_03]: higher quality in the fall, while
increasing profits through synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also found that ball dormancy rating
may not have an effect on alfalfa variety
[SPEAKER_03]: performance and intercropping trends of
beyond year one forage yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite these initially promising
findings, we recognize that the study was
[SPEAKER_03]: limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have two years of data,
only four locations, and only three
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa varieties, with only three ball
dormancy ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of work this study and
future studies could continue to do to
[SPEAKER_03]: overcome these limitations to better
improve our understanding of the dual-use
[SPEAKER_03]: current alfalfa system.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the study, we plan to include a third
year of harvest data next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: and longer term studies are generally
important for perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both this study and future studies could
be improved through more thorough modeling
[SPEAKER_03]: of relevant parameters, including the
effect of pre-existing soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions and their changes over time,
how the system and its management affects
[SPEAKER_03]: grade quality, and how confounding factors
like weed pressure, row spacing,
[SPEAKER_03]: and inter-annual weather variability
affects outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding of currenza is ongoing and will
continue to be important as we pursue
[SPEAKER_03]: larger grain sizes and yields,
slower yield to crop finds, and optimized
[SPEAKER_03]: currenza for use in intercrop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there's plenty of other
management effects that could be
[SPEAKER_03]: investigated beyond entry fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different alfalfa varieties should be
tested for or bred for intercrop,
[SPEAKER_03]: more work on that coming soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And overall, while findings are promising,
economic analyses will be very important
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand how reducing nitrogen
fertilization and intercropping in a
[SPEAKER_03]: dual-use system actually affects
profitability in farmer bottom lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I'd like to thank my committee
members for the guidance and kindness,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my collaborators for the patience and
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank my lab members for all
the laughs in the field and all the help
[SPEAKER_03]: in the field, and of course, my friends
and family for their unwavering love and
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a privilege to work on this
project, and I really love my time at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell, but I'm also very excited for my
next chapter back in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, thank you all for your
time, and please feel free to ask any
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did not analyze that, but we did
largely observe it, mostly at New York in
[SPEAKER_03]: year two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other locations definitely have observed
it, and there is some work saying that
[SPEAKER_03]: lodging rate is likely associated with
higher nitrogen rates, but no one has
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically looked at environment effects
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can expect to see that all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very naive question about these
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're going to have to be
renovated, like alfalfa has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: renovated.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do these go before, typically,
do we plow and we renovate whole systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so that's one of the problems with
the currents of forage yield decline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my first graph, we saw that those
intermediate wheatgrass successions,
[SPEAKER_03]: they declined after one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, the literature says that the
yield decline is after two years,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the forage yield decline, we typically
see them after around three years for both
[SPEAKER_03]: currensite and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we're looking at farmers
probably wanting to renovate after three
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but the more work we can do on the
system to keep yields higher for longer,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to have that three-year
perennial benefit over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the typical alfalfa renovation would
then be your cycle, because the currensite
[SPEAKER_02]: would keep the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about the grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think intercropping is
important?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: A large part of it is thought that by
keeping nitrogen rates consistent and
[SPEAKER_03]: higher over time in the field,
then we reduce that limitation and make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that grain yields get to stay high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it might just be one of those
intercropping effects that have not been
[SPEAKER_03]: fully understood yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's still more work that needs
to be done there to truly understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think Jake's work found that
between the nitrogen and the alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen rates are high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get hopes that the first year we're
going to have nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do need to be in effect,
that would be a really cool thing to do.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fellow currenza homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding that you're saying you're
not seeing an effect of nitrogen rates on
[SPEAKER_02]: much of it, not in the protein,
not in the grain, but not on the yield
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's all the weight you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is about if we're not
seeing a nitrogen effect, where is that
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen going in the system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it running off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to weeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are both options.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're not seeing a nitrogen effect
in intercrop, it is essentially because
[SPEAKER_03]: the legume is helping provide enough
nitrogen that the currenza does not need
[SPEAKER_03]: to continue to forage for the excess
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would expect it to either stay in
the system or go to weeds or run off or
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially if there are any other changes
in nutrient balances, maybe go into other
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms within the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did some baseline testing on our
soils, but it was not to depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if all of the patients
actually tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was mostly just to make sure that
our nitrogen and our potassium and our
[SPEAKER_03]: sulfur and our, you know, the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making sure that they were all in
balance, but I think that more in depth
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis of nitrogen cycling throughout
the whole system would be really
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting to understand where everything
is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hand harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can find a good example of
what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see how I'm basically just grabbing
the bundle of currenza.
[SPEAKER_03]: We basically just cut the grain heads off
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dry them, we brush them, but that's
part mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is experimental mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Theoretically, we can use combines.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our locations, Kansas, actually did
use a combine to harvest in year two
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have limited data or limited
labor for hand harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have some farmers that are
actually growing currenza on farm and they
[SPEAKER_03]: use a combine for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work and a lot of intriguing data
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering whether you had nitrogen
uptake data and you could calculate from
[SPEAKER_02]: the trade-off between adding nitrogen and
the lack of nitrogen uptake or somewhat a
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen transfer equivalence from lake to
non-lake to answer maybe a question or
[SPEAKER_00]: provide some fine points on the mechanisms
why nitrogen doesn't increase because it's
a trade-off between getting it from the
legume and getting it from the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: and somewhat cleverly use the data to
calculate that transfer rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we actually did calculate a
parameter that we called relative yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: which actually means a lot of good things,
but the way we calculated it, we compared
[SPEAKER_03]: intercropped plots at zero nitrogen rate
to monoculture plots of currenza and
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa at the different nitrogen rate
levels and using that portion,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we could basically estimate how the
intercropped plots with no mesh fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: compare to fertilizer effects in other
plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of did do some fun data stuff
to approximate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really find any results that
were surprising or exciting or necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: worth including in a 45 minutes,
but I do have that in my paper if you
[SPEAKER_03]: would like to see that at the end of the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I agree that I think a more thorough
understanding of where the nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_02]: going in the system is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sort of two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, do you know the the yield define
that you get in the second year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody looked at nitrogen
immobilization by the microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sort of feeding the microbes
instead of feeding the crop when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding that fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a follow-up question to that is,
how much of the yields declined in
[SPEAKER_00]: investment investigated in out years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you waited three, four, five years
to your yields start coming back but that
[SPEAKER_00]: something is changing below ground and
they basically just stay low.
[SPEAKER_03]: For your first question, we have not
specifically investigated that yet in the
[SPEAKER_03]: system, seeing whether immobilization is a
large factor in that decline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of whether or not we see
regression, basically, I have not seen any
[SPEAKER_03]: of that in the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pretty typically is just a steady
downward decline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a lot of thought on what may
be causing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is greater amounts of leafing
out and tillering, well not tillering,
[SPEAKER_03]: but basically reallocation of resources
away from grain and towards biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Janice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question for people going up here
was whether or not we actually checked if
[SPEAKER_03]: the alfalfa had any nodulation going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did use a pre-treated seed for the
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hopefully saw some rhizobia
association, but we did not check
[SPEAKER_03]: nodulation rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were just assuming that the rhizomes
were doing their job down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the results that we saw at low
nitrogen rates in intercropping,
[SPEAKER_03]: we assume that they were giving some
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the fact that intercropping
itself, even without like in the system,
[SPEAKER_03]: can still contribute over yielding
effects, then it is hard to untangle that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did not check nodules, but we do
assume that there were at least some doing
[SPEAKER_03]: their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question through the slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so nitrogen application was done in the
spring, basically during regrowth and
[SPEAKER_03]: right after spring mowing, so around
April, early May timeframe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the nitrogen was applied just at
that one point in the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could potentially see different
effects if we did a split application
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the year, but that's not the
experimental design we went with.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of weed control, we largely left
that up to site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that, for example, Minnesota I
think did some spraying for shepherds
[SPEAKER_03]: first and Kansas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kansas had plenty of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had alfalfa weevils.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had spraying for different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so each site only did their
management as they saw fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in New York, we didn't really do
much management.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we certainly saw clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw, we see a lot of perennial weeds in
the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we people know, in perennial systems,
you have a shift towards perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had lots of Timothy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Canadian Thistle, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even our reps varied in how weedy it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so weed management is one of our
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a perennial system, you can't just,
especially with a system that both has
[SPEAKER_03]: grasses in it, you can't, you know,
you have different modes of action when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't necessarily, you know,
just unlike it apply any weed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks all for coming.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
