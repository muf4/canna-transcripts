[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jen, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, a couple of weeks ago,
Jen talked to me about the seminar
[SPEAKER_04]: possibility here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of scared, because bacteria and
the mammals and the plants are different
[SPEAKER_04]: kingdoms, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, OK, we are different
kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: How that can work here?
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I thought, OK, anyway,
so the central dogma between plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria and mammals, they're the same,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And in particular, also, I think plants
also have ubiquity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like, fine, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And OK, here's my talk today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll tell you about a story about how
this bacteria hijacking ubiquity system in
[SPEAKER_04]: the host for the benefit of infections.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so this is a bacteria called
Legionella pneumophila.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look from this structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure of this bacteria is like a
raw bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gram-negative intracellular
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's not like an obligated human
pathogen, but sometimes it's a natural
[SPEAKER_04]: host.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a freshwater amoeba.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somehow, when the people getting
inhaled, the air source contain this
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they will cause a disease,
an acute type of pneumonia disease called
[SPEAKER_04]: Legionella's pneumophila.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Legionella's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so this disease actually first
reported in 1976, I guess, so that the
[SPEAKER_04]: Legion Convention in Philadelphia in a
hotel and a big ballroom and 200,
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 people in a party together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that, tons of people get sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, the CDC twists down what
caused the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out to be a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the time magazine has this
title here, Tracing the Philly Killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that party, 30 people died for this
infection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ever since then, because people are
aware of the disease and have reported
[SPEAKER_04]: more and more cases every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a website, actually,
all cases reported to this website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens all over the world and every
year, all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember, you probably heard the
news too, last year, Issaquah downtown has
[SPEAKER_04]: an outbreak of the infection in Issaquah
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, how they can cause a disease?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the bacteria enter into the lungs,
it will pick up by the aviola macrophage
[SPEAKER_04]: cells through the process called
phagocytosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the bacteria goes into the cells,
it has a weapon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call it a type 4 secretion system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see this needle penetrates the
membrane, which engulfs this, circulates
[SPEAKER_04]: this bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it delivers tons of bacteria proteins
into the host, the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, they just hijack a variety of
host pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it can intercept vesicles derived
from ER and decrypt on the surface of LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: They secrete the proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: They change the identity of these vacuums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can prevent the detections
by hosting native immunity, like a fuse of
[SPEAKER_04]: endosomalizosome for degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to happen in this case,
because they change identity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hide the bacteria inside this vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then basically, it expands and takes
the nutrients from the host, replicates it
[SPEAKER_04]: inside the vacuum, within the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, it will life the
vacuolized cell and spread the infections.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do the infections in the lab,
in the tissue culture cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can incubate the bacteria with the
tissue culture within 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_04]: almost like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two cells of the cytosol will be occupied
by these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they will life and break the
cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they spread out into bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see very briefly,
this is like pathogenic pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out, if you look at it
molecularly, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those bacteria proteins, particularly
in the host cells, they are sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: better cell body than us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know all the cell pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cellular mechanisms, cellular pathways,
they secrete those weapons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can deal with a high draft or
whatever variety of host pathways,
[SPEAKER_04]: including lipids, cytoskeletons,
ubiquitins, you can name it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in the host, in the hereditary
cells, the bacteria knows how to
[SPEAKER_04]: manipulate and benefit for their growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give you some example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, we find actually this bacteria
secrete this phosphatated lipids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those like CDP and CDF, they can
specifically hydrolyze those three species
[SPEAKER_04]: of the phosphatidoneinositide,
which in eukaryotes maybe implants the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it serves as like a zip code for
different kind of organelles inside the
[SPEAKER_04]: cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So initially, the phagosomes have
decorated with the PI3, P34, or 345.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the PI3T is the marker for
endosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to get rid of the three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they secrete those
phagosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The enzymes remove all three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually also some people,
other people reported that the kinase is
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they convert all the
phosphatidoneinositide into PI4P,
[SPEAKER_04]: which enrich or function as a marker for
the end, for Golgi and ER type of
[SPEAKER_04]: organelles in the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they can hide the spectra
inside of the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're mimicking the host itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they don't, the host don't
detect this and just ignore this for
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, just to give you another flavor,
another example, just to show you how the
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria's knowledge of so versatile and
knows everything of the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is another example.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also can invade, exploit the host
cytoskeletons for probably for the entry
[SPEAKER_04]: or trafficking within the cell after they
get into the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an example here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the effect called a MAFH.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very simple protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a PI3P binding domains at the
N-terminus and the C-terminus has a
[SPEAKER_04]: WH-like actin binding protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when you add this liposomes
contained incubated with these proteins
[SPEAKER_04]: and also add the actin, shown in blue
here, you can see this actin was
[SPEAKER_04]: stimulated, stimulated the polymerization
by this effector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see this not only
polymerize the actin, it also deforms this
[SPEAKER_04]: membrane, the tubules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turned out that actually this
effector secreted at a very early time
[SPEAKER_04]: during infections, once the bacteria make
a count test with the host and they
[SPEAKER_04]: recruit actins and then polymerize the
actin at the contact sites and the
[SPEAKER_04]: polymerize actin and they speed up the
phygo cytoskeletons process and facilitate
[SPEAKER_04]: a bacterial entry into the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's another example actually,
which right now actually on my lab
[SPEAKER_04]: actually mainly focused on is that this
bacteria also secreted numerous of the
[SPEAKER_04]: effectors, the kind of a milking or
manipulated host mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know mitochondria is the energy hub
and also produce a lot of more
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites, which may be useful for the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the bacteria needed to kind of
hijack or utilize the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rewiring the host mitochondrial functions
for their benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do some kind of preliminary
predictions and we have like more than a
[SPEAKER_04]: dozen of those effectors, probably they're
locally secreted and localized anchored to
[SPEAKER_04]: the host mitochondria and change the
function of mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to give you a little bit of
example here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually this is the host mitochondria,
what it looks like in eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have some, it will express the
effectors.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, here is the LPG-1803 and it
changes totally the morphology of
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria and it causes aggregation of
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another example, for example,
Lam-12, it also secreted into the host
[SPEAKER_04]: anchored or localized to the host
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when my student started this and he
find out actually once this effector goes
[SPEAKER_04]: into cells, it recruits a host phosphatase
to the mitochondria and it dephosphorizes
[SPEAKER_04]: some proteins on the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they can inhibit the
mitochondria, basically stabilize
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria and then inhibit
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have a time to cover in
details, but let's just give you a taste
[SPEAKER_04]: of some examples how the bacteria can
invade a variety of host pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly for today's talk,
I will mainly focus on another major
[SPEAKER_04]: conservative pathway in eukaryotes,
which is ubiquitin autophagy pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the bacteria secret numerous
effectors and rewiring the host ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_04]: system for the benefit of growth inside
the intracellular lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now we'll go to some more
details.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I give you some background here,
so if we just look at the sequences of
[SPEAKER_04]: this bacteria genome and you can identify
some kind of a sequence homology,
[SPEAKER_04]: some effector actually did encoding the
F-box or U-box, which are part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin nation machinery proteins like
E3 ligases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can probably, some of them have
been tested actually, they can function E3
[SPEAKER_04]: ligases.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, there's some other
effectors people can identify and actually
[SPEAKER_04]: they can serve a function of the
ubiquitinase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and so our lab actually are the
first also identify another unique type of
[SPEAKER_04]: HEC-like E3 ligases, which represented by
CDC and DCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will tell you the story about how we
narrowed down this E3 ligases and how they
[SPEAKER_04]: function in the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so because of the way Jen introduced
them, I was initially interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphoenosis lipid signaling and
functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started this because this protein
and as a big protein secretor and only
[SPEAKER_04]: people knows it can bind the PI4P.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the binding of the lipids,
it anchored on the surface of the LCL.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regenerative containing vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides that, nobody knows,
it's just really totally blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since I trained as a X-ray
crystallographer, so we solved the
[SPEAKER_04]: structure of these proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out that this protein has
multiple domains, as you can see from
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And immediately from the structure,
we can see the domain, which we call the
[SPEAKER_04]: name of the P4C actually to combine the
PI4P.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this P4C domain actually has a 4-alpha
helical gun bundle.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the top of this is a pocket which is
negatively charged, which ideally can fit
[SPEAKER_04]: into this phosphoenositide of 4P,
4-phosphate, which is negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this actually turned out to be very
specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we find this actually a lot of lab
requested for this construct as a probe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use it as a probe to detect the
PI4P in the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is the binding, but at
n-terminus, we have no idea what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a structural biologist,
usually you will search the database and
[SPEAKER_04]: see which ones are similar to this,
and then maybe you can infer any
[SPEAKER_04]: functional clues for this domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out that this structure is
unique, nothing similar to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we solved the structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of struggled for almost two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what it is, and it was hard
for me to publish a paper without any
[SPEAKER_04]: function.
[SPEAKER_04]: So until one day, suddenly that idea comes
out, so come to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically we should analyze also the
primary sequence to see whether or not
[SPEAKER_04]: there's any conserved amino acid,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's normally what people do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it turned out this protein actually,
about the 20%, 30% amino acids are sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: identical across different general
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you only see them in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see any other species for this
protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the homology is quite high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between different species, 20% is
identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's harder to see which one is
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But luckily we have the structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can map those identical residues to the
structure and see what happens with the
[SPEAKER_04]: assumption that maybe this can function as
an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it was a function of the
enzyme, then usually you should see a
[SPEAKER_04]: surface patch which has a class of
identical conserved residues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, excitingly, we see when we do
that, we immediately see the pocket here
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of a cluster on the surface here,
which contains all the identical residues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in other places, the majority of them
are actually embedded inside the protein,
[SPEAKER_04]: which probably is for structural purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But only here you see the patch with
conserved identical residues.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look closely, they have a haspartic
histidine cysteine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm teaching biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately I see this, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, this must be a cysteine-based
proteate, or deubiquinase, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we suddenly order all different
kids and test them in test tube to see
[SPEAKER_04]: whether or not we can detect any activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it turned out we cannot see any of
those activities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this kind of science just up and down
sometimes struggles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one struggle, another second
hit for us, because we have no idea what
[SPEAKER_04]: it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we thought, OK, maybe in a test tube,
we're not really know the endogenous
[SPEAKER_04]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know even the conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know when we should make the
function.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should do it in the cell and ask a
cell whether it was something,
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, something happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we do that, we have a sort of
idea maybe related to ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of co-transfer the cells with
the HA ubiquitin, either with the Y type
[SPEAKER_04]: or mutant proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we mutate the cysteine to
alanine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw the cysteine must be important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And immediately, you can see from the gel,
we brought the vestibular with HA to see
[SPEAKER_04]: the ubiquitin patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see some band only appears in
the Y type, but not in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mutant one, you see some band gets
appeared in the Y type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that immediately tells you this effect
must have something to do with the
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitination pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the help of my neighbor,
Mark Smoker, they do mass spec and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually they mass spec.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try to identify what are the
changes to ubiquitins in the substrate,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bands, the protein change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turned out, among the top 10 list,
seven of them actually relate to E1s and
[SPEAKER_04]: E2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out, so those in the cells,
you always have this ubiquitin chart E2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the presence of a CDC, this pool of
ubiquitin chart E2 was diminished,
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, and you can see this part
is gone, and that's why some enthalogen
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquination was inhibited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't have a supply of
ubiquitin chart E2.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why some bands, suppose you should
have, now it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, these enzymes or effectors,
they hijack ubiquitin, take over ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_04]: from this E2s and go to the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it can recruit its own substrates,
and the ubiquitin is its own substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now from this diagram or hypothesis,
you can see this actually functions as E3
[SPEAKER_04]: ligase.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hijacked host ubiquitins and do its
own ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with this idea, it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can confirm this during a test tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can see in the E1s, E2s,
and the E3s here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And immediately you can see the robust
ubiquitination happens with this E2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now with this E2, and with UBCG7,
it is so robust, almost all ubiquitin used
[SPEAKER_04]: up within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other E2s also function fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now that tells you, wow,
this is like a E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it comes to the next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the C2C should be placed here as an E3
ligase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we ask, this structure or protein
like a novel, how this can function as an
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 ligase?
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically we ask, how does the C2C can
recognize the E2s?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the E3 recognize E2 and take over
ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how they can transfer ubiquitin from
E2 to its substrate or C2C?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we continue with some mechanistic
studies with the structural, a solid
[SPEAKER_04]: variety of structures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see, it turned out that
there's a green domain here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it specifically recognized this E2,
which is shown in pink here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it's bind to E2s,
the ubiquitin, which is shown in yellow
[SPEAKER_04]: here, will be recruited to the active
site, which is here, and transfer
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin to the E3s and further on to its
own substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now with this, it turned out,
it sounds like this C2C or C2C,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are two of them actually,
parallel in the same bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just secrete it, and then find the
full structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this active site is covered by
the P4C domain, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not active probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then once it's secreted and sees the
PI4P, and this P4C domain will bind the
[SPEAKER_04]: PI4P and opens up the active site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can start ubiquitination some
substrates on the surface or nearby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll continue this later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before I do that, I will show you
another ubiquitin kind of pathways here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now as I go back to this here,
so now I just present to you our kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: identification of this HEC type E3
ligases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And recently, actually, there's another
family of this HEC effectors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my collaborator, Zhaoqing Luo's lab
from Purdue, they find that actually this
[SPEAKER_04]: full member family of this CDE family,
it also hijacked host ubiquitins.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it hijacked ubiquitins through a very
unique, bizarre way, as you can appreciate
[SPEAKER_04]: from the next slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it turned out that this is CDE,
the domain structure, and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: that no ubiquitin ligase domains or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, it has an ADP ribosyl transferase
domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it does, actually, is
specifically recognize ubiquitin and
[SPEAKER_04]: modify ubiquitin, use NAD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this process we call the phosphor
ribosylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So NAD can be used as substrate and then
attach phosphor ribose, sorry,
[SPEAKER_04]: ADP ribose to ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very specific and only to one relative,
arginine 42.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very unique, only ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only arginine 42 will be modified by this
domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the effector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a second domain called
the phosphodiester domain, PDE.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it does, actually, it further modify
or converts hydrolyzed AMP away from the
[SPEAKER_04]: ADP ribose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it left is a phosphor ribose
phosphate and attach the phosphate to its
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, you do this ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different from canonical
lysine-based isopetrophile linkage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is like a phosphor ribosyl ester
linkage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ubiquitin now attached to the
substrate, and also there's a phosphor
[SPEAKER_04]: ribose in bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we work out the mechanisms and figure
out how this enzyme can do this unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: we call it phosphor ribosyl ubiquination,
PI ubiquination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see from here, so this
enzyme cleaves the phosphate and release
[SPEAKER_04]: AMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the substrate coming activated by
this histidine, so this is serine
[SPEAKER_04]: residues, attack the phosphate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can see the formula linkage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ubiquitin now through the
arginine, through the pentose in the
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphate, attach it to the serine
residues on the substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we call the phosphor
ribosyl ubiquination.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turned out that there's four
of them, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of them can do the same thing,
can do this, which is called a phosphor
[SPEAKER_04]: ribosylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at the genomes of the
bacteria, so there's other five effectors
[SPEAKER_04]: contained as conservative PDE domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought, OK, you know, you look at
sequence, all the catalytic important
[SPEAKER_04]: residues are all identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought, OK, this PDE domain maybe can
do similar thing as do the ligations,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we just show you in previous slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it turned out now, then, can do the
ligations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But surprisingly to us, it did do the
reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of them can do the reverse of the PI
ubiquination, as you can see from this
[SPEAKER_04]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can generate this phosphor
ribosylate species here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is substrate, this is phosphor
ribosylate bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you incubate this phosphor ribosylate
species with this DAPA B, you can see all
[SPEAKER_04]: the ubiquitin form is gone, and another
mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly, so this DAPA A also
incubates, you all clean them up,
[SPEAKER_04]: use up, and another mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that tells you maybe this, too,
actually function to reverse the phosphor,
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse PI ubiquination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also true during infections,
as you can see from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do the infections.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see we can enrich the substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the wild-type infection,
you can detect some PI ubiquitin species.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you delete those two enzymes,
now you can see this PI ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate is really jumping high,
and then just substantially increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: Confirmed this indeed reverse function of
the D ubiquitinase, specifically for this
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphor ubiquination.
[SPEAKER_04]: To this point, I wonder if you can
appreciate, actually, this legionella
[SPEAKER_04]: secrete those ligases and do this unique
type phosphor, we call it phosphor ribosyl
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also secrete the stops to reverse
the activity, to cleave this PI
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin's final targets and recycle
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like canonical ubiquitin,
you have the ligases and the dobs,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the PI ubiquitin have similar
pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: To this point, actually, I have to
confess, I'm so guilty for one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: former students, because we saw that this
is really unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we find this in legionella species,
it's hard to believe the nature only
[SPEAKER_04]: created these pathways or cycles only in
one species, not in other organisms or
[SPEAKER_04]: other live species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought it must be some other lives
have this, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she spent quite a long time,
but would never detect any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymes in any other organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe implanted, we have it,
but we didn't really spend time on the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to believe only this
legionella have these pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, but this is not the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in top of this cycle, all this
pathways, the cyclical pathways,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's another layer of complexity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, if you look at the genomes again,
so this is the bacterial genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the A's and B's and the C's.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the ligases I just presented
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the B and the C, there's two other
genes nearby, in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually, in bacteria, so if the genes
form a cluster, they almost, they're
[SPEAKER_04]: probably likely in the same pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably regulated in the same
regular or whatever they spread together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, if you look at what they are,
one of them is the top A, which I just
[SPEAKER_04]: showed you is the D.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another one called the C to J.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly, so C to J actually can
rescue the top surprise activity of this
[SPEAKER_04]: A, B, C, the ligases, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ligases, when you express the
yeast, and they are toxic, they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when you co-express C to J,
now it regulates the toxic, rescues the
[SPEAKER_04]: toxic, but now it can grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to cut it short, because there are
too many, too much stories behind this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it turned out this, here again,
we're showing the pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of these pathways, this C to J
constitutes another regulatory pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the secreted and the bind host,
the comodulin, the activator, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: modified CDE, and the inhibit activity of
the CDE.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, we call it glutamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, there's other factors that
can recycle this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, we have this pathway,
and on top of that, you also have a
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory circuit to control the
activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there's many labs
contributing to this, including ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really a new pathway, and that's
why many, a lot of papers come out almost
[SPEAKER_04]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, to this point, I just introduce it
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this canonical between the
pathways, and we have this unique PR
[SPEAKER_04]: between the pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to ask whether or not these
two different pathways, are they totally
[SPEAKER_04]: independent, or they can cross talk with
each other?
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why we ask this, is there are
two folds, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when doing infections,
we do detect a lot of ubiquitin signals at
[SPEAKER_04]: the surface of LCV, when infected with a
wide type of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another mutant, and if you delete either
CDE family or C to C family, those
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin-positive vacuums are
significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, both of these two family
ligases contribute to ubiquitin signals at
[SPEAKER_04]: the surface of the LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, another fold of evidence,
the reason is why we saw that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: cross-talking each other, because they
modify similar substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both, for example, RAB1 has been
shown, can be both modified by the PR
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitination pathways, and the canonical
ubiquitin pathways, too, as it's showing
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see, even during infections,
you can see this substrate being
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitinated, you delete either families,
it's reduced, deleted both, it's almost
[SPEAKER_04]: all gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now we ask, if this function
together and modify the same substrates,
[SPEAKER_04]: what kind of ubiquitin structures or
chains accumulate or build up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: substrates?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we saw that, here we come up with this
kind of model, we saw that C to C can
[SPEAKER_04]: build up a canonical ubiquitin chains,
which are directly attached to the
[SPEAKER_04]: substrates, and the CDE, they do this PR
ubiquitination, and again, attach to the
[SPEAKER_04]: same substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this also ubiquitin molecule,
ubiquitin also has lysines available,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can be further ubiquitinated by C to
C, that's why they probably can continue
[SPEAKER_04]: to build up in the elongated ubiquitin
chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this type of ubiquitin kind of
structures, we kind of hypothesize that
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe happens in the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to test this model, we now,
we can do this in vitro in the test table,
[SPEAKER_04]: also in vivo in the cells, so you can
enrich or accumulate this ubiquitin in the
[SPEAKER_04]: substrates, and then treat it with a
canonical DAB, which will cleave all the
[SPEAKER_04]: isopeptide bond and link ubiquitin,
so you're free up ubiquitin, but only left
[SPEAKER_04]: this phosphor ribose ubiquitin chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also treat it with another
enzyme, DAPHB, which I just showed you,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a specific cleaves PRUB linkage,
and then if you do that, now this
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin will still maintain attached to
the substrates, and that will be released
[SPEAKER_04]: with a different length of ubiquitin
chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the kind of predictions,
and we do the experiment, and test whether
[SPEAKER_04]: this is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So marina synthesizes this ubiquitin
species with both enzymes, and indeed
[SPEAKER_04]: after treated with DAPH, you see the
marina ubiquitin, which is here,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some ubiquitin is maintained,
which correspond to this substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you treat it with DAPHB,
you see the marina ubiquitin, di
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin, a little bit of poly,
which correspond to this part,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you have more ubiquitin chains
attached to the substrate, which
[SPEAKER_04]: correspond to this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then certainly if you treat it with
both enzymes, you all clasp into marina
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin, and almost all gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So indeed, so those ubiquitin,
you have two enzymes that build up this
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of ubiquitin chain, mixed ubiquitin
chain we call.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the cells, you have this more
mixed ubiquitin chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we know in the cells,
we have autophagy machineries,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can detect those ubiquitins and send
this for autophagy degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually happening in the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bacteria is not that stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know actually, they know how to avoid
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this ubiquitin, this should be
recognized by ubiquitin adapters,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it can be degraded by the autophagy
pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: To ask this, we kind of go back to the
activity of these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this can do the pure ubiquitin
ligations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes in the absence of a
substrate, in the presence of water
[SPEAKER_04]: molecules, they actually do the cleavage
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, if this phosphor was cleaved by
water molecules, it will left a phosphor
[SPEAKER_04]: ribose attached to ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So which means this ubiquitin probably be
modified by CDE with the phosphor ribose
[SPEAKER_04]: on RGN42.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by these modifications, you may kind
of mask ubiquitins and block the
[SPEAKER_04]: recognition by the host ubiquitin
adapters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first, we'll verify this, whether or
not this is true, this ubiquitin be
[SPEAKER_04]: modified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, we have ubiquitin chains
synthesized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can use a, we call it
phosphor protein queue staining.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only detect the phosphate attached
to the proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, those ubiquitin chains are
light up, lights up, indicating in the
[SPEAKER_04]: presence of the CDE, SDA, or CDE.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indicating those, indeed, those ubiquitins
be modified with the pentose phosphate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, it's true in vivo, and in vitro,
or in vivo, both is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may use the ubiquitin substrates,
and we cleave them with a dot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, we can analyze the ubiquitins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, those ubiquitin you can see in the
presence of a CDE, SDA, CDE, which
[SPEAKER_04]: basically, you can see this ubiquitin be
modified.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also confirm it is masked
back, and this is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those ubiquitin be modified.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they can prevent binding
recognition by the ubiquitin adapters,
[SPEAKER_04]: and prevent autophagy degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, if you look at ubiquitin
binding by this adapter proteins,
[SPEAKER_04]: UVA domain, bind ubiquitin and arginine-42
right at the interface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can imagine with arginine-42 be
modified with ADP ribose or phosphoribose,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's steric collisions here,
this block the binding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, when you do the binding
assays, you can see if the ubiquitin be
[SPEAKER_04]: modified, there's no binding here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, this ubiquitin actually can be
pulled down by the UVA domains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, when you're doing infections,
it's too complicated, just focus on the
[SPEAKER_04]: two lanes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ubiquitin species is a lot,
but yet there's no P62 bind to this
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin species.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you delete the CDE family, even though
the ubiquitin species are being reduced
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatically, you can still see dramatic
binding with P62.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also consistent with the
imaging data.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see why type of infection is a no
to be recruited to the LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by you delete the CDE ubiquitin,
a P62 positive LCV is significantly
[SPEAKER_04]: increased here, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm going to speed it up a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to this end, so now this actually we
understand now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of ubiquitin sequence chain
is built up at the surface of LCV,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this ubiquitin actually is mixed,
and also ubiquitin moiety is being
[SPEAKER_04]: modified.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they can prevent the host
recognition, prevent the autophagy
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you may ask, why you need this?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have ubiquitin, it's not
going to be detected by autophagy anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why you needed this ubiquitin built up
at the surface, and then modify them to
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent recognition?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there must be some physiological
functions associated with this ubiquitin,
[SPEAKER_04]: this mixed ubiquitin chain here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, actually, when we do the
infections, if you look at the recruitment
[SPEAKER_04]: of ER material or ER vesicles to the LCV
in a Y type, OK, you can detect a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the, sorry, a lot of LCVs are positive for
those ER materials, ER markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you delete either of these two family
of ligases, those ER markers will be
[SPEAKER_04]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to both of them even reduce it to
almost the same number to the dot A
[SPEAKER_04]: mutant, which totally block the secretion
of the effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that tells you, sounds like this
ubiquitin chain, so you build up the
[SPEAKER_04]: surface, also serves as a kind of a
recruiting mechanism to recruit ER
[SPEAKER_04]: vesicles to the LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, now if you go back to this
model, so this, you can imagine this
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin chain built up, and actually
ubiquitin within the chain, maybe they can
[SPEAKER_04]: use that to cross-link a second substrate,
so there's phosphoribosyl linkage.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this ubiquitin attached to this first
substrate, which anchored the LCV,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this one anchored the ER vesicles,
so now you can imagine this ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_04]: chain serves as anchoring molecules and
bridge up together two different proteins
[SPEAKER_04]: and bridge the vesicles recruited to the
LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just cut in the short, indeed
actually probably is true, because we can
[SPEAKER_04]: detect those cross-linking of the two
different substrate within the same
[SPEAKER_04]: ubiquitin chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can basically, you can do the
infections, you can pull down one
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate, you can also detect the second
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you do the cleavages,
you can release the second substrate in
[SPEAKER_04]: free.
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, when you do this assays,
we just focus on these two layers here,
[SPEAKER_04]: so this ubiquitin species, it's also
positive for the second substrates,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you do the cleavage, you can see
the second substrate was released on the
[SPEAKER_04]: same material here, either with dub A,
or dub, or conic dub, or dub B.
[SPEAKER_04]: So either one, you can release the second
substrate from the ubiquitin species.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so certainly, whether or not this
ubiquitin chain serves as an anchor still
[SPEAKER_04]: needs more evidence, more experiments,
we're continuing to investigate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the way, I will stop here and just
summarize what we have done so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already told you this back here,
I secrete many, many factors, and they can
[SPEAKER_04]: really, they're the best cell biology than
us, and they know everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can manipulate the lipids and
manipulate the acting cytoskeleton and
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria, which I'm still working on,
and I present to you more in details about
[SPEAKER_04]: the two ubiquitin pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these two ubiquitin pathways function
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They build up sort of a mixed ubiquitin
chains, like a meshwork on the surface of
[SPEAKER_04]: LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only they can protect the bacteria
from host degradation, but also probably
[SPEAKER_04]: can serve as an anchoring scaffold to
recruit host materials or ER vesicles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And OK, by the end, I will see some
people's, I can actually, I do see,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the former members and some new
members, and I don't have time to go into
[SPEAKER_04]: details, so sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also some collaborators and the
fundings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will stop here, and hopefully it's
not too late, and I welcome any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You showed target for RAP23.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that really a target?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that a target?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea why RAP23 should be
degraded, as opposed to being a partner?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any other target for this
effect, or?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do any of these proteins have any role
towards 236S protozoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm not clear with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out this ubiquitin is not for
protein degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose is not for degrading any
proteins around LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally not for degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of substrate, we didn't mess
back with both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both CDCs and SDAs, you will see numerous
of effectors, which many of these actually
[SPEAKER_04]: are ER proteins and some proteins involved
in memory trafficking, like a RAPs,
[SPEAKER_04]: more GTPases, and then many others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also some of the substrate
that are kind of common for each ligases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we believe there's no specificity for
those targets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more likely that based on the
geometry, based on the space, based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of those enzymes, they're
secreted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all localized on the surface of LCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever protein nearby, they can be
modified.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the modification is not for
degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they probably just build up
ubiquitin mashable as a protecting shell,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also serve as, as I mentioned,
as anchoring scaffold and then recruit
[SPEAKER_04]: other proteins, cross-linking other
proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that answer you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why some initial vesicle can be
recruited through other mechanism,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this ubiquitin modified them and
stabilized them and anchored them more
[SPEAKER_04]: tightly through like a covalent mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just attach them together.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that E3 ligase can serve as
like a recruiter or like the ubiquitin can
[SPEAKER_03]: serve as a recruiter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do Puginella do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like why do they need ER to be there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why they recruit ER?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the bacteria need to grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When they enter the cell, initially the
phagosome is very tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really tightly bound to only the
bacteria inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, as I mentioned, 24 hours,
expanding enormously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like two thirds of the cells are occupied
by this vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a membrane, you need materials to
enlarge the space, enlarge the niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more like the lipid transfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's probably one of the
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recruiting ER vesicles, you can infuse
them eventually, and the bigger,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never looked at it yet, but maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea yet, and nobody reported
any lipid transfer protein involved in
[SPEAKER_04]: this process or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: That suddenly could be a future direction
for you to investigate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I understand quite well your
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you repeat it again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea whether or not it
interferes with other host ubiquitination
[SPEAKER_04]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, what I presented here is just
utilize ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hijacks host ubiquitin and uses it for
its own build-up of this ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_04]: meshwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cycling or other ubiquitin pathways
during infections, I don't know to what
[SPEAKER_04]: degree they're impacted by this ubiquitin
ligases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, the infection cycle is quite
short, like 24 hours, you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure it can affect the cell
cycles or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we use, let's say, these proteins that
hijack the ubiquitin to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: treat cancer or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it will not let the cyclins to
degrade, and the cell will remain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought when I work on this,
we call it weapons.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are really unique tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use it to dissect the host cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: But somehow, those enzymes are quite toxic
to the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you overexpress them, the host is not
happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell is going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, for example, this is really
robust.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you overexpress too much in the cells,
it just uses up all ubiquitin and just
[SPEAKER_04]: hijacks everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly, this ligase is also a
toxifying ubiquitination system,
[SPEAKER_04]: indulging ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it could be, if you use a small
amount, you can directly use it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can dissect a user.
[SPEAKER_04]: To manipulate it in different ways as you
wish.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fascinating talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm intrigued by the fact that the CIDC
and CIDA are basically only found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think their evolutionary
origin is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, usually people believe those genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bacteria are acquired from the
original Haitian host.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we call it a gene transfer,
a horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now through evolution, this evolved in
the whole bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the sequence and all the other
features maybe evolve some new ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But totally different from the eukaryotic
host.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally different now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot see any sequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even structure-wise, you don't see them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but how did nature create those?
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether or not, again, this is still
puzzling me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether or not maybe other species have
this answer or not, we still have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know several labs try to investigate
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody reported so far whether or not
other species have those pathway or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe plant has it, I hope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, plant pathway maybe also has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
