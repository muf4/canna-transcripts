[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Mary Ulrich with Quinoa Cooperative
Extension in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I too am on the hemp team and I'm going to
address a little bit about risk and reward
[SPEAKER_00]: because of course the question this year
is the reward of hemp, the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: profit, balance out with the risk because
those two things should be in direct
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion to one another but they may not
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so has hemp been all rainbows and
kittens or is it a little wild westy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of wild westy out there in
the last couple of years and so I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to address a couple of ways to protect
yourself from the bad actors and other
[SPEAKER_00]: potential negatives that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is risk measured and mitigated?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we use cost of production data.
[SPEAKER_00]: John mentioned that it's coming along but
the future market certainly is
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly do need more interest from
consumers to keep that price up,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the demand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also mitigate risk with crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the payments,
I haven't talked to anybody who signed up
[SPEAKER_00]: for crop insurance and I mean the USDA FSA
crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what those payments are
going to be for 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: My prediction last year was that they were
either going to be really good or really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad and so we'll see what happens with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always curious to talk to people
who've had insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've had insurance please give me
a ring because private or the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government supported ones that would be,
I'd love that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and also one way to protect yourself or
to mitigate risk is to have a contract and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course with the 2018 Farm Bill going to
be brought into effect in New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of changes in the landscape
happening and of course we're not used to
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation changing so quickly around
crops but the last few years this has been
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a little roller coaster so that in
itself is a risk that you don't know where
[SPEAKER_00]: things are going to go legislatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the big force majeure or the big
risk is that FDA may decide to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop particularly in the case of CBD
and that could have a huge impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If FDA said no no this is a drug and
everybody has to have just like a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has to have the same kind of
testing and monitoring then there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of producers and processors that
would no longer have a market because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't meet those requirements and so
the other thing I just want to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts you know if it sounds too good
to be true it probably is and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you a flyer in a minute that can help
you out in terms of contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the biggest thing that I see as
a problem with hemp contracts or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships right now is that there's no
collective knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For produce we have the blue book so the
people can go look up buyers in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buyers are bonded so that if a seller
doesn't get paid they can go to the state
[SPEAKER_00]: and get reimbursed through that bonding
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they really didn't get paid for
something that they sold and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: was supposed to be okay and the seller
just didn't get their money there's a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it back but in hemp that doesn't
exist right now and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: institutional memory which we should have
or we have in other businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who is going to pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who the traditional bad actors
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the guys who pay in 30,
60, 90 and the ones who don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know your neighbors do and so
sharing information about that in other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops is been very open and hemp it has
not been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even what little institutional memory
is being gathered it's not being shared
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it seems like bad actors are going
from farm to farm or from region to region
[SPEAKER_00]: and causing trouble and certainly this
isn't just about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it happen that folks selling
grain came to me because they didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for their grain because the buyer
said that it was moldy but didn't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them it was moldy until like three months
later so the there's no way to trace back
[SPEAKER_00]: who's fault that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just very unfortunate and so also
very unusual relationships between value
[SPEAKER_00]: and cost that the farmer needs to buy into
the processing somehow which is really you
[SPEAKER_00]: know not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean spray you know really doesn't need
the farmers necessarily to buy into the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing part itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be a co-op in terms of selling
but do they own the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not or orange juice companies or any
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't that same kind of need to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest from people who
have never been involved in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also what I call the billionaire
rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of folks running around
saying oh I have billionaire friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well unless you see a picture of him with
Warren Buffett like on his Christmas card
[SPEAKER_00]: don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the local growers actually said
if it's a good party it'll still be good
[SPEAKER_00]: going in a couple of years and if it's a
bad party I never want to go in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that one question about why he was
because he was going to grow and then
[SPEAKER_00]: changed his mind in the last minute and 19
and so just using caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try and look more closely at some of
those contract details there's this six
[SPEAKER_00]: page pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two pages are about production
stuff but then the next four about
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it with the assistance of several
attorneys, agricultural attorneys and so
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on both the Cornell website and the
hemp blog which here's the pages and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the blog is on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like and so there's
regular news updates there and updates for
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the link for the contracting
and on the right don't forget that Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: has its own website and then the team
whether it's other people you've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: from today or John or Lindsay or myself
all of our contact information is also on
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the team website.
