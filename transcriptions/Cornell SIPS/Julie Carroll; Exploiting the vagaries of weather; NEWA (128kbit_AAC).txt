[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been the leader of NUA for about
10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is NUA?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a knowledge network, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers share data through the network,
providing us with feedback and guidance of
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use that data and better present it
on the web to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather data is collected every 15
minutes and tabulated in hourly and daily
[SPEAKER_00]: summary tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collecting precipitation,
temperature, dew point temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, leaf wetness, solar radiation,
wind speed, and wind direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the company that provides the
weather instruments, Rainwise
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporated, has allowed people to add
two optional sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most popular, shall we say,
are soil temperature and soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designate sister stations within the
network to plug in data where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: missing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, for instance, if we're
accumulating degree days, we don't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: oops, a week or so of missing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the degree day value would be
erroneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we extrapolate one hour gaps in our
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what we're doing is we're
creating, with that data, decision support
[SPEAKER_00]: tools for IPM and crop prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about NUA's history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created in 1996 by Kurt Petzoldt,
who was the vegetable IPM coordinator in
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York State IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started out as an association with
membership levels, different pay
[SPEAKER_00]: membership levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it's free access with land grant
and grower support to provide some
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We initially were using sensor and grower
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using Campbell instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensor was bought by a company called
Sensotronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those stations became obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we've got Rainwise Incorporated
weather instruments, onset instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We serve up airport location data,
as well as state climatology mesonets
[SPEAKER_00]: through our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we were going out and manually
downloading the data from computers,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that data into a fax, and faxing
that information out to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we were recording messages on what was
called a coda phone, for those of you who
[SPEAKER_00]: might remember those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then growers could dial that number
and find out what the report du jour was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we went to modems, and we were
collecting data every day and serving it
[SPEAKER_00]: up on a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we've got a few instruments that are
still connected in through file transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol, or FTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to phase that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwise wrote that software for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority are connected in through the
internet, through an internet interface
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes with the weather instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rainwise just launched a cellular data
plan and has a cellular modem instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have, as of yesterday or the day
before, 375 active weather stations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a total is probably pushing closer
to 400, but they come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're taken out for maintenance or
what have you, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are instruments on the ground
collecting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a footprint in 20 states,
primarily in the East, Northeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and into the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 10 member states plus some
individual members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers in non-member states can now join.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NUA is open access, providing data in
real time, query-based decision support
[SPEAKER_00]: models with built-in biofix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the ability of growers to enter their
own biofix information for the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The models are interactive with a user
interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to give you a snapshot of the
home page, nua.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like the sequencing slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the key is that there's a
blue menu that follows you throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can access weather data,
pest forecasts, station pages,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop management models, and some crop
pages that we have to serve up IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: information and other information of use
to the grower, as well as some information
[SPEAKER_00]: about weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a grower wanted to buy a weather
instrument, they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would be able to learn how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue menu on the website provides the
interactive tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a neat thing that I've used quite a
bit is up here in the corner is a National
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather Service little query box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put in your city and state,
hit Go, and you'll go to the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather Service site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to find out what the
forecast is for your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of now, as many of you know,
the internet knows where you are at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Big Brother is watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map will save to your location
and center the next time you come in on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of you millennials and stuff,
that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people like me, it's like,
ah, somebody knows where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it's kind of cool,
because then it basically centers the map
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to move it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are station pages for every weather
station in the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these provide quick links to tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are built on default biophysics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on historic records that
faculty have for apple insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: grape phenology stages, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or typical planting dates for onions or
potatoes, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although these aren't interactive,
you can still get to the interactive
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are quick links for degree days,
daily and hourly summaries, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: PestForecast quick links.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a lat-lon elevation,
tells you the station sensors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last good download date that occurred
at that station location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a snapshot of NUA's
current map.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed this snippet off the website,
I think, again, day before yesterday or
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is zoomed in here on New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the entire map here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows that we're now reaching into
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got individuals in the Plains,
Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most recently, Virginia became a
member and North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're moving to the south, which kind
of makes for a little nail biting of,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the models really useful down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of discussion with the
faculty that are requesting expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA to make sure that it's going to be
applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why am I here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, number one, I contacted Jeff and I
said, hey, Jeff, can I give a seminar on
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's been telling me I got to get
the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to tell Cornell University
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, OK, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how might NUA benefit programs in soil
and crop sciences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, NUA basically now is operating the
weather stations on your research farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Aurora station, the Willsboro station,
and the station at Shea Z Miner are the
[SPEAKER_00]: stations that are on your research farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musgrave Research Farm, Willsboro Research
Farm, and WH Miner Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked with the Cornell
facilities, the Cornell Ag Experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the New York State Ag Experiment
Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the Cornell University Ag
Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working with the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the facilities director to get these
weather stations plugged in on the various
[SPEAKER_00]: research farms that Cornell operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we really don't have very many
tools for agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have an alfalfa weevil tool that is
built on a degree day model that Ray
[SPEAKER_00]: Carruthers developed back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, we've got a number of
degree days that I think might be of use
[SPEAKER_00]: to agronomic crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two main reasons that I'm here,
one is to stimulate your thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: developing and utilizing NUA to benefit
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How might that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your vision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to raise awareness of what NUA
has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to that end, I'm going to give you a
little sampling of the predictive models
[SPEAKER_00]: or what is increasingly, these are being
called tools now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always used to call them models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I say models or tools, you'll know
that it's a transition transitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got phenology models for plant
diseases and insects, crop management
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, and weather products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're real-time, query-based,
decision support with built-in biofix or
[SPEAKER_00]: an interactive user interface where they
can enter the biofix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pest forecast menu right here
off of the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we've got 14 plant disease
tools, 11 insect phenology tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are now increasingly, most of them
are providing a five-day forecast look
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future so that a grower can
prepare if they know they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: at risk for a certain disease or insect
developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get their spray set up and go out
and apply that spray in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can assess that risk, learn IPM info,
and get decision support through these
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gives you a snippet of the
grape forecast models that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: in NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the models that are served up on
the website have a little utility here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left-hand side of the page where you
would select a disease or insect for
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is on one page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would select, we have grape berry
moth, grape diseases, or DMCAST,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a simulation model for grapevine
downy mildew available from this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are building now because we're in so
many states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a state, select the state,
and then the weather station location is
[SPEAKER_00]: selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We default to the current date,
but you can go back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can select a historic date as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I needed to do that to create
this snippet by going back to last spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first go onto the page,
the map tab is active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know the weather station
location, when you select the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: here will be the image of the map
centered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can zoom in on that so that you
can then decide, well, I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the geographic region I'm
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click on the icon on the map,
and the name of the weather station
[SPEAKER_00]: location plugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've decided your ending date,
you hit Calculate, and the results pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Results tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have fact sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information on how to use the model more
effectively, that type of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the More Info tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see a pretty common format
that we use is a table showing the two
[SPEAKER_00]: past days, the current date, and the
forecast days.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this one, we actually tabulate three
diseases of grapes, fomopsis, powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, and black rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of information about those
models is here, what the models are doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're calculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower can change the phenological
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're estimating that 10-inch shoot growth
is where we're at on May 29th of last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on Concord, a variety of
grapes that is grown for juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the largest number of
acreage of any variety of grapes grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this region, most growers are
growing wine grape varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be growing shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chardonnay, Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can change the phenological
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is my colleague in IPM was
telling me, we were talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: spring is kind of, we're all nail biting,
because spring is here, and yet it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that can happen is
you can go from three-inch shoot growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes to 12-inch shoot growth in grapes
in a matter of three days, if it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this gives flexibility to the
model, and changing this may change the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease management messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these go, you would scroll down the
page, and then you would get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease management messages for each of
the diseases in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you a perspective on how
most of the models work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the crop management tools that we
have, not that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three, primarily focused around
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, again, are assessing risk,
providing decision support, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily are focused on crop load
management, irrigation, and freeze risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Cornell apple carbohydrate
thinning model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's the utility on the left to
enter the weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have the state selection soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current date, or the date of interest,
would be selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results tab will show up, and the
grower would enter their green tip date.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Hudson Valley, we're already at
green tip in apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet in the Lake Ontario region,
thankfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would enter their bloom date,
and then there's a button here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would click calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This table then builds below this utility
to provide these data related to the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the carbohydrate status,
starting from the green tip date down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the current date that you've selected,
which is the green row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light blue rows above, tan rows below are
building the forecast down in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below this is the carbohydrate
balance of the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end user can scroll along this,
and little pop-up boxes will show up
[SPEAKER_00]: saying the date and the carbohydrate
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving basically what is being shown at
that point on that graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take-home message for your purposes is
if the tree is in deficit, if it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate balance deficit, it's going
to be easier for the grower to thin the
[SPEAKER_00]: apples off the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to reduce their thinner rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the carbohydrate balance is on the
positive side, on the plus side,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be harder to thin the apples
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree has a lot of reserved
carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hang on to all that
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be able to ripen that
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be harder to thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this model does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell them to either increase
the chemical thinner rate or decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical thinner rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This model is probably the biggest driver
in terms of end users putting weather
[SPEAKER_00]: stations on their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is huge in terms of crop quality,
crop value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thin your crop too much,
you don't have a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you under thin, you don't grow premium
quality apples that are big and bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: premium price.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new utility that was developed
by Arte Gaitano at the Northeast Regional
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Center that is estimating two-inch
soil temperature across the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tools that are developed by the
Climate Center provide outputs like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're color-coded maps that generate
this graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here as of two days ago,
the soils were warming in the Hudson
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley, but they were still kind of cold
in the Adirondacks, up in Maine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to a certain extent along Lake
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the weather products that
you might be interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the weather product menu,
what I've done is I've highlighted this
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is new as of this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just rewrote the degree day calculator
that Arte Agnello and I had created about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, 12 years ago or so,
eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we migrated our database,
the programming language wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just kind of resurrected this and
we're really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, under weather data,
you can get degree day tables for 11 base
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and they accumulate from
January 1st, March 1st, April 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: and May 1st, again, based on end user
requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These base temperatures usually are
borrowed from the models that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've built in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, this 32 is for apple scab
ascospora maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 4C is for cabbage maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bizarre one is for great berry moth
because the research was done in degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade and the translation ended up
being, you know, 47.14 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will serve up our hourly data in
tables, summarized, and these are month by
[SPEAKER_00]: month tables, providing daily summary
tables, and then again, the degree day
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll spend a little bit more time on
this because I think this is an area that
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing and I've been explaining this
to our end users and they're seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: important this can be to document issues
that have occurred if they've particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: got crop insurance or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be able to document them and
print them off or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a mild winter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a mild winter except for
Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a significant freeze event on
Valentine's Day and in Highland,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, which is in the Hudson Valley,
the data logger, the weather station
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the hourly data, you can see how the
tables are presented and you can see each
[SPEAKER_00]: hour how cold it got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the daily summary table for
this same event, you'll see how the
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum was minus 10.6 degrees Fahrenheit
with fairly cold weather each day
[SPEAKER_00]: preceding and after that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, it was actually really
mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleagues in the Hudson Valley have
been out cutting buds on peach and sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry and pretty much the peach crop down
there is toast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the flower buds were killed and
the sweet cherries, the jury is still out
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again, it gives the grower a
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can look back in time and see how
cold did it get for how long to know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether their crop, whether particular
varieties that they know are hardy or not
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy were damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
when we talk about severe rain events,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down giving a talk in North
Carolina, which again is a new partner for
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA and I said, hey, you know,
what was a weird event that occurred that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go back and grab the data and
share with the growers and show them how
[SPEAKER_00]: they can access that and they said,
my gosh, we got like five inches of rain
[SPEAKER_00]: in three days in October and we were
trying to harvest and it was impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: and we couldn't get out to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and sure enough, this weather
station that went in last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hendersonville, North Carolina,
went to the all weather data utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really should say October,
but I think I was just too lazy to update
[SPEAKER_00]: it for the purposes of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the October data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hourly table for that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a third of an inch of rain
to almost a half of an inch of rain was
[SPEAKER_00]: being logged by the tipping bucket every
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at the daily
summary, sure enough, there's that five
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what might have fallen on the
30th of September, but I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to patch that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these tabulate by month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't get out to harvest their
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that fruit starts to drop and
there's a lot of crop loss associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do and what have we been doing
to try to build capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: As of 2010, we lost all of our funding
support for NUA and it was coincidental
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of my colleagues in New England
wanted to join NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it presented with a challenge and
an opportunity at the same time that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could build this partnership and they
could help fund NUA and sustain it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our partners, including the Northeast
Regional Climate Center and Rainwise
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporated, were also absolutely
essential during that downturn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Northeast Regional Climate Center
partners with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They house the NUA climate database.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide model programming into the PI
design tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principal investigator decides what
they want this tool to be and they help
[SPEAKER_00]: the programmer decide how to program it
with the data that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide data quality control,
meteorological expertise and guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing is that they have a
high level of interest in agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: applications of climate data, as many of
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have also helped us create automated
outage reports that go out to weather
[SPEAKER_00]: station contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have gotten a lot of emails back
that initially I thought, oh no,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're telling them their weather station
is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, they're really
excited about getting that report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our slide of partners and,
you know, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to get really crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two apple grower associations,
one in Minnesota, one in North Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: that partner with NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State, Rutgers, University of
Connecticut, University of Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: and University of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our partners in this year, New Hampshire
and Virginia Tech have joined.
[SPEAKER_00]: These partners pay $17.50 per year to be
members of NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our subscription fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwise Incorporated has been a fantastic
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have helped even with software
programming, putting leaf wetness sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: onto their stations and developing their
stations so that they actually fit the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a, just so you know,
it's the menu for the about weather
[SPEAKER_00]: stations and a snapshot of the weather
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leaf wetness sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It currently actually is attached over
here to the tipping bucket so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: facing north at a 45 degree angle,
which has been shown to be the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this chart is pretty exciting and also
a bit daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became lead in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: We launched the current website that I've
shown you in 2009 and the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments in the system has just grown
significantly over these last seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have 10 statewide members and
individual farms and actually it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: five other states because one of those
states is now one of the 10 statewide
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ingest airport data and we've put into
place a humidity correction factor because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the situation in terms of the
microclimate near an airport is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different from an agricultural field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a relative humidity correction
factor and we also have a leaf wetness
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate in place for those stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're partnering with the state
climatologist in New Jersey for their
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this green bar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of growth in the number of
weather stations over the last seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farmers and multipliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have the individual farms in
Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil and water conservation districts have
written grants to fund small mesonets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mesonet funded by them in Seneca
County in the wine grape growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: County and regional extension programs
have partnered with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk County on Long Island,
probably most notable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have about 20 or more weather
stations in their network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, primarily on vineyards but also on
apple farms and in vegetable potato fields
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of arboretums and
wilderness areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the airport locations and state
climatology mesonets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially crowd sourcing our
data and pulling it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The priorities of our stakeholders we pay
pretty close attention to and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable funding for most of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how crucial that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to rebuild our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going on seven years old now and it
would be nice for it to be responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever size your screen was or your
device was, it would adjust for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have more weather station
locations and one way to do that very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly would be to use the national
digital forecast database of gridded data
[SPEAKER_00]: and serve up virtual station locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our end users would like apps that reside
on their phone that could interface with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alerts and alarms for frost, heat events,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd also like for us to be able to
cache their biofix data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more models and tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Station maintenance and troubleshooting
has been a big emphasis of mine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year and a half because of a funded
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm here to promote awareness
because so many of them have been saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie, you've got to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get out and tell the story
about NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of research and development,
on weather data we developed the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: wetness estimator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the simplest and least prone
to errors on the negative or positive side
[SPEAKER_00]: was using an hour with relative humidity
above 90% as well as an any hour that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be raining, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artigaitano has written and done research
on data quality control for precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he finds that a tipping bucket
has either over recorded or under recorded
[SPEAKER_00]: rain as based on what the gridded data is
saying around that instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will send an email out to them saying,
hey, we think there's something wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: your tipping bucket rain gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we'd like to build these virtual
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do, we can compare back and
forth between the on the ground data and
[SPEAKER_00]: the virtual data.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really nice fertile ground of research
would be developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard from Abby Seaman just
yesterday or the day before that she and
[SPEAKER_00]: Artigaitano are going to be looking at
that soil temperature estimate map and
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing that to sensors actually placed
in different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can see whether there's an impact
of soil type on that estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking at an eNUA email alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We beta tested this with apples in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been running for three years now
with grape growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like to develop this into a
subscription-based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially for any location they choose,
they can get the email at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get the time of their choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives them the results of the
models basically in an email format.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to go into the website and
click and click to get the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that degree day calculator that
basically you put the start date and the
[SPEAKER_00]: end date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll give you the degree day
accumulation for that range of dates for
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular location.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote a grant recently to develop a
cache for end user inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: First trap catch dates, green tip dates,
blossom dates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it wasn't funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to remain on the drawing
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had this in a grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this also, we did not get that grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Artigaitano and the Climate Smart
Farming Group are moving forward on this
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still on the drawing board on
the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Responsive web design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently upping the vegetable and
apple insect tools, all the vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, with the five-day forecast data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the apple fire blight tool,
we're incorporating an epiphytic infection
[SPEAKER_00]: potential from a third-party software
called Mary Blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art Agnello has written a San Jose scale
model for apples that should go into be
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a workshop with apple growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were looking at the apple
irrigation model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became clear that we've got some
work to do on that model based on some
[SPEAKER_00]: input from that workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always open to end user
suggestions for improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last six months, we've
created a wish list of over 40 different
[SPEAKER_00]: models that are out there in the
literature and the scientific literature
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could incorporate into this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA is transforming weather information
and knowledge into tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are being able to share resources
for weather data collection, analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, archiving, through
integration of all these networks via
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud computing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pushing forecasts out five days in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we even launched this website,
before we even grew to where we are today,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did a survey in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked growers in New York that were
using NUA, and these were apple,
[SPEAKER_00]: grape, onion, and potato growers
primarily, whether using NUA tools reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays, improved spray timing,
alerted of pest risk, or enhanced IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And virtually all of them agreed or
strongly agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, if it's a bad year for
diseases, you won't get that reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: spray, because if it's rainy and wet all
season long, you're going to be chasing
[SPEAKER_00]: that disease all season long.
[SPEAKER_00]: These same growers reported on average
that they could save $19,500 per year in
[SPEAKER_00]: spray costs, and that was 2007 costs,
and save $264,000 per year in crop loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are high-value horticultural
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of end users of NUA at that time would
recommend NUA use to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that underlines why this has
been so popular and why it has grown so
[SPEAKER_00]: much in recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have over 2 million page views per
year in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the NUA site almost every day early
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orchard was largely scab-free for the
first time in several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager depended heavily on NUA and
could see differences between their
[SPEAKER_00]: on-site station and the one they had been
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two New Jersey growers of apples last year
had the best thinning results ever using
[SPEAKER_00]: our tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outcomes are better IPM,
reduced pesticide use, improved
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental protection, better crop
management, improved crop quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: improved yield, and definitely enhanced
decision support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, we've got some new
partners and some new directions to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just recently embarked on a
partnership with EnviroWeather,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a similar program based at
Michigan State University, and I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: call-in to talk this up and see how we can
move forward to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have models they want, and they have
models we want and could really benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been embarking on conversations with
two other state climatology mesonets,
[SPEAKER_00]: North Carolina's Econet and Delaware's
DEOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably killed the pronunciation of
that, but D-E-O-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: A New York state mesonet is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may be aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 125 weather stations are going in across
New York funded with FEMA dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to Hurricane Sandy, Tropical
Storm Irene, and I think Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are also discussing with the mesonet
on how we can partner in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Climate Smart Farming Group,
part of the Cornell Institute for Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Change and Agriculture, is another area
that's ripe for collaboration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll be partnering with them and
discussing how to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also been discussing how we can
partner with AgRadar at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our stakeholder objectives,
we keep these closely in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about pretty much all of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a new data product for
third-party software called RimPro,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we just launched that this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may bring in some revenue for that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to create a developer
sandbox so that developers could go in on
[SPEAKER_00]: the web and plug in their messages,
dates when those messages should occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: base temperatures, key risk windows,
length of wetness, that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that model would just essentially
auto-generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to validate it in research
mode, make sure it was working,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then potentially implement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenges and opportunities going
forward, funding, funding, funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that Cooperative Extension and
Land Grant University are losing funding
[SPEAKER_00]: across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why our yearly fees have gone
down, down, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to keep those as low as we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: State climatology mesonets are in the same
boat in terms of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working with them to figure out
how, on our website, we can attribute that
[SPEAKER_00]: data to that specific state mesonet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got two or three really good
ideas going forward that I think may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to figure out how do
we blend with existing systems like MSUs
[SPEAKER_00]: and viral weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the geographic reach of our
models?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we validate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really great to have a model
for leaf wetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf wetness sensors stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the bane of plant pathologists
across the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a really good algorithm for leaf
wetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are scientists across the US and
in Canada that have been working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to obviously utilize the
National Digital Forecast Database and
[SPEAKER_00]: real-time mesoscale analysis data to do a
better job with precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, and leaf wetness in those
virtual locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, data quality control is always
a challenge and very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want that website upgrade and
responsive web design.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York State IPM program is looking
to staff a NUA coordinator full time if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the money to underwrite that
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would love to have a programmer
also in the New York State IPM program to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us build these various tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, NUA is access to IPM
decision support, providing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable management of pests using
methods that minimize environmental health
[SPEAKER_00]: and economic risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use plant disease epidemiology,
insect phenology, plant phenology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and crop management to generate these
phenology models and forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 40-plus tools on our wish list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want more station locations,
better end user cache and alarms,
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality control and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that developer sandbox would be pretty
cool, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing a really good job in fruits,
particularly trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tree fruit and grape in New York
and across the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a pretty good job in
vegetables for onions and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some sweet corn products,
cabbage maggot product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just put a grant in to look at
insect phenology models in Christmas trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that could spill over and help the nursery
trade in New York and across the area that
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA reaches into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could do a lot better job in field
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And livestock, could we do anything with
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Rutz, professor of veterinary
entomology when he was director of the IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: program said, absolutely, Julie,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I expect that you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NUA, again, is open access,
real-time, query-based decision support
[SPEAKER_00]: with built-in biofixes and an interactive,
user-friendly interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for your attention
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And open it up for any questions you might
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
