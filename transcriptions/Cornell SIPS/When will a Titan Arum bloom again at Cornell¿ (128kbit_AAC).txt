[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting to the end of the Titan
exhibit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sibling corm to We Stinky that we've
had on display all week is going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: planted today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, I just found a label at the
bottom of this pot that guarantees that
[SPEAKER_01]: this pot will not break for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to call the manufacturer and find
out if there's a warranty against Titans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if that nullifies the warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our sibling corm to We Stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one doesn't have a name yet,
because if you didn't know already,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tradition with Titan growers,
we don't actually give it a pet name until
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're very hopeful this is going to
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been telling people that this little
bud in the middle that's starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: swell, we're fairly certain is a flower
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all goes well, with a bit of luck,
we could have a Titan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another Titan blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess now is four to six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll have to check back on the blog,
because it's hard to say at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it weighs about 55 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try not to get a workers
comp claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is just about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our Day New Mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, we do name these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give these pet names when they bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if you have any good names,
write them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might do a vote, which is what we did
when we named We Stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titans tend not to be dormant for very
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they stay wet, it probably will be
even less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flower that makes babies cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we have watered in our sibling
plant to We Stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're just going to have to water
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably everybody wants to know,
when can I say for sure if this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really won't know until the bud
emerges from the soil, which I expect to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a couple months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about a month after that, once it's
about 30 inches tall, we'll start to
[SPEAKER_01]: notice a bulge in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really hoping for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a reasonable expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in two to three months,
check the blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll let you know where things are
at.

Thank you.
