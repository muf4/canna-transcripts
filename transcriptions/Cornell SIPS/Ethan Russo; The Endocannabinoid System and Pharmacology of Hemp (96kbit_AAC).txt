[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Tony Barocco, and I currently
assist Zachary Stancil, who is our hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: curator at the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we help run this hemp germplasm
repository, which you can think of as a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our goal is to collect a diverse
genetic hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our second goal is to make this
diverse population of hemp available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we all of this information that we
gather will be available on GrinGlobal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be a tool that researchers
and educators can use to replicate
[SPEAKER_01]: findings and have better reliable
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today, I would like to introduce
our speaker, Ethan Russo, he's a board
[SPEAKER_01]: certified neurologist, psychopharmacology
researcher and author.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the founder and CEO of CREDO
Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, he was the director of
research and development of the
[SPEAKER_01]: International Cannabis and Cannabinoids
Institute based in Prague, Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a medical director of Phytex,
a biotechnology company researching and
[SPEAKER_01]: developing innovative approaches to
targeting the human endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from 2013, to 2014, he served as
senior medical advisor, medical monitor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and study physician to GW Pharmaceuticals
in the United Kingdom for numerous phase
[SPEAKER_01]: one to three clinical trials of Cetivex
for alleviation of cancer pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: unresponsive to optimize opioid treatment,
and initial studies of Epidolex for
[SPEAKER_01]: intractable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, I'll give Ethan
the room and take us away, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention that my late father was
an alumnus of Cornell starting back,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in 1938.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so it's a pleasure to be with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a difficult task today to sort
of summarize the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: and the pharmacology of hemp, but I tried
to make this complimentary to other
[SPEAKER_02]: lectures in the series.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email is listed here and I'd be happy
to hear from you with questions
[SPEAKER_02]: subsequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with a lot of different companies
in one capacity or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these have not been remunerative
and they would have no bearing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: particular content today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The material that I'm gonna discuss is
mostly not approved by the US Food and
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug Administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people were to use any of these
materials, the results might vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking, of course, about
cannabis sativa, cultivated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we came to learn of the thing
called the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this makes cannabinoids in glandular
trichomes on unfertilized female flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: tops that give us tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was through research of this
molecule that it was discovered that there
[SPEAKER_02]: were endogenous cannabinoids, particularly
anandamide and two-arachidonal glycerol
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually lodge on cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are called endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endocannabinoid system is an internal
homeostatic regulatory system in
[SPEAKER_02]: chordates, and there are three components.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endogenous cannabinoids as mentioned,
the CB1, CB2, and what's called the TRPV1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, probably other receptors such as
serotonin 1A receptor, also includes the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the nervous system, the
endocannabinoids are produced on demand
[SPEAKER_02]: and travel in a retrograde fashion to the
CB1 receptor where they then inhibit the
[SPEAKER_02]: release of neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this instance, glutamate is a
stimulatory nerve neurotransmitter,
[SPEAKER_02]: so if this is inhibited, there's a net
loss of function.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, however, there is GABA here,
which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[SPEAKER_02]: the net effect is a stimulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the endocannabinoid system,
there are probably 98 other molecules that
[SPEAKER_02]: resemble anandamide and 2AG.
[SPEAKER_02]: These active and inactive components work
together in what's been called an
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CB1 expression in the brain is
extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually are more CB1 receptors than
there are for all the neurotransmitters
[SPEAKER_02]: combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: CB1 is highly expressed in areas of the
brain that pertain to pain responses,
[SPEAKER_02]: balance, emotion, and reward pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although it also is in the brainstem,
there are barely any cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: in the medullary areas that subserve
respiratory drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is no dose of THC or related
cannabinoids that can cause apnea or
[SPEAKER_02]: stopping breathing like the opiates do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endocannabinoid system is also
throughout the other areas of the nervous
[SPEAKER_02]: system, including the spinal cord,
the periphery, and the gut, the enteric
[SPEAKER_02]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The role of the endocannabinoid system has
been summarized as relaxed, eat,
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep, forget, and protect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could provide about 30 other
adjectives that would also apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is the thing that modulates
pain, memory, movement, emotion,
[SPEAKER_02]: appetite, whether someone will vomit or
not, have a seizure or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: gastrointestinal movement and secretion,
and just about any other function.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are mainly peripheral.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a non-psychoactive receptor that
modulates immune responses and
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has an anti-fibrotic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are many conditions where
stimulation of this system can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CB2 has been typified as a protective
system for all these different organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd single out the liver where
stimulation of this would seem to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: role in preventing cirrhosis and other
problems in the liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also in the skin, both CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: The familiar cannabidiol, in addition to
being anti-inflammatory and
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteriostatic, it works on another
receptor called TRPV4 and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibits the release of CB2 which is the
oily stuff on the skin that is the place
[SPEAKER_02]: where the bacteria that produce acne feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, throughout the body,
although this looks like a heartless and
[SPEAKER_02]: spineless individual, all those functions
are also subserved and modulated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, cannabidiol was recently shown to
stimulate bone fracture healing and may
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be indicated for athletes in the
future if the laws change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's turn to the plant, which I think
is gonna be of more interest to this
[SPEAKER_02]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, cultivated cannabis,
probably the most useful single plant on
[SPEAKER_02]: earth in that it provides food from the
seed, fuel from the seed oil, fiber from
[SPEAKER_02]: the stocks and pharmacy, mainly from the
infertilized female flowering tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a dioecious annual that's been
assigned to the Cannabaceae family along
[SPEAKER_02]: with hops and a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a chemical typology of cannabis
that was developed by Ernest Small going
[SPEAKER_02]: back clear into the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type 1 is the more familiar high THC,
chemovirus chemical varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no strains in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strains are for bacteria and viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type 2 is mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally with THC and CBD of equal
proportions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type 3 of the CBD predominant chemovars
that have come into the fore particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: since the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from an article a few years back
and it shows the different parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and the heterogeneous production of
chemicals in the different parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the greatest concentration of
cannabinoids and monoterpenoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: sesquiterpenoids is in the glandular
trichomes of the infertilized female
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're totally different chemicals in
the roots, triterpenoids and alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the seeds we have essential fatty
acids, high quality of dust and protein on
[SPEAKER_02]: their various anti-inflammatory compounds
throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the distribution of THC and
other cannabinoids, this again is greatest
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ganja or sinsemia, unfertilized
female flowering tops, much greater than
[SPEAKER_02]: those that are fertilized and very much
higher than the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's almost none elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close up of the capitate glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are of the highest volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are found on the bracts around the
unfertilized female flowers as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: sessile trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Found on the leaves of a much smaller
volume, also qualitatively different.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tend to be higher in bitter
sesquiterpenoids that discourage grazing
[SPEAKER_02]: such as by deer and other ungulates.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the 12 best typified
phytocannabinoids, cannabinoids from
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the familiar THC and cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also got the cannabinoid acids
that are the precursors in the fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these has unique pharmacology and
we'll get into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the biosynthetic pathway of the
cannabinoids, generally starting with
[SPEAKER_02]: these two precursors, olivatolic acid with
a five carbon pentyl side chain and
[SPEAKER_02]: geranyl pyrophosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these start out being the parent
compounds for cannabigerolic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And subsequently that goes down to
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, THCA and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of these under heat or light will get
decarboxylated to the neutral
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, geranyl pyrophosphate can also react
with diverinic acid, which has got a
[SPEAKER_02]: propyl side chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this produces the propyl cannabinoids
that we see on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, geranyl pyrophosphate is
also the parent compound to the
[SPEAKER_02]: monoterpenoids and the sesquiterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the terpenoids and the cannabinoids are
both produced in glandular trichomes and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're half siblings based on a common
parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does the plant make these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can tell you was not put on God's
green earth to get people high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans are perhaps several hundred
thousand years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is 30 million years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the endocannabinoid system has been
present in the animals for 600 million
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just get an idea of the ontogeny of
this all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But THC is production is greatest in
bright light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be there to reduce ultraviolet
light damage to the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG and CBD are both anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes form a mechanical insect
trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the acid cannabinoids are
actually insecticidal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also produce necrosis in plant cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bushy plant at the beginning will prune
itself towards the end to look more like
[SPEAKER_02]: this, very lanky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is its final efforts at gaining
fertilization, which we humans prevent to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the amount of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking about THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this obviously is the major
psychoactive component of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: not isolated and identified until 1964 by
Professor Meshulam in Israel, a student
[SPEAKER_02]: still active at age 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a weak partial agonist at both the
CB1 and CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pain-killing, analgesic,
prevents itching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also bronchodilatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 19th century, cannabis cigarettes
were used to treat asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 20 times the anti-inflammatory
power of aspirin and twice that of
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrocortisone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So muscle relaxant, that's the basis for
the approval of Sativex in 30 countries to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat spasticity, muscle tightness
associated with multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well known as an antiemetic,
helping prevent nausea and vomiting in
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is neither a COX-1 or COX-2
inhibitor like the non-steroidals.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very interesting property is it seems to
build up a beta amyloid in Alzheimer
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabidiol is not intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is psychoactive, however.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its pharmacology is actually broader,
although this is much less potent molecule
[SPEAKER_02]: per molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was isolated in 1940, but only
identified positively in 1963.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not bind directly to the CB1
receptors, but rather is what's called a
[SPEAKER_02]: negative allosteric modulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It binds to another receptor in a form
that affects the binding in a way that
[SPEAKER_02]: reduces the psychoactive effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stronger than vitamin C or vitamin E
in this regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like capsaicin, it is an agonist at the
TribV1 receptor with about equal potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may desensitize the receptor,
which is helpful in pain responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also increases the gain of the
endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake of anandamide and inhibiting its
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contrary to popular belief, this is a
stimulatory compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the basis for its FDA approval as
Epidiolex in treating Gervais and
[SPEAKER_02]: Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In high doses, it is an anti-anxiety
agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabidiol, like the other cannabinoids,
has a cytotoxic effect against multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer cells, while at the same time being
preservative for normal cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is quite different to conventional
pharmacology agents used in chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: that tend to be generally toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also acts on a thing called tumor
necrosis factor alpha, which is important
[SPEAKER_02]: in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel diseases, and other autoimmune
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not a COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our group identified this as an agonist at
the serotonin 1A receptor, and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: basis for its effect on anxiety,
also to reduce damage due to strokes and
[SPEAKER_02]: problems in thinking related to liver
failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also works on the adenosine receptor
A2A.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have a role in preventing slow
virus infection and, as mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: previously, stimulates bone fracture
healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are a lot of misconceptions
about cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of companies sell products where
there's a tiny amount, five milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: here, 10 milligrams there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, when cannabidiol is used as an
isolate, very high doses are needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the desirable effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's commonly reported to be a
sedative, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early chemovars available in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabidiol in them tended to be very
high in mercine, sedating terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: This produced the misconception that it's
sedative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will hear that this is legal in all 50
states, but this is still a matter of
[SPEAKER_02]: debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, certain commerce in cannabidiol was
allowed under the agriculture farm bill in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018, but it remains a schedule one
product outside of its use as epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the FDA, it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a misconception that it turns
to THC in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, a group in Brazil had a very
interesting trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used hundreds of milligrams of pure
cannabidiol in a great number of patients
[SPEAKER_02]: and recovered no THC as a metabolite.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a schematic of the natural history
of CBD from a hemp field in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_02]: showing the glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, the biosynthetic pathway to
cannabidiolic acid, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated by heat, light,
or aging to produce cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the pure crystals look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, in normal hepatic metabolism,
we get seven-hydroxycannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're going to turn to some
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: As mentioned, CBD as epidiolex has been
approved to treat a couple of rare but
[SPEAKER_02]: important seizure syndromes called
Gervain-Lennox-Gastaut syndromes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at very high doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCs can be pro-convulsant, produce
seizures, and rodents at extreme doses,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is not substantiated in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other anticonvulsants in
cannabis, including
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabivarin, linalool,
which is a terpenoid, and likely
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabinoic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, although in full-spectrum
products, reportedly, there have been
[SPEAKER_02]: results in treating seizures that are as
good as CBD at about 5% of times the dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, epidiolex went through
randomized controlled trials, whereas
[SPEAKER_02]: these other preparations, these are
observations that were not controlled with
[SPEAKER_02]: placebos.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD has also been used in treating
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC as cannabis is widely used by
psychotic patients, perhaps trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: cover some symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that early use in the susceptible
patient may precipitate earlier expression
[SPEAKER_02]: of schizophrenia, but only in those with a
seeming predisposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, there's no evidence that
you make someone schizophrenic if they did
[SPEAKER_02]: not have a predisposition before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been two phase two randomized
controlled trials of CBD at high doses in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 800 to 1,000 milligram day range,
both effective on positive and negative
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms of schizophrenia, equivalent to
the results with atypical antipsychotics,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with fewer side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that definitely should
be pursued.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biosynthetic pathway here is that for
cannabigerol, which is the next one I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to discuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's particularly pertinent because
there are now chemovars of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: available that are predominantly or solely
cannabigerol with no THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these can qualify as hemp,
quote unquote, under the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much as before, we've got olivatolic
acid, geranyl pyrophosphate to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabigerolic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under heat or light, there's
decarboxylation to cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of a
cannabigerol-only chemovar from GW
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The science of CBG has been less
investigated, but is very compelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is first isolated in 1964 from
Lebanese Hashish, again, by Professor
[SPEAKER_02]: Mashulam.
[SPEAKER_02]: They called this the missing link in the
plant synthesis cannabinoid constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the precursor to the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initial studies really didn't show much in
the animal studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was synthesized in 1971.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was shown to be a GABA uptake
inhibitor that could explain some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: roles as a muscle relaxant and an
anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has antifungal properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has analgesic painkilling properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like THC, it may lower pressure in the eye
on glaucoma, although these are greasy
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules and nobody's figured out how to
apply it directly, effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were painkilling properties that
were noted in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like CBD, this is cytotoxic for a variety
of cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2005, a CBG-only plant was developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't have the enzymes or
pneumatic equipment to go beyond CBGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been effective in various cancer
cell lines and breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It showed antidepressant effects in
animals, lowers blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may reduce the production of
keratinocytes and psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has only a weak partial agonist
activity at the cannabinoid receptors,
[SPEAKER_02]: a tenth of that of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in high doses, doesn't seem to be
intoxicating the way THC is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating study from 2008 showed
powerful antibiotic activity against gram
[SPEAKER_02]: positives, especially in
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
[SPEAKER_02]: aureus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also stimulates several TRIP channels,
especially TRIP and MATE, which suggests
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit in bladder cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like CBD, it also inhibits anandamide
uptake and may increase the gain of the
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also affects PPAR-gamma, a nuclear
receptor, and down-regulated tumor
[SPEAKER_02]: necrosis factor alpha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a recent study that showed
that it worked on glioblastoma multiforme,
[SPEAKER_02]: the worst form of brain disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was found in the brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, this molecule, both
cannabigerolic acid and cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been found in a South African daisy
called Helichrysum umbraculi gerum,
[SPEAKER_02]: but only in trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, our group studied cannabigerol,
the first human subject study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put this through an institutional
review board, worked online and required
[SPEAKER_02]: that people be adults and that they had
used the CBG predominant product,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least 50% CBG in the past six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just shows the demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 127 completers of the survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predominantly female, women are better at
following directions on surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unlike most studies of patient groups
using cannabis, the majority were working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless these people were high
functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average duration of use was nine
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people had an average of about three
and a half grams of CBG flour a week or a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram of concentrate a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's lower than what we usually
attribute to THC predominant chemiverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: A variety of conditions that you see
listed on the left were treated by these
[SPEAKER_02]: patients with cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over half used it medically with only a
small percentage that they feel it was
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a mix for 36.2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most common conditions cited were
anxiety, chronic pain, depression and
[SPEAKER_02]: insomnia, which are quite similar to the
demographics that we see for other forms
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis used therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the efficacy of the CBG
treatment, the majority of conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: reportedly were much or very much
improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the numbers were small on each,
two thirds of the people who used the for
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis found it beneficial and
three quarters of those with inflammatory
[SPEAKER_02]: bowel disease and for a greater number for
irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, in no instance did people
think the conventional medicine that they
[SPEAKER_02]: had taken previously was superior to CBG
for any of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always concerned about whether the
withdrawal effects, but a number of people
[SPEAKER_02]: actually were able to discontinue
antidepressants, non-opioid painkillers
[SPEAKER_02]: and protein pump inhibitors after taking
CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of side effects, 44% reported
none.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there were side effects, the most
common were dry mouth, sleepiness,
[SPEAKER_02]: increased appetite, dry eyes, which all
really are likely related to some amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of THC in those preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with CBG preparations,
we don't see these complaints.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% reported side benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of withdrawal from the medicine
itself, 84.3% reported side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% reported no withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And compared to non-CBG cannabis,
the more typical THC type cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were many fewer issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So conclusions of the survey study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that usage of this is increasing,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_02]: where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the first study of potential
therapeutic effects in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anxiety, pain, depression, insomnia were
the most commonly reported target
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perceived efficacy was quite high with
few adverse events.
[SPEAKER_02]: The efficacy that was reported in
inflammatory bowel diseases also goes
[SPEAKER_02]: along with reports of CBG being beneficial
in animal models.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that the survey supports the
idea that CBG would be safe for future
[SPEAKER_02]: randomized controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does CBG compare to CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, both can treat pain, anxiety,
and made sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both affect the TRP channels, have
antibiotic properties, and are cytotoxic
[SPEAKER_02]: for cancers, and may increase
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, cannabigerol is a lot more potent
than CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, that means fewer milligrams are
necessary to be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, anti-anxiety effects of CBD
may require 100 to 400 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas 10 to 20 milligrams of CBG seem to
be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, CBG-only chemo varts are available
in some jurisdictions, whereas it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to eliminate THC completely from type
3 CBD chemo varts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to THC, cannabigerol likely would
be a useful adjunct to many THC chemo
[SPEAKER_02]: varts by providing synergistic benefits on
pain, sleep, and mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because CBG has a strong anti-anxiety
effect, it may increase the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: index of THC, giving you more leeway in
dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do we expect from this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the things the world needs
now is a safe, non-sedating, non-addictive
[SPEAKER_02]: agent to treat anxiety, and CBG may be the
best candidate I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be quite safe and versatile,
so its addition to various cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_02]: preparations makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be an impressive agent for
primary cancer treatment, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it kills cancer cells,
but it doesn't kill normal cells and is
[SPEAKER_02]: not intoxicating like THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could be an antibiotic of the
future, especially for MRSA, and another
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant bug, vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus VRE.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another agent in cannabis, hard to come
by, is cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is produced by a recessive gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, there are only trace amounts,
if any, in most types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also antibiotic and antifungal,
cytotoxic, an extract-produced
[SPEAKER_02]: antidepressant effects in rodents,
again, working on various trip channels
[SPEAKER_02]: and inhibiting the breakdown of
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, selective breeding may make
this more available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, turning to the cannabinoid acids,
cannabidiolic acid is what the plant makes
[SPEAKER_02]: before CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the predominant in
phyto-cannabinoid and fresh hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a natural herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one can produce coxin-abition,
but only at extreme doses, which should
[SPEAKER_02]: never be necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a powerful agent as an antiemetic,
preventing vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mediated through the serotonin
receptor, and it's about between 100 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000 times more effective than CBD
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on historical data, of how hemp was
used by the Renaissance herbalists,
[SPEAKER_02]: it may be useful in treating tumors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we skipped something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In relation to the entourage effect,
we mentioned this before with the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage of endocannabinoids,
but the same may apply to
[SPEAKER_02]: phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote from 1999, this type of synergism
may play a role in the widely held but not
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentally based view that in some
cases plants are better drugs than the
[SPEAKER_02]: natural products isolated from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we have a lot of ammunition to
support the idea of synergy of the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this clinically in combinations
of full spectrum products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, cannabis doesn't just make
cannabinoids, it also makes the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenoids, which may be painkillers,
anti-inflammatory, have mood modulating
[SPEAKER_02]: effects and reduce the side effects of
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see here some of the main terpenoids
found in cannabis, also other plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are common to produce the same ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going through these very quickly,
the most prevalent terpene in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-merged morphine, also found in celery
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call this the primary couchlock factor
in cannabis because it is extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: sedating when combined with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sedation is a narcotic-like
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a painkiller, but it can be
antagonized by naloxone, the thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: they give as an antidote to opioid
overdoses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's working through a different
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: There tends to be a great deal of this in
most kinds of cannabis, and we usually
[SPEAKER_02]: want to see less so that the results are
less sedating for the chronic pain
[SPEAKER_02]: patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, but less seen in cannabis
these days is alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most common terpene in nature
from pine needles and other conifers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bioavailable via inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a bronchodilator like THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has wide-spectrum antibiotic activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its greatest effect, though, is as an
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acetylcholine is the memory molecule,
neurotransmitter in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because alpha-pinene reduces its
breakdown, its presence in cannabis may
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce or eliminate short-term memory
impairment by THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also may have a neuroprotective effect,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this is supported by the fact that
walking in a pine forest, or what the
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese call shinrin-yoku, or forest
bathing, is very good for clearing the
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another agent we'd like to see more of in
cannabis is D-limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: This scent is gonna be familiar to anyone
who's been near citrus, whether it be
[SPEAKER_02]: lemons, limes, or anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: In humans, this has had a potent
antidepressant and immune-stimulating
[SPEAKER_02]: effect that was shown in hospitalized
depressed patients in Japan, lowering
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamilton depression scores and allowing
discontinuation of standard
[SPEAKER_02]: antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also may be useful as a dietary aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It increases mitochondria biogenesis and
may turn white fat, the storage fat,
[SPEAKER_02]: of obesity into brown fat, which is more
metabolically active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Linolule is a turpenoid, common to
lavender, well-known as an anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_02]: agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, again, has been shown in humans,
particularly demented patients with
[SPEAKER_02]: Alzheimer disease that get ornery at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also prominent local anesthetic effects
and anticonvulsant effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this has been demonstrated
clinically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caryophylline is a very interesting
compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sesquiterpenoid, 15 carbons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has strong anti-inflammatory
properties, comparable to phenylbutazone
[SPEAKER_02]: that's used as a non-steroidal in horses,
but not people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unlike the non-steroidal drugs,
it protects the stomach from ulcers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually is also a cannabinoid,
it's a selective CB2 agonist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not intoxicating like THC,
but can produce those anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits without producing psychoactive
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what's called a phytofax
demonstration of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: turpenoids in this particular chemovar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most prevalent cannabinoids this is
CBD and CBG, very lower, much lower
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: What patients report in terms of the aroma
and flavor if inhaled, and the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: that they report.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's high in comfort and calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see the predominant turpenoids here
is limonene and cariophylline with very
[SPEAKER_02]: low mercy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a type three because it's
predominantly CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a non-sedating agent,
very low in THC and mercy, but high in
[SPEAKER_02]: cariophylline, limonene, and cumulene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients report comfort, and likely this
would be helpful in treating pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation, and both CBD and
cariophylline can be helpful in treating
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also may be good for angina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how we analyze what's in
cannabis to see what it might be good for
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would refer you to ethanmarizzo.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a library of all my publications
and PDF form, which you can download there
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's my personal website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be breaking any copyright
laws is my understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll thank you for your attention and
hope that I've left plenty of time for
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a absolutely gripping and
fascinating talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can speak for everyone that we
fully enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to just give a quick thanks to
our interpreters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as well as Tony, George,
Gemma, and Kim as well for making this
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're so proud at the USDA Plant
Genetics Resources Unit to host this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowledge and information sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we just want to thank you,
Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe Tony and George have some
questions from the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of questions, so we'll try to
get through as many as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: As many as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: First question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there phenotypes of cannabis described
by small published in 1975 still relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: for modern varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any research planned or currently
working on reevaluating the 0.3% threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: on THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: The 0.3% threshold is a political act and
has nothing to do with science.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would mean, team, to you is the
concentration is much less important than
[SPEAKER_02]: the total dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that we had material that was
0.25% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you take too much of it,
you could become intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the same token, you could have 5% THC
material, but if only a small amount is
[SPEAKER_02]: taken, it would not necessarily be
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be fair, this was an effort to allow
commerce in material that the government
[SPEAKER_02]: hoped would not create other problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's happened is people have taken
the abundant biomass of CBD predominant
[SPEAKER_02]: material and transmogrified it into Delta
8 THC and other items, which clearly are
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we obviously need to do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my suggestion would be that the
politicians speak more to scientists that
[SPEAKER_02]: are experienced in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do other plant groups produce
cannabinoids at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got an article that's on the
website ethemrisa.org called Beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Plants in the Endocannabinoid
System in terms of things that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a component of kava kava,
pipermethisticum, called yangonin that
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to be an agonist at CB1.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the New Zealand liverwort,
Radula marginata, that has THC-like
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem there is this is a rare
plant, and it grows a millimeter or two a
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the prospect that this is ever going to
be an agricultural crop is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are lots of other examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things that work on various
receptors of the broad endocannabinoidome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even prebiotics and probiotics affect
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that article would point to other
plants, foods, and crops that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: leveraged to benefit the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question in from Ernie Siebert from
Alabama A&M asks, is the American Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: Association and the NIH on board with
full-scale clinical trials, research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and prescribing cannabinoids to patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid he's asking the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for 26 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to do clinical trials of cannabis
and migraine back in the 90s and really
[SPEAKER_02]: got stonewalled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FDA cleared it, but the National
Institute on Drug Abuse had then and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much still has a monopoly on the
supply and would not provide the material
[SPEAKER_02]: for those clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the situation has improved,
it's testament to the fact that it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to do this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent most of the last 26 years
working for foreign companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a lot of room for
improvement in the capability to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of research, which should not be
ceded to other countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you elaborate a little further on
why cannabis is not referred to as a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I investigated this in the article by
Lewis et al, on which I was co-author.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go into some detail on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strains is a useful term for viruses and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: A better term for cannabis would be
chemical varieties, chemovars,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also should be used instead of the
terminology sativa and indica,
[SPEAKER_02]: which have nothing to do with the
taxonomic descriptions of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 18th century, by Linnaeus and Lamarck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's called indica today doesn't look
at all like what Lamarck described.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had precedence.
[SPEAKER_02]: As best we can ascertain, there's one very
promiscuous species of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can interbreed any type of cannabis
with another.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what differentiates them is their
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is mediated by their chemical
contents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I prefer the term chemovar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler Gordon asks, can CBG be manufactured
in a lab or is it easier to extract from
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it can be made biosynthetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are various groups working with
yeast and E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli to biosynthetically produce
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this hasn't been scaled up to be
practical yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's relatively easy to grow if you know
how.
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, I think I'm no Luddite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the science of the biosynthetic
approaches is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, to me, it will never equal what
the plant can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant that from its flowering
tops can produce upwards of 30%
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, which is phenomenal for any
secondary metabolite of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure of a parallel to equal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, it doesn't produce one thing
generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It produces this entourage of compounds
that are synergistic to one another and no
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterium or yeast is gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a strong proponent of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also add the genome of the cannabis
plant is so plastic that you can make it
[SPEAKER_02]: do anything you want through good
selective breeding with conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of genetic modification and
particularly for cannabis, this should
[SPEAKER_02]: never be necessary because you can make it
do almost anything you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question from Dr. Sarah Eichler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is research on potential agricultural pest
control applications using various
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids available?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the CredoScience website, you'll see
that one of our projects relates to
[SPEAKER_02]: development of cannabis-based treatment
for head lice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously through the question,
it was understood that their insecticidal
[SPEAKER_02]: properties of the acid cannabinoids in
particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, this could be leveraged to produce
agricultural products that would be safer
[SPEAKER_02]: as not just insecticides, but possibly as
herbicides as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really interested in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, this hasn't taken off in the
industry probably because of remaining
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: With legalization, I think this would be
an avenue of greater interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly are interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else, are any of the compounds
full agonists at CB1 or CB2?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, fortunately, and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even THC alone is really too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is a synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been available as an FDA-approved
drug called Marinol since 1985.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's had very poor uptake and the
reason is most people can't tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to produce dysphoria,
unhappiness rather than euphoria,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even experienced cannabis users don't
tend to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do see full agonists among the
synthetic cannabinoids, K2, spice,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the lice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is a by-product of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, those aren't identified
on urine drug screens and so people turn
[SPEAKER_02]: to them, but those are overtly dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endocannabinoid system is a very
subtle system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs gentle nudges, not huge pushes
pharmacologically as would be provided by
[SPEAKER_02]: pure THC or full agonists at the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be a natural full agonist in the
form of THCP, tetrahydrocannabinforol,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like THC but with a seven carbon
side chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this has only been found so far
trace amounts and that's just as well
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's 23 times more potent than THC
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I think is directed towards
your CBG study.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking what were the doses used
with the many promising results and at
[SPEAKER_01]: those doses, what were the negative side
effects found and how complete are the
[SPEAKER_01]: risk assessment?
[SPEAKER_02]: The exact dosing again would depend on how
often the person used it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't stratify the data that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we know from speaking to people
and observations that 10 to 20 milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: at a time seems to be quite effective for
most people for most things, particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: in treating anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know of people inhaling 40 milligrams of
pure CBG at once with no adverse events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what the upper limit is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably is very high because it's just
not intoxicating and there's no withdrawal
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a person is getting the desired effect
at a lower dose, that's what we recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point in wasting material even
if it doesn't have obvious side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question asked, do you know of any
early production of sincemilia cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to the 1970s?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem that it would have happened
earlier given human plant understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a place called the India where
ganja has been grown for thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a technique that was known to
the ancients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asks, Dr. Russo, would you say
that the misconception of sedation can be
[SPEAKER_01]: related to the actual receptor behaviors
while connecting and interworking within
[SPEAKER_01]: the anatomy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this relation of CBD Yeah,
in this instance, again, at extreme doses
[SPEAKER_02]: like 1500 milligrams a day, CBD has been
observed to produce sedation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is in the context of patients on
polypharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, these are patients with severe
epilepsy that are on scads of drugs at
[SPEAKER_02]: once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are drug-drug interactions,
additive sedation, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at low and moderate doses,
CBD is stimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends in California that use a
dose of CBD in the morning instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: caffeine these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been tested by
electroencephalography and sleep studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question comes from Phoenix
saying, thank you for your contributions
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the status of the current research
on CHS, which I believe he means
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid hyperemus syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are two articles on our
website, EthanRusso.org, the library,
[SPEAKER_02]: and beyond the first page.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a survey that's the largest
database to date on cannabinoid hyperemus
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those not familiar, there is a small
subset of people who use cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: chronically in high amounts that develop a
syndrome of abdominal pain, nausea,
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiting, and with a strange behavior of
hot water bathing, sometimes hours a day
[SPEAKER_02]: to allay symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This affects certain people and not
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hypothesized that there was a genetic
cause, and that turned out to be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We identified five statistically
significant mutations in CHS patients as
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to control patients who use
cannabis at high rates but did not have
[SPEAKER_02]: the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a commercial test that's
available, and that's accessible at
[SPEAKER_02]: what-is-CHS.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the paper is there for you to
download.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody is asking, does CBD work better
with a small amount of THC included?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm fond of saying that there's
nothing that CBD does that can't be
[SPEAKER_02]: enhanced by a tiny amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is the way it comes in nature
invariably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidiolex probably is 97% pure because the
FDA was THC-phobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't like the idea of giving THC to
kids, even though the benefits would far
[SPEAKER_02]: outweigh the risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These children with Lennox-Gastaut and
Dravet syndrome are severely cognitively
[SPEAKER_02]: impaired in general and have sometimes
hundreds of seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any negative effect of THC really pales
in comparison to the benefits it might
[SPEAKER_02]: have therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another question related to the
cannabis cannabinoids and insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically asking, are there
any terpenes like alpha-pinene or limonene
[SPEAKER_01]: used as insecticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, basically, the cannabis
flower is really designed to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: insects at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are insecticidal properties from
the cannabinoids, the terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also, if an insect touches the
trichome, it'll tend to burst and then
[SPEAKER_02]: polymerize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a mechanical insect trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really elegant system to try and
control predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have time for maybe one last
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have fungi or mycotoxins been looked at
as a trigger or a factor for hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that ain't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The symptoms don't match.
[SPEAKER_02]: The toxicology of those substances doesn't
match CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've identified the genetic cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, people are always looking
for other explanations and find it hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that THC is the culprit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this instance, it's too much of what
can be a good thing is a bad thing for
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really bombarded Dr. Russo with a
lot of great questions today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to thank you again so much
for your vast knowledge and insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone else has as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you once again on behalf of the
USDA Plant Genetics Resources Unit and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell University at Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a real pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
