[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Solveig Hansen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk with you all today
about participatory plant breeding and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a chance to be a part of the Cornell
plant science community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to talk to you about
participatory plant breeding and variety
[SPEAKER_00]: trialing, which are themes that have
connected my doctoral and postdoctoral
[SPEAKER_00]: work in vegetable breeding and that I now
get to explore in my current role with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover Crop Breeding Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by way of introduction, my path to
plant breeding started on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in southwest Wisconsin,
where my Norwegian and German ancestors
[SPEAKER_00]: settled in the mid to late 1800s on
Ho-Chunk land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an outdoor kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college and caught the organic
farming bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I spent eight seasons as co-owner
of a direct market vegetable farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, farming tied together
environmental care, working outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: business and marketing, and caring for my
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it as a way to put ethics into
action and ethics into tangible,
[SPEAKER_00]: even edible form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after selling that farm, after about
eight years, I moved to Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a job at Harris Seeds up in
Rochester, New York as organic product
[SPEAKER_00]: manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a farmer, I had observed the difference
between varieties and knew that the choice
[SPEAKER_00]: of variety made a lot of difference in how
well my farm was going to do that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a product manager, I got to observe
these differences systematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, however, know how these
differences came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then came an organic plant breeding
workshop in 2012, where I heard folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: including professors here at Cornell,
describe population creation, selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to think maybe this is
something I could learn also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made some contacts at University of
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long story short, ended up earning a
doctorate in a beet breeding with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irwin Goldman at University of Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went on to do a postdoc in
participatory vegetable breeding at UBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting my plant breeding stories,
I'm just going to take a beat to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've farmed and done research on the
ancestral traditional lands and coercively
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired lands of many different
indigenous groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land acknowledgments have gotten,
have been aptly critiqued for being
[SPEAKER_00]: perfunctory or performative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think it's appropriate just to
hold the space to acknowledge that seed as
[SPEAKER_00]: a way of literally making space on the
land for the people who eat those crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and the farming systems that grow those
crops to sustain themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seed is used as a tool of control
and colonization, even as it's also used
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tool of sustenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to invite us to hold
that in awareness and to hold an awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: of who and what we're making room for on
the land when we do our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in my plant breeding journey,
I heard Bill Tracy, who's a corn breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: at Wisconsin, talk about plant breeding as
conversation, a multi-species
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, most obviously between
humans and crop plants, but with input
[SPEAKER_00]: from the many other species that compose
an agro ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this conversational motif captured my
imagination and reminded me of my
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences as a farmer, where I'm
learning my land by trial and error,
[SPEAKER_00]: by my asking a question and getting an
answer from my land about what it could do
[SPEAKER_00]: with what I was giving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I learned that participatory plant
breeding was not just a concept,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a field with a literature and
researchers and practitioners,
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that this was something I wanted to
get involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to tell two stories,
a participatory beet breeding story,
[SPEAKER_00]: a participatory variety trialing story,
and then talk about possibilities for ways
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use these techniques to enhance
cover crop networks understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crops we're working with and help advance
varieties toward farmer adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So participatory plant breeding is a crop
development strategy that facilitates
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer involved selection in environments
that diverge from conventional plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developed in the global South.
[SPEAKER_00]: With farmers cultivating marginal land,
but it's been adapted widely for use in
[SPEAKER_00]: the global North specifically for farmers
using organic and low input practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it facilitates direct selection in the
target environment, which is often an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or low input environment instead
of indirect selection in a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, which in certain cases and
for certain traits can lead to a better
[SPEAKER_00]: response to selection for complex traits
like yield, climatic adaptation and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPB allows for marketing to start while
cultivars are being developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also allows for creative space and
relationships to build that can pay
[SPEAKER_00]: dividends both during and after the
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participatory breeding projects take a lot
of different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new review of PPB in the global
North by Michaela Colley and she notes
[SPEAKER_00]: that agronomic crop improvement is only
one reason that people use participatory
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks want to, they may want to preserve
crop genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might want to pursue seed sovereignty
or seed security goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they might want to more closely control
the breeding techniques that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first story is about beets and it's
going to require a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: background on beef flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is coming now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preference for table beef is very
divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing about working on table
beef is that upon learning such,
[SPEAKER_00]: many people would tell me that they love
beets or hated beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been a lot of systematic
study of a holistic beef flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's generally agreed that sweet,
earthy, bitter and harsh attributes are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in beet and each associated with
one or several compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earthy flavor is the one most
associated with preference or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-preference for beet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think beets are dirt candy or
that they just taste like dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthy flavor in beet is conferred by
geosmin, this 12 carbon volatile molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is synthesized by a wide variety of
soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the scent of freshly turned earth
and it can be present in water and a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different foods, but it's
usually recognized as a contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are very sensitive to this molecule
more so than many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a study that's almost as old as I am
connected geosmin, earthy aroma and the
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of quote signature beet flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on these assumptions that
geosmin is present, people think beets are
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy and people either do or don't like
that earthy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab at the University of Wisconsin
decided to investigate the origin and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic control of geosmin in table beet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk for a long time about that,
but we are gonna cut to the chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geosmin is heritable and endogenously
produced by beet instead of being absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: by beet from the soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite the low resolution,
this figure shows two QTL, two large
[SPEAKER_00]: effect QTL associated with geosmin
concentration in table beet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also shown geosmin heritability in
both G by E studies and this recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: selection experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this recurrent selection experiment
had a serendipitous dividend in that it
[SPEAKER_00]: produced these cool beet populations with
both extreme geosmin concentration and
[SPEAKER_00]: segregating color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at these and thought,
this is cool population for participatory
[SPEAKER_00]: selection because it's got unique flavor
and it's got unique color and both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things are engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the participatory beet breeding project
sought to develop some specialty cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly relevant in the organic and
direct market farm sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to gauge geosmin preference in not
non-laboratory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran two models and they each had
three groups of selectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a farm group that would select for
horticultural characteristics and then two
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of hedonic selection participants
or people who told me how much they liked
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat the beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the farm model, all these people were
associated with a single farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: South of Madison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the outreach model,
all of the group that I took a survey of
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, about two dozen farmers and then
both chefs and consumers convened by the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to kitchen collaborative helped with
this hedonic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a program of the UW Hort
department specifically Julie Dawson's
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two cycles of participatory
selection followed this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that it started with 30 halves
of families of either high or low geosmin
[SPEAKER_00]: character that families were eliminated at
each step leaving which I'll say more
[SPEAKER_00]: about in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving five families to intermate and
create seed for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To guide horticultural selection,
farmers rated the importance of various
[SPEAKER_00]: traits on a one through five scale on a
survey or just in a conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Pinkus, the farmer in the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers indicated not unexpectedly that
high germination ability to outcompete
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds and disease resistance were top
priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: For selection, so I made a selection index
that weighted traits by farmer priority
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also added qualitative comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using farmer priorities and my
comments, a third of the families were
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining families I sorted into
groups based on their visual appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my hedonic selection participants
went to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I presented all four groups to the core
group of selectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was chefs in the outreach model
and farm staff in the farm model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They narrowed it down to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I presented the last one to the
consumer group and they picked their
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite thing to be advanced to the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't find any differences in liking
between high and low geosmin groups taken
[SPEAKER_00]: in aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is interesting given that geosmin
and earthy flavor were assumed to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: role in preference or non-preference for
bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find two big disparities in liking
and that was around appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those came when we compared a white
bee group to a pigmented bee group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the order of 25% of people liking
the white group and about 80% liking the
[SPEAKER_00]: pigmented group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after trying them, those differences
evened out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both equally liked, suggesting
that a favorable flavor made up for this
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in appearance liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies of expectation, well,
food with low color is often associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with an expectation of low flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that happened here, this would be a
positive disconfirmation of expectations
[SPEAKER_00]: or getting more than you thought you
would, which people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could explain some of this
phenomenon we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notably, both of these groups were
selected by chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of the groups were selected by chefs
whose job is to create both cuisine and
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations around cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those serendipitous
benefits of having people involved who
[SPEAKER_00]: think differently than you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have selected the white bee
groups necessarily, but they did and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers really liked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two generations or two cycles of
that selection process that I showed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the visual phenotypes were set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew what we were heading for
visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that same process didn't quite work
because there weren't colors to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: virally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turned our participatory work
towards flavor characterization and ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up with some cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the low-giasmin side, we had snow
globe and Evans ville ember.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're low-giasmin, but it turns out that
many commercial cultivars are low-giasmin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not really unique in that
aspect, but they're unique in the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were the result of participatory
selection, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seed companies, especially those that
focus on the story of plant breeding along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the products of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those companies is fruition seeds
up in Naples, really close to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They serve gardeners and small-scale
farmers and Evansville ember, they took on
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of their offering, but in a
different form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wanted to keep segregating and
the farm constituency kept saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want a mild red beet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kept selecting out the other colors,
but clearly they were recessive alleles at
[SPEAKER_00]: the two main color low cyan beet and then
a third one that can disperse this blotchy
[SPEAKER_00]: or dappled or tie dyed appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really unique population at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're letting it segregate because
they think it's novel and it allows them
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell a story about plant breeding,
how populations change from generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really want to embrace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that the cultivar is continuing
to evolve after it left my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the high-giasmin side, we had three
cultivars come out two zone selections,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with a few more like coral and magenta
tones, one selected to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this white beet with pink
petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are unique in their flavor
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are higher giasmin than basically
every other beet out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also unique in appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the zone beets are different in both
their vigor and their pigmentation than
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kyosha beet and the blushing up beet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blushing up bashful is the only pink
petioles white beet that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blushing up bashful is being offered by
fruition seeds and Evansville orbit has
[SPEAKER_00]: been picked up by high mowing organic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is in seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exciting to see them going
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a range of intellectual property
agreements or arrangements can be made in
[SPEAKER_00]: participatory breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best solutions for each situation are
highly context dependent, but the general
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to share with farmers,
both money, material benefits from the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and also recognition for their
work in co-selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our context was that this work was done at
the University of Wisconsin under a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal hatch grant using university
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the university tech transfer office,
WARF, had the first right to say what they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do for an intellectual property
arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They declined to PVP or use a plant
variety protection certificate on these
[SPEAKER_00]: beets, which is not uncommon in the
vegetable world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did reserve the right to license
them, which is a common method that they
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of the farm model,
the farmers were easily identifiable as
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Finkus and Beth Casmar of PV
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they decided they would love to be
recognized for their work, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really care about any proceeds coming out
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the outreach model, the people involved
were really too numerous to recognize this
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially and certainly in terms of
monetary payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the organization that sees them,
the Seed to Kitchen Collaborative,
[SPEAKER_00]: does benefit from the royalties that come
through WARF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those royalties are divided basically
three ways between UW Horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: Department, the graduate school,
and the inventors, which are myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Irwin, and the mayor who did the
pre-breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you do the math, like we
don't get to know how much royalties are
[SPEAKER_00]: that's between WARF and the seed company,
but a fairly nominal percentage of an
[SPEAKER_00]: overall sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% of that divided three ways is going to
be an amount to like get a coffee on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't doing it to get rich,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next participatory plant breeding story
takes place north of the border in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I worked with the Canadian Organic
Vegetable and Fruitment Project for
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a farmer collaborative project
launched in 2018 by the UBC Center for
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainable Food Systems and the Bout to
Family Initiative for Canadian Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Security, which is a nationwide non-profit
that works with several regional
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofits, including Farm Folk City,
our bee civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a mouthful and quite a network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the beet breeding project was driven
by me, a researcher with some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and some questions about beet
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenobi was driven by farmers and farmer
advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bout to Initiative had coalesced
farmers who were interested in seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: both a biological and horticultural
perspective, but also an economic,
[SPEAKER_00]: political, and ethical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were very interested in seed
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there are a lot of good seed
companies serving organic growers in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, there is a border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just been reminded recently that
various types of disruptions can interrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And borders do matter for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these folks are interested in building
both the knowledge and the community to
[SPEAKER_00]: either source or grow seed that they can
use north of the border where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: more control over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were particularly interested in
sourcing open pollinated varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially to compete with workhorse
hybrids that they didn't want to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: since they can't count on them being on
the market from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very interested in adaptation,
regionally, which obviously varies widely
[SPEAKER_00]: across a place as big as Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their goal was to identify and develop
vegetable varieties for Canadian organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify, meaning, trialing,
and developing meaning breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program did support a couple of
participatory plant breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: one in sweet pepper, one in carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest locus of grower engagement
was in variety trialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or PVT for participatory variety
trialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is valuable in its own right in that it
just allows people to see varieties on
[SPEAKER_00]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we survey people, that was the number
one biggest benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get to see these things and also
get some community to trade ideas with
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we're seeing in our different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to know more varieties than
you might if you had to purchase all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed yourself empowers people to shift
varieties more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is a seed shortage or when they
just want to diversify their crop
[SPEAKER_00]: offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps them hone their observation
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also heard on surveys that,
you know, I pay attention to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in my farm, but I don't take
notes or like I never I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: discipline myself to go out every week or
every couple of weeks to see how these
[SPEAKER_00]: things were changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this got me to pay attention in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participatory variety trialing also serves
as an entry point for participatory plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in that it can identify market
niches where there isn't anything on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market that's really serving the purpose
in a given region or for a given market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can identify germplasm depending on
what you're trialing and it can build
[SPEAKER_00]: those critical farmer research or
relationships, which is where these good
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas for projects get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety trial participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were participants spread all the
way across Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 60 participants per year,
some of whom, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them tried multiple crops in any
given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were our 2022 trial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get back?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the structure of Kenobi variety trials
were shaped by balancing the nationwide
[SPEAKER_00]: scale of the project with particular
regional interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of this rutabaga trial,
we had a core set of five varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was asked to trial, and then they
could add on these other varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be more relevant to one region or
another, especially Atlantic Canada has a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong attachment to rutabaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: For radicchio trials, we took a different
strategy and grouped the varieties by days
[SPEAKER_00]: to maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And market class so that say growers in
northern Canada could only trial the short
[SPEAKER_00]: day varieties, which are the only ones
that have a chance of finishing during
[SPEAKER_00]: their season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designated the plot size and the
approximate in-row spacing and suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: planting dates for folks, but we asked
them to use their normal maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all organic farmers,
but whatever they would normally do to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a crop so we could get the most
external validity or the most real-world
[SPEAKER_00]: validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the seed-linked trialing platform
for data collection and results
[SPEAKER_00]: visualization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helped with consistency of data
formatting and just ease of data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection compared to Google Sheet
methods and taking a picture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clipboard where I took the notes methods
that had been used previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the years before I was there,
participants used intuitive one through
[SPEAKER_00]: five ratings on various traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got there and found myself
equivocating over the course of a trial
[SPEAKER_00]: session, I thought like, I would really
like a rubric to tell me what each level
[SPEAKER_00]: is supposed to mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we piloted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put out a rubric like this,
specifying what levels of traits means and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're actually trying to measure with
each trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a really good response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our season exit survey, about 80% of
people said that rubric was easy to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it helped them in understanding
difference between trait levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it helped them rate more consistently
among levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most importantly that they
would trust the data more this year
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that everyone had the same
reference to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in response to our request for more
in-season communication that wasn't an
[SPEAKER_00]: email because emails are often overlooked
during the busy season, I started making
[SPEAKER_00]: these trial videos from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would do ratings on my own plots,
I would just give examples that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: one I'm giving a two and here's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really liked this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were conversational.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face was dirty, but it was very,
very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after collecting data from
participants, we presented results in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the benefits to using seed-linked
is that immediately upon the trials being
[SPEAKER_00]: closed, interactive, visualizations are
available for people to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are bar charts for each trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these pie charts that show the
number of people who would or wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a certain variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are also photo galleries and
comment galleries that are fun to look
[SPEAKER_00]: through and really kind of flesh out what
might not be captured in numeric ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also heard from people though that they
wanted a printed report to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: refer back to without having to wade into
a website and play with variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a researcher, I wanted to subject these
things to some kind of statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just did simple ANOVAs, bar charts,
heat maps of means tables, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: little simple explanation of what
statistical significance means.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phrase was, the more bling,
the more real the thing, the more chance
[SPEAKER_00]: it is to be a result of real differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just a couple of examples of results
that we would offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was from our CARA trial this past
year, shows that all traits except
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance showed some region effect and
all of the ratings were higher in Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that my environmental
variable is a very blunt instrument of
[SPEAKER_00]: West or East, because I tried that in
hardiness zone and hardiness zone or
[SPEAKER_00]: grouped hardiness zones didn't show much
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess we did see the same ranking of
varieties in both West and East.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw no cases of G by E, but that of
course doesn't mean that it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that we only had farm locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't integrating environmental
variables and that leaves a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions unanswered and a lot of insights
unseen, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say more about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produced a variety summary for each
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of the better of the
two orange non-scaric varieties that we
[SPEAKER_00]: trialed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taken together, the numerical ratings,
we did some quantitative yield data with a
[SPEAKER_00]: subset of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an idea of what the variety
is, of how much variation you might see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of variation in shape for this
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also quite a bit of variation in flavor
ranging from comments of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing flavor to is the best tasting
carrot in the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it worked, it really worked,
but it was not consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the hybrids were very consistent
as you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we learned several things about
increasing trial completion rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essential for farmers to have input
into and feel enthusiastic about the trial
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and the specific varieties that
they're trialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact throughout the season is really
important because everybody's got a back
[SPEAKER_00]: burn or something and you need to stay in
contact to make sure it's not the trial as
[SPEAKER_00]: often as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data collection needs to be easy because
people are balancing really busy lives and
[SPEAKER_00]: if possible a stipend or some kind of
compensation really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: These farmers were compensated $300
Canadian for a completed trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did interviews, everybody but
one person mentioned unprompted that they
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciated the payment,
but that's an N of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sometimes people participate in
trials like this for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just depends on what the context
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those interviews, I also gleaned a
couple important points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one are that I was asking all these
questions about is this information useful
[SPEAKER_00]: to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one woman said, well, it's really
whether it's usable rather than useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I participated in a radicchio
trial this year doesn't mean I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily in the market for radicchio
seed next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I need it, the information's there,
I can interpret it easily and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just over and over it hit home
that these trials are part of very busy
[SPEAKER_00]: lives and farm businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to come humbly with easy
instructions and just know that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: juggling a lot to be able to give us the
feedback that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in order to maintain the
relationship, we need to reciprocate with
[SPEAKER_00]: useful or usable information in a timely
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't cover the details of the
Kenobi participatory breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just want to highlight a different
option that they used for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The open source seed initiative pledge,
which is modeled after open source
[SPEAKER_00]: software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone familiar with OSI?
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine some folks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's that anyone is permitted
to use the seed, to grow it, to sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, to breed with it, but that any
derivatives from that seed also need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's clearly not appealing to larger
commercial interests, though it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: legally binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the effect has been to create a pool
of open source germplasm that is used by
[SPEAKER_00]: and curated by smaller scale breeders,
on farm breeders who value regional
[SPEAKER_00]: variety adaptation and preservation of
culturally important cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OSI pledge doesn't preclude charging
royalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not, they're not interested in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kitchen table seed house is
offering the renegade red pepper and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were one of the main farmer breeders
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carrots have yet to meet the market,
but hopefully they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're in the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as many of you know, the Cover Crop
Breeding Network since 2015 has been
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding fall sown legume crops,
legume cover crops for traits like fall
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence, winter survival, spring vigor,
high biomass, hard seed, not shattering
[SPEAKER_00]: pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just last year we began breeding
cereal rye specifically for cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The network's first hairy vetch variety
and the first few pea varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: winter pea varieties are moving toward
release this year, which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This map shows sites of university and ARS
breeding and trialing sites in purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: pink, and then a few orange, orange dots
with some on farm breeding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers at those orange pins worked
with Lisa Kusinkusik, who is a Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: grad, who's now at the ARS in Wisconsin,
on a winter pea participatory breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project from 2016 to 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the six pea varieties that are
consistently beating checks in our
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced line trials, four were actually
farmer selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the method briefly was that each farmer
received five F4 pea crosses from the ARS
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder that we're collaborating with in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the plan, they were going to
be their breeding priorities for peas on
[SPEAKER_00]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plan was to plant them out,
care for them according to the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: normal practices, and then use a flagging
system to select plants for various traits
[SPEAKER_00]: in each quadrant of the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then select the best 10% of the plots
for recombining and another selection the
[SPEAKER_00]: following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather had different plans,
a more parsimonious solution to just
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze everything except for about 10% of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a much simpler selection
process, but really did produce some
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkably winter hardy lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plan was to bulk seed and replant
the next year for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work out, but we still got a
really, we got an effective result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: so four of them are on our list for
release this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intellectual property arrangements for
these peas will be guided by the ARS
[SPEAKER_00]: system since the initial crosses for all
but one of the varieties came from the ARS
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, Rebecca McGee out in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to make them public
releases such that a deposit will be held
[SPEAKER_00]: in Grin and will be available publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that we can maintain stock seed and
provide it to seed companies for trialing,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the farmer selected lines,
two of the farmers who participated run,
[SPEAKER_00]: one runs a seed company, Prairie Road
Organic Seed in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Doodle Farm sells various farm
products off their farm in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are the first right of refusal for
using those varieties on their farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can choose to also make them
available to other seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also have a right to,
we haven't been aiming to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: royalties on any of this, but if we did,
they would receive a share of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while our trial network allows
trialing, selection and trialing in many
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, there are only a few
locations that are cold enough to really
[SPEAKER_00]: provide selection pressure or evaluation
pressure for winter survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to more thoroughly test it,
and to introduce these winter peas or
[SPEAKER_00]: winter peas as cover crops at all to
farmers, this fall we are planning small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale winter pea trials with, we're hoping
to roll out with 60 farmers and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to get data back from 40 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that ratio plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use the seedling platform
that I described previously, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use a model where each farmer
will receive a subset of three varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: from the total of six, along with one
consistent check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a variation of the Tricot
design, which stands for Triadic
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparison of Three, which was proposed by
Jacob Bennett and the Sunating Heads a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically conducts statistical
analysis by comparison, by comparing rank
[SPEAKER_00]: among cultivars instead of by asking
farmers to phenotype or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it creates ranks out of phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond those trials, this season,
which will be on a relatively small scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: how could we use participatory methods or
community science methods to inform our
[SPEAKER_00]: work and to expand the reach of these
cultivars that we're producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already have plans for the
participatory work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three of the most engaged viable
growers from the participatory pea
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project have re-engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have peas in their fields this year,
and we are excited to see what comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, some ideas are coalescing
in the literature and in practice around a
[SPEAKER_00]: community science approach to
participatory variety trialing,
[SPEAKER_00]: some elements of which showed up in the
Kenobi project and even the beet breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So features of this approach are having
multiple points of entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody has to have a full on
selection experiment at their farm every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety trials, especially smaller scale
ones where you maybe only have three
[SPEAKER_00]: things to compare, are often easier for
farmers to commit to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also even lower stakes ways to
engage, like participatory field days,
[SPEAKER_00]: where farmers might flag or rate on a
survey breeding lines or varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: they find particularly appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, these community science approaches
make use of the ubiquitous digital
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that's around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data submission using various manners
of smartphone apps, sometimes soil
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring devices that are low cost and
easy and small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using modern data science to derive
meaning from big, noisy, decentralized
[SPEAKER_00]: on-farm data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method was introduced by Jacob
Edneton's group at SEOT in 2019,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least that's when it was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several recent studies have built on
this design, one using bean in Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America, integrated weather data with
farmer observation, to discover drivers of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental variation and then predict
variety suitability for various regions in
[SPEAKER_00]: much more precise ways than could have
been done before a group, including
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean-Luc, recently published on the way
data-driven decentralized breeding can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks worked on a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this decentralized model allows
scaling of environmental and management
[SPEAKER_00]: data to meet the scale of genomic data,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Holly Tupin was also part of the brand
new PNAS paper describing how these
[SPEAKER_00]: data-driven approaches can incorporate
social data, environmental data,
[SPEAKER_00]: even economic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like being able to reflect some of
these values that surround breeding in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to crop agronomic performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all very intriguing ideas and
could have relevance to our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in the big data approaches
potentially because we have a big network,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're spread over all these
institutions who each have connections
[SPEAKER_00]: with groups of farmers that are already
coalesced and already have interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So convening the people is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These approaches have been used in the
global south thus far, but cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: provide somewhat of a parallel use case in
the global north in that these crops are
[SPEAKER_00]: not as far along the domestication
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's common to find both named
varieties and farmer saved seed or variety
[SPEAKER_00]: not stated seed coexisting in this seed
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that way, the situations are
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of elements of the network that are
not scaled to this level, but in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: an initial idea, I think it's an initial
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are putting the tricot in our
smaller scale trials this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what responses, what we need to
do to maximize engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one potential I see is that we're just
starting to work with rye, which has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more genomic tools available at this point
than our legume cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last point is however big our data
gets and however refined our predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: can be, we know that trust between farmers
and researchers is absolutely essential in
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the way any information that
comes out of our network and any varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that come out of our network actually meet
the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to all the funders of all these
projects I've presented on, and I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the Kenobi trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefit of working with these regional
groups is that they each have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are five about to initiative
regional coordinators and three of them
[SPEAKER_00]: work for these regional works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they have a lot of longevity in
their positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have these trusted relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were recruited through those
networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would give, you know, season kickoff
webinars for folks who were signed up or
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who were on the fence to communicate
directly between like me as the project
[SPEAKER_00]: manager and the farmers, but like the
biggest connections came through the
[SPEAKER_00]: regional coordinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like coordinating with groups that
already exist is really essential because
[SPEAKER_00]: like a network that big is really,
it's not wise to make it hinge on one
[SPEAKER_00]: person or one coordinator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the cover crop network, I'm assuming
most farmers to your having participated,
[SPEAKER_02]: having grown these mixtures before maybe
getting them management recommendations on
[SPEAKER_02]: how to manage that plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm newer to the cover crop world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, but what I'm gathering is some
people have grown fall sown cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, are used to the growing
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll give, we'll give sowing
recommendations for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, we'll have to talk about
how we structure it in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be some regional specificities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can like suggest planting dates for
your region, but like what we did with
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenobi was, you know, if you, if you learn
by conversation that a different planning
[SPEAKER_00]: date is better, please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like bottom line is we want them to
survive and then like, tell us what you
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like enough guidelines so that they get
a crop to survive if it's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if winter doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that it's so that our results
reflect the kind of on-farm management
[SPEAKER_00]: people could actually do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that surprised me, I guess,
is how much you talked about intellectual
[SPEAKER_03]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wondered how soon you begin that
conversation when you start working with
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ideally right away, like before you
agree to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it really depends on the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're working, especially through
an institution like, like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's really important to make sure
that, you know, the tech transfer folks
[SPEAKER_00]: are on board with what's your,
what's your ideas are, or you receive from
[SPEAKER_00]: them, what your restrictions might be so
that you don't get surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it, I think the saddest thing is to
make something cool and then have it
[SPEAKER_00]: either not get out into the world or have
it get out in a way that ruptures that
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between you and the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, as soon as possible, but it's a
complex landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something that you're interested in
or is it just like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I, those slides are new as of
yesterday because I gave a practice
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation to the CCB lab group and they
were like, how's about IP?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's a, it's an escapable in
the, in, in, in the seed system as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now, we can't pretend it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great place to like have to put
into practice, whatever values we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring to this thing and like, and to
negotiate compromises because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the Wisconsin beats, like,
you know, royalties are going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: university and people can have various
feelings about that, but we just decided,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's funding more grad work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was indirectly funded by
things like that through the grad school
[SPEAKER_00]: and the court department.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
