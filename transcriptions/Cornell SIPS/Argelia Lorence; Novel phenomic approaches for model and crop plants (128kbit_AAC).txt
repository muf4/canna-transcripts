[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to Olena and Mike and
the organizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real joy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first trip to the Mecca of plant
science in the U.S., so I'm really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I show you some of the
phenotyping data, let me explain what the
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Imaging Consortium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a consortium of Arkansas and
Missouri-based scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're funded by the NSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically we are a group of plant
scientists who came together, convinced of
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of plant hydropod
phenotyping and other imaging tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the project allowed us to do is
really open the access to some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: hydropod phenotyping and other imaging
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: to really empower discoveries in plant
stress biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to acknowledge some of my
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three scientific leads in
Missouri and two in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Missouri, the leads are Sylvia Jurison,
Joan Chuan Tai, and David Braun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Arkansas, the leads are Fiona
Goggin and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll tell you more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our website, and among the things
that we have done is funded young
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned yesterday that you're
getting an excellent one coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, coming back to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to see also here,
Noah Folgreen and Malia Gihan.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two very talented scientists,
and they got some funding from our
[SPEAKER_00]: consortium to really develop further Plant
CV, which is an open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Software, and it's really a community
resource where you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you what we have
contributed to this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure that I'm preaching here
to the choir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are biotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, of course, biotic stresses
present a big challenge to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need better ways to measure plant
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this interaction, the genes by
environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, we are convinced, and I
believe Todd already showed us,
[SPEAKER_00]: digital phenotyping is a very powerful
tool, because you go beyond the resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of the human eye to really extract all of
this important information out of these
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me discuss the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Arkansas, there is 50 plant
scientists throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have here a treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 80, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 50, and we are scattered in five
different universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came together and said, how can we
be more impactful?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came together and formed a virtual
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it the Plant Power Production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with NSF funding, we were able
to acquire this instrument because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking for things that will
empower us and go from descriptive science
[SPEAKER_00]: to quantitative science and go from a very
biased approach, which is manual
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping to an unbiased approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the system we acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scanalyzer HTS from Lemnatech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has four cameras, a visible camera,
a fluorescence camera, an infrared camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an infrared camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And already Todd told us some of the
benefits of each of these sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to bring to your attention
is we can phenotype Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can phenotype also the seedling stage
of many crops in this configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a deck that accommodates
plate and multi-well plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside of our system is there is
a finite space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot go beyond the B4, the
vegetative state of many crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the downside of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little bit more detail on the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visible camera, again, the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interrogate and get information
regarding size, architecture, and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the fluorescence camera, we can have
an indication of plant health through
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or with the special filters, we can
measure fluorescent proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for example, in hair roots that are
non-photosynthetic, we can measure
[SPEAKER_00]: phenolics.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the infrared camera, we can get
information regarding water content and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the infrared leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, why do we like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbiased, non-destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soderal phenotypes can be detected,
and this is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw images are permanently stored,
and you can come up later with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: question and interrogate the data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if careful metadata is kept,
I think there is a lot that can be gained
[SPEAKER_00]: by the overall combination of our
community if we deposit this data in
[SPEAKER_00]: places where it's public, where Olena can
interrogate my data, I can interrogate
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the throughput of our system is if we
do multi-well plates in the order of 8,000
[SPEAKER_00]: samples per run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for more, most of the assays we do
with plants in soil, between 18 and 45
[SPEAKER_00]: plants per run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a run usually takes less than an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the system, mostly because
experiments that before it took me six
[SPEAKER_00]: months to get done, now I get them done in
four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also now I can manage a lot higher
number of samples, and then the statistics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the robustness of your data improves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my current team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the team does vitamin C
metabolism, which is my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love plants and biochemistry of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other half of my team really does
phenotyping for several universities in
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri and for all of the external users
we're serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very talented postdoc,
Dr. Sujin Liu.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who has developed all of the
algorithms applications that I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, very talented group of
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants we have the most experience
with are shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olena asked me to show an example with
Arabidopsis and one with a real crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna show rice today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are my examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to show you what we have done,
or one of the projects we have done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis, I'm gonna show you a
collaborative project with the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: of Dr. David Mendoza from the University
of Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Missouri, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an ionomics person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's into loving metals like several of
you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he loves metals and understanding how
metals are absorb and then transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have done in this article,
in this paper that we published recently
[SPEAKER_00]: is really do ionomics and phenomics in the
same plants under water limitation
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically here is the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We germinate Arabidopsis seeds in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select the robust seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transfer those to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have robust seedlings,
we divided them into four different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment groups, a control group and
three ones with water limitation
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants were phenotype every other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we measure, we make sure that we
are imposing water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the phenotyping with the
scanalyzer, we are also incorporating this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful instrument developed by David
Kramer's laboratory at Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Multispec-Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-destructive instrument that
allows you to do the same thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of costing you $60,000,
it costs $1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what we like is non-destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see great correlation between what
the data we are capturing with this
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument and the fluorescence data we
are getting with the scanalyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the ionomics person loves
his ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a little bit of the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, control and three water stress
conditions were showing you the images and
[SPEAKER_00]: the analyzed images.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this data set was analyzed with the
Lemnagrid software that we acquired with
[SPEAKER_00]: the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, really the big changes
in size of the plant come until you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: these levels of water limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the big surprise for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arabidopsis is very resilient and you
can get down up to 50% water and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no penalty in the growth of the vegetative
growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, look at what happened to seed
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even at this level, big,
big drop in seed yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found out is seed yield is a
lot more sensitive to water stress than
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the ionomics, what David
found is that the effect of drought is
[SPEAKER_00]: very element and very treatment-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I know several of you metal
lovers will bombard me with questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to illustrate some of the
power of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that Lucia Costa,
the PhD student that did this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed is that although from the images,
from the top, there was no difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf area between these two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: She noticed that there were more leaves
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where Dr. Liu developed for us
this beautiful strategy to count leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: more effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we found that under control
conditions, there were more leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This module for leaf counting has been
added to Plant CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I really encourage you to take
advantage of this great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply it to images that you
acquire within a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to necessarily take it with
any particular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really flexible, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so again, I couldn't not talk about
the scurvy biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a molecule that is my big
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on it for the last 14 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that plants have four
different ways to get to that molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very, very fortunate to be part
of the team that at Virginia Tech
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered this pathway that starts with
my inocito.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I moved to Arkansas State,
my students and I now have characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: at least one member of each one of these
gene families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we overexpress them, and here I'm
showing you what happens when we
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpress the first enzyme, this happens
to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are the same chronological
age, grown under the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the high vitamin C1, and this is
the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, looking for a way to quantify
this phenotype is what got me into
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go from pretty pictures to
okay, tell me how much bigger this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning, like all of you,
we did lots of manual phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have done is now validated
that all of the manual phenotyping we did
[SPEAKER_00]: was indeed correct, but now we have new
readouts of health that we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I just want to clarify this is the
wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the high vitamin C line,
and I'm using as controls two lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpress a proton pyrophosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line is very, very famous and used as
control because it's a known soil-tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: and drought-tolerant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've told you, color classification
is very powerful, but we were sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: limited with the lemna-grit approach
because we were only able to distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: green and yellow, but not different tones
of green, which is what we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Dr. Liu developed a color
classification approach that has given us
[SPEAKER_00]: much better resolution in understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what happens to wild type in
response to salt, and the transgenics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest color rates don't show this
yellow in phenotype that I should clarify
[SPEAKER_00]: is not noticeable with your naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm gonna switch now to rice to
show you an example with rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is funded by the Plant Genome
Program, and it's a collaboration with the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have, we have looked together for
novel sources of salt tolerance in rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my main collaborator is Harkam Alwale,
and he has done all of the phenotyping and
[SPEAKER_00]: the tillering and the panicle initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done the one at the seedling
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you, and this is,
I don't know if Susan is in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very familiar to you because it's
the rice diversity panel that Susan
[SPEAKER_00]: McCouche and her collaborators developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a wonderful resource for us
to find those novel genes involved in salt
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance in rice, an important problem in
the world, and certainly in Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main producer of rice in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beauty of this is it has a core
group that represents all five different
[SPEAKER_00]: subgroups of rice, and of course,
there is all of this genomic information
[SPEAKER_00]: that Susan and her group have made
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotyping, this was an obvious
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going after tissue tolerance,
not after ion exclusion as mode of action
[SPEAKER_00]: for salt tolerance, and the very beautiful
work that Harkam Alwale has done is he did
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the, all of this work at the
Australian Accelerator, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and developed a pipeline for the visible
images and a pipeline for the fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should emphasize for the fluorescent
images, a very talented undergrad in his
[SPEAKER_00]: lab wrote this software that is also very
powerful for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Image Harvest, which will be,
I guess, the cousin of PlantCV,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is another approach of an open
source software to analyze these type of
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harkam Alwale already has found candidate
genes and is already validating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, this was at the tailoring
stage, and here's his publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you a little bit what I have
done at Arkansas State.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, with minority undergrads,
14 of them knowing nothing about science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have come to my lab for the summer,
and they have generated publication
[SPEAKER_00]: quality data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Harkam Alwale sent the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have healthy seedlings,
we transfer them to this hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just calcinated clay to provide
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this phenotyping trace in these
tops, and this is where we put Yoshida
[SPEAKER_00]: solution as a control group, and we set up
an idea with identical trace, but with
[SPEAKER_00]: salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first experiment we did,
this was our control group, and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: providing the salt in three different
steps, but we were not seeing a robust
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, so we went a little bit more
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all of the data I'm gonna show you,
the black line is our control,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made the salt in three increments
and phenotype during the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let me show you the result with a
known salt-tolerant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the representative images of the
line treated just with Yoshida solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a salt-loving line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our digital readouts completely back what
the images say, and manual phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: also backs what we saw with the
salt-tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a salt-tolerant
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this line grew better than the
control, and the manual phenotyping we did
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the experiment should fully
backs up these results, and as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine, most of the lines were
salt-sensitive, where the treatment grew a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less than the control, and again,
the manual phenotyping fully backs that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the interesting thing is that although
your eyes cannot see it, the instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to tell us there was a lot more
yellowing in the plants treated with,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, in the salt-treated ones
versus the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm showing here just a group of
the lines, not all of them, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: these 14 students have allowed me to now
phenotype 200 of the lines of the right
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gone through the analysis of
84,000 images.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Todd was saying, very big data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to develop a different set of
skills to handle that amount of data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just want to finish telling you that
we are a core facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We accept new users, and whether you
already have the money to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment or are thinking about getting
the money to do the experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are happy to talk to you and to help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a resource for the plant science
community, and we hope you find this
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague, Dr. John Trantai,
wants me to tell you that he has this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful pet imaging system at Washington
University at St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an incredible scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed, he made this on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really amazing, and Margaret
already showed you the power of this
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, and I'm sure Chris will share
some of the power of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, as a biochemist, it's just so
amazing to see how the carbon that was
[SPEAKER_00]: given in the leaves suddenly can be
monitored in a plant that is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My closing slide is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to tell you I really believe
there is the need for more cooperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful to the opportunity to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope there is a lot of opportunity for
interaction, collaboration, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I encourage you to get very much
involved in the North American Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotyping Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group of people that we are all
enthusiasts about phenotyping and about
[SPEAKER_00]: learning together and making of this a
more vibrant community in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, so please contact me or any of my
colleagues involved on this, and with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I'll be very happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dream is, or not only dream,
one of the goals of the Plant Imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: Consortium is to develop a database where
we can all put the data, but we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have also the tool to allow people to
analyze their data, so we really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: write things that were compatible with
Plant CV, because we really think an open
[SPEAKER_00]: source software will be a much easier way
to handle things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my postdoc wrote completely a new
algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors were the same, the images were
the exact same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
