[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Wojtek, and thank you,
Adrienne, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, I'm going to talk about plant
development, so not my oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the field a little bit in the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so my question today is, how do plants
read their own shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a bit of a cryptic question,
but it's a way to address the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical signals in developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's going to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that's for sure is that
there's a lot of data in the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that cells are able to sense their
mechanical environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing, for instance, is that if
you grow a single cell on a micropattern
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, you can actually predict the
orientation of the spindle and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is due to the fact that because
the adhesion pattern is biased by the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, then you biased also the spindle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the force within the cell that
is guiding the spindle orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that has been shown also for
cell division is that if you compress or
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch a cell, you're going to accelerate
or decelerate the mitotic progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another one that is maybe even
stronger, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow stem cells, so mesenchymal
stem cells, on substrate, so it has
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same chemical composition,
the only difference is the stiffness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow those stem cells on soft
matrices, you get a neuroblast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow the same stem cell on a stiff
matrix, you get an osteoblast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that the mechanical
environment, or in this case, the matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: is defining the cell fate in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's also interesting is that you
have this relation with stiffness,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the entire cell is actually changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow those stem cells,
they're going to have a more dense
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have more cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the nucleus is going to become
stiffer on a stiffer medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you completely reprogram the cell based
on the mechanical environment of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is at the single cell level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of data at the single
cell level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fewer data at the multicellular
level, of course, because it's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also more complex to interpret
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general idea would be that you
have a gene network here in one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is impacting the mechanical
properties of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is changing the shape of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is changing the shape of the overall
organ tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, in turn, because there is growth
in there, there is pressure, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical stress here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, in turn, could feed back on the gene
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that at this point,
this is a mechanism that is allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue or the cells to know where they
are, or the tissue, what size it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a sensing mechanism for shape,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you read mechanical signals,
you can know your shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buffer your size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, let's say, the conceptual
framework for this reading shape thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm focusing on the mechanical
signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there are other signals,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do the same feedback loop with
biochemical signals only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that here, I'm looking at
the contribution of mechanical signals in
[SPEAKER_00]: this feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the fact that there is mechanical
stress in this tissue can be a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to clarify this point with
some very basic images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a bunch of rods piled
together, now you put the threads between
[SPEAKER_00]: those rods.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens here is that this structure
is stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's metastable, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, what is in this structure is
a balance between tension and compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the threads here are under tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rods are under compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to simplify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this balance between tension and
compression that makes this structure
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, this is very theoretical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it applies to shapes and biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take probably the simplest shape
you can imagine, a balloon or a sphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: a balloon is a stable shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's stable because there is a gas
inside that is under compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an envelope that is under
tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the balance between tension and
compression that allows the balloon to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stable in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also generate flat shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a balance between tension and
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kite example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have two rods under compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the membrane that is under tension is
pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this balance, you can have flat
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can generate any
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the modern architecture is
all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know about the brutalist
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any architecture, you can use this
feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so all this is for buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could ask a question of whether
it's applicable to a living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, an animal example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go through a section of a human
femur, you see this pattern of trabeculae
[SPEAKER_00]: in the femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very intricate, very organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also see that there is a
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut several femur, you always
see this kind of overall pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you calculate the pattern of
mechanical stress in this tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see here that there is tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, there's compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the weight that you put on
your femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see also is that this pattern
of stress is matching the overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pillars in the femur, the trabeculae
orientation in the femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that the bone is building to
resist to mechanical stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you build the pillar to resist,
in this case, mainly to compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit like in a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build a vertical wall to resist
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is for a solid medium,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are working on is soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, it's soft matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this true also for soft matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I take the example of the Stavan
et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: paper in 2011, where what is looked at is
a mouse intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this spring shape,
I would say, like this circumvoluted
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to know, is there any
forces in this structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it did was an analog model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you take two pieces of rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stretch one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you glue the two pieces together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you get is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape of this structure is relatively
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the same scale, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shape itself, the geometry,
is relatively similar to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an indication that maybe in
this structure, there is also a balance
[SPEAKER_00]: between tension and compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what is generating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, that's something you can even
feel when you do a dissection of a mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get to the intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very springy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fits with this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best, actually, demonstration is
to do the reverse experiment, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: take your intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cut the mesentery, so the two
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that the tube is
expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mesentery is contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it reveals that there was a
balance between tension and compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm going to stop here for
the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plants, it's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in all living organisms,
it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a balance between tension
and compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should never say always.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, there is a balance between
tension and compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm just taking an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the radishes, it's a classic example
that I like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do a radish salad, the first
thing you do is that you cut the radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pop open because the epidermis is
under tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tissue inside is under
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a classic example is the
rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have rhubarb and you peel the
epidermis or the cortex of the rhubarb,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do that in water to avoid
dehydration, you see that the cortex is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to contract, which means that it was
under compression, under tension before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We peel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here, I just want to quote
Carl's work here because this is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important paper summarizing this idea and
going into more detail to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, it's the epidermis, usually in
most tissues, in most plant tissues,
[SPEAKER_00]: or high tissue, usually, that are under
tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has a primary role in growth and
morphogenesis for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now into what we are doing more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is just a scheme that I stole from
Jacques Dumet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really simplified scheme of a plant
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pressure inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell wall is resisting to this
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have aligned cellulose
microfibrils that are driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of growth of this cell,
which is orthogonal to the cellulose
[SPEAKER_00]: microfibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to this audience, I don't need to
go into full details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, I guess, all aware of this fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what is controlling the
deposition of the cellulose microfibrils?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's generally accepted is that it's the
macrotribules that are guiding the
[SPEAKER_00]: deposition of cellulose in the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have a piece of the plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cellulose synthase is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extruding cellulose inside the cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just beneath the plasma membrane,
you have the cortical macrotribules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cellulose synthase is basically
moving along the macrotribules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most tissues, actually,
the more we get data and live imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: data, the more we see this type of
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we can easily image
macrotribule dynamics with GFP markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can have an indirect image of the
deposition of cellulose inside the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you may understand, cellulose is
much more difficult to image because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really put any fluorescent marker
for the cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an indirect image of cellulose
deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have an indirect image of the
mechanical properties of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that cellulose is as stiff
as steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have an idea of in which
direction the cell wall is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stiffer than the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the mechanical anisotropy of the
cell wall with the orientation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: macrotribules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with an example on
which we worked the past few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the payment cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, what you see is a young
Arabidopsis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have two cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the cotyledons,
you see those cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: interdigitated, that have a jigsaw puzzle
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see a stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a typical shape for epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not for all epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Arabidopsis, at least, it's very
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a very well-known
cell type, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of experiments done on
payment cells because it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we know is that we know
actually it's been characterized already
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cytoskeleton, and in particular
for the macrotribules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the cotyledon is in the expansion
phase, so when it grows at fast speed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the macrotribules within one payment cell
has a stereotypical pattern in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: see those rings of macrotribules between
the necks of the payment cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the lobes, there is less
macrotribules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of a bimodal distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you have a lot of
macrotribules that are aligned in the
[SPEAKER_00]: necks and less in the lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, when you see that,
and if you feel like the cellulose is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be oriented the same way here,
what we should see is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more macrotribules, so more
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a ring of cellulose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could explain why you have a
jigsaw puzzle shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only indirect evidence that
this is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some staining for cellulose,
for the macrotribule, but no mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements for the stiffness of payment
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was to adapt atomic force
microscopy to measure the mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of those cells at very high
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in two words, atomic force microscopy
is actually sort of an old technique now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's been used a lot in material
sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use here a cantilever, the
micrometric cantilever, or maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit bigger than a micrometric,
with a nanometric tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the little, the cantilever we use
at the end, the radius is at two
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometer, so it's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we apply this cantilever on the
surface, and with a laser, we can measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the curving or the deflection of the
cantilever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the cantilever is applied on a stiff
surface, it's going to bend immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's applied on a soft surface,
it's going to indent the substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's going to bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can measure the delay in bending,
if you want, with the laser that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be proportional to the stiffness of
your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know the stiffness of your
cantilever, then you can deduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: material properties of your tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, here we use a very small
tip, like two nanometer, to only indent a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of the cell wall, and just to
have the local mechanical properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the type of image we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get the topography, of course,
with these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have here the boundary between two
pavement cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, again, the jigsaw puzzle
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the curvature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this scale, it's very, very bumpy,
as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bumpy, but smooth, in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, if we get the force measurements,
so the mechanical properties, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: type of map we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's white, it's stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's black, it's soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should make a little disclaimer
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really white zone or the really
black zone are probably artifacts or zones
[SPEAKER_00]: that we cannot really interpret,
because it's too sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the cantilever is indenting
on something that is at an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what we're measuring,
so we prefer to ignore those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you focus on the relatively
flat part, of the cell, you see those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see some white lines here,
some white lines here, here, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are matching the microtubule pattern
that we saw earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, that would mean that
there is some wall reinforcement along
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines between the necks in those
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want one evidence that,
indeed, those cells are reinforced along
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines, matching the predicted
cellulose deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a positive control, which is the
stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you may know, in stomata,
the microtubules and the cellulose is
[SPEAKER_00]: transverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see also transverse stiffening in
those tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this model, I mean, which it has
been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conceptually, it's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more evident that it's true,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, now the question is,
what is orienting the microtubules?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how come the microtubules are orienting
like this and relatively stable during
[SPEAKER_00]: this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one possibility is that it's actually
mechanical stress that would orient those
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's only mechanical
stress, but there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we want to test whether it's
mechanical stress that can orient those
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to test this hypothesis, Pavel
Krubinsky in the Henry Johnson lab did a
[SPEAKER_00]: model in which he could calculate the
tension in the top wall of those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you take a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put pressure in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a cell wall that is under
tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the cell wall was a half sphere,
it was just the shape of a half sphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tension would be the same in all
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be isotropic mechanical
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because here, we start with a
puzzle-shaped cell like this, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the red lines, which are the
maximal tension lines, you see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: converge in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neck regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the prediction of the
tension in this top wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that it's converging in those
necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there is a good match
between the predicted maximal tension line
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern and the orientation of the
microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hence the idea that maybe the
microtubules are able to sense somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: these tension lines and align to resist to
this mechanical stress or to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose to resist to this mechanical
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you have to show that there is
tension in this tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one movie to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it might be a leaf in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take this tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit like in the rhubarb
experiment or in the radish experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it, you should reveal the
pattern of stress in this tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we've removed the large part of
the cotyledon when we cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that it keeps opening
after it's been cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that it is under tension
indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I should play it again.
Check.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not really a surprise,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with what we've seen before,
now it's really accumulating evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: the epidermis is under tension in plant
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can do a model in which we put
the epidermis under tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at the pattern of stress in
this tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do an ablation and
predict the orientation of the mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: stress pattern after ablation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, what Pavel did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ablate those cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can forget about the color code.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see is a circumferential
orientation of the stress here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you take a piece of paper,
you cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for it not to tear, you need to enforce
it around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the predicted pattern of
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, if you do it on a real cotyledon,
that's what you see, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you ablate a large piece of the
cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this orientation of the
microtubules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, since then, we've tried to do
this ablation at different stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a good match between the
growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do that when the cotyledon is
not really growing anymore, you have less
[SPEAKER_00]: of a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need to do this at the
fast-growing rate, which makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the stress would be the
highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is evidence that, indeed,
the microtubule can reorient to a line
[SPEAKER_00]: along maximal tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there is other experiments
that I'm not going to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do compressions or if you do
pharmacological treatment to soften the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall, for instance, to increase the
stress level, you also see the same type
[SPEAKER_00]: of reorientation of the microtubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the general idea, then,
is that a cell with its microtubule is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to reinforce its cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to, OK, that's what you see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a different color code,
but the pink is stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you reinforce the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is controlling the cell shape or
stabilizing the cell shape, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shape itself is prescribing a
pattern of mechanical stress that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in turn, is controlling the microtubules,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, if you start with a
puzzle shape, you're more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a puzzle shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to go towards a balloon
shape because of this feedback loop,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a way to go back to the
reading shape idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this cell is able to read its own
shape through this mechanical feedback and
[SPEAKER_00]: to amplify or to stabilize its shape
through this mechanical feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now if we move at a larger scale,
so now it dates back like a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some work in the shoot
apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an arabidopsis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remove the flowers, then you get to
this dome of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the shoot apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowers are on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we use this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can do a lot of things with the
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, we use this system as a
morphogenetic model, in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a tissue with a specific shape,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tissue folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to see whether what we
showed for the pavement cell is also true
[SPEAKER_00]: for the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at microtubules in this
meristem, so this is viewed from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the center of the meristem would be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a young organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an older organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see these alignments of
microtubules here between the organ and
[SPEAKER_00]: the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here, an alignment of
microtubule between the organ and the
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see this alignment of microtubule
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is stereotypical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always see this alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pattern in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really like a constant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time you look at the meristem with a
microtubule marker, this is what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, we can make the analogy
with the pavement cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have here the meristem,
especially in the boundaries where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an organ, the meristem, and you have
this alignment, supra-cellular alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: of microtubule in the boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks a little bit like in pavement cell,
where you also have this alignment of
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubule between necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, it's at the single cell level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's supra-cellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you forgot about the sub-cell
division or the cells, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have tension lines, and the
microtubules are aligned again.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so is this true?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, again, assume that the
epidermis is under tension, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the pattern of stress in this
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you find is that at the top,
because it's a half sphere, the stress is
[SPEAKER_00]: isotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no direction, no preferential
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the stem, it's a cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the circumferential stress is going to
be twice higher than the actual stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is well-known in engineering
and mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, for instance, why when you boil
sausages, they're going to open
[SPEAKER_00]: lengthwise, because the stress in the
circumferential orientation is larger than
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you would see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the epidermis is under tension,
the tension is going to be higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: circumferential orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the actual orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the boundary domain here,
so it's a bit of the mix between this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this starts to be on the side of the
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts to become a bit more like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition, you have an organ here
that is growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it grows fast, it's going to
compress the cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have compression in this
orientation and tension in that
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of tension, it's really,
really anisotropic, very directional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have a strong tension in that
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when you see this,
it's a little bit like in the femur,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I showed you earlier, like the
Darcy-Thomson or the wall flow on femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that you have a good match between
the predicted pattern of stress and the
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation of the microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, so we did a number of
experiments to change the pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical stress and see if the
microtubule would reorient along the new
[SPEAKER_00]: stress pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show one,
just the simplest one, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's an ablation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, again, a model with the
tension on the top wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do an ablation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we predict a circumferential
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like in the cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we do the experiment,
which has been done by Marcus Eisler,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here you have the microtubule,
the cell shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the merged image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use a UV laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you burn two cells, one or two cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what happens right afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you let the microtubules reorient
and they reorient circumferentially around
[SPEAKER_00]: the ablation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is not enough to fully
prove that it's a response to mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lots of chemicals that are induced by
wounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do compression, you see the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can do other experiments
that show that, indeed, each time you
[SPEAKER_00]: change the stress pattern, each time you
change the microtubule orientation,
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we're saying is that
it's a general rule in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you have microtubules,
you're going to change the shape via the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on cellulose deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shape itself is going to prescribe
a pattern of mechanical stress that in
[SPEAKER_00]: turn is going to orient the microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this feedback loop is a
way to read tissue shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the tissue is able to read the
tissue folding at the meristem boundary
[SPEAKER_00]: and amplify the folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this feedback loop would
help the organ to move out of the meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be more quickly separated,
physically separated from the meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: with this feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the problem with, of course,
the feedback loop is that it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could imagine that we've lost
the biology in this because white's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kick first, and then that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no regulation, which can be an
advantage in biology because you have less
[SPEAKER_00]: control, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess in biology, we usually like to
see some regulation for these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially because we know that shape
can be modulated by the environment or the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what could be the regulation for this
feedback loop?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've started to touch upon this by
looking at regulators of microtubule
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, what we found is that
the catanin, so the catanin is a molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors that cuts the microtubules and
increase the microtubule dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that in a mutant for
the catanin gene or the catanin protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a slower microtubule dynamics,
but we also have a slower response to
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could imagine that by playing with
catanin activity, we could have a feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: loop that is going to be more or less
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can imagine that you can
modify or modulate the shape by modulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the catanin, but again, playing with this
overall context of the mechanical feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found also some interesting
consequences on growth heterogeneity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not going to go into this detail
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question we have for this is the
mechanotransduction pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can a cell sense tension?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of data in the animal
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mechanotransduction pathways
that are identified in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is formally no, or maybe there's
some indication in plants about
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanotransduction pathways, but there is
no formal demonstration of a full
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanotransduction pathway in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an open area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm just going to pinpoint one
maybe piece of data to show whether what
[SPEAKER_00]: we found is actually making sense with
what we know about the microtubules in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know is that the microtubules
are extremely dynamic, so they polymerize,
[SPEAKER_00]: depolymerize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are cut all the time, and they can
also zipper, so they can bundle with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the standard situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microtubules self-organize constantly,
and so that's the way they can change
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you put that in an isotropic
environment, well, you might have more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less bundling, but this is not going to
give you a direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to bias the direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we relate that to tension?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some data showing that if you
put the microtubule under tension,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to promote the polymerization
of the microtubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microtubule is going to polymerize
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put the microtubule under
compression, it's going to depolymerize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's going to depolymerize very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go through catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to just very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even see on movies in front of
your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the microtubule really going
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you add this in the mix of the
self-organization, then it's logic that
[SPEAKER_00]: the microtubules would align along the
maximal tension, because you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: favor the microtubules that are under
tension and destroy, if you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microtubules that are under
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this is self-organized in a way,
you're going to have more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules bundling in the direction of
maximal tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is based on data in animal cells,
also in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems it would be something pretty
general, this response.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it makes sense that plant cells
would have used this for their response.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to conclude, I'm just going to go
back to the animal world, just to expand a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea that gene expression can be
impacted by mechanical forces is not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the few examples where
people have looked at this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a drosophila embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, what you do, what Emmanuel Farge
did was to indent, to push on an embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this gene in green,
twist, is ectopically expressed after this
[SPEAKER_00]: compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very artificial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how often is a drosophila embryo
pushed by a microindentor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess not too often in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, what's interesting is that
this gene is expressed in domain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but during gastrulation, is experiencing
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that maybe during evolution,
there is tissue movement, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: during gastrulation, actually,
where you have patterns, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: of compression and tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can affect gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, more recently, last year,
actually, he showed the same thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: zebrafish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's spectacular here is that,
so here, you have the gastrulation in a
[SPEAKER_00]: drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cells are compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you induce twist in zebrafish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is epiboli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have tissue movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you induce no tail, which would be the
equivalent of twist here, through the same
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanotransduction pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's a beta-catenin
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really shows that it might be a very
well-conserved mechanism in all living
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least, we can say, in two filets
that are very, very distant, between the
[SPEAKER_00]: drosophila and the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what's interesting in this
study, and here is really going beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of the art, is these genes,
so twist and no tail, they are really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical for mesoderm differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mesoderm differentiation, that's
really big in animal development,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is like, well, a lot of
things are derived from the mesoderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been looking for the molecular
cue that would trigger mesoderm
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one has found the gene that would
really be important for mesoderm
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Emmanuel is proposing is that
it's because we haven't found the gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's also, of course,
there are genes involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trigger, the triggering event,
could be this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is like the next
boundary, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so with that, I'll stop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a number of people to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the team in Lyon, I'm working with
Alex Kiboudaoude, who is a theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: physicist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work I've showed was mainly done by
Benoît Landrain, Pascal Miani for the FM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Magali Riteval for the Catanin
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a little bit on cell division with
Marion, Vincent, some modeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Maria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people involved in imaging
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan and Mathilde are involved in the
SIPL analysis project with Adrian and
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't talked at all about the SIPL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we had talked a lot this week in
the workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some interesting data coming
up soon, I would say, from this
[SPEAKER_00]: consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work on pavement cell was done in
collaboration with the team of Henry
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson and Eliott Mirovitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this overall project actually was
initiated by Yves Coudaire, again a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical physicist, and Jan Tras.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
