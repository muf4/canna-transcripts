[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody, for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a beautiful day, so I
appreciate you spending time in the dark
[SPEAKER_05]: room with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to present some data from my
second year of field work and a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of lab work and just a select bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before we can get into the data,
I want to talk about cover crops for a
[SPEAKER_05]: minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're part of the Sustainable Cropping
System Lab, and the bulk of my research is
[SPEAKER_05]: about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like typically this is how most
people think of cover crops as a vast
[SPEAKER_05]: expanse of aesthetically pleasing plants
that you're going to sow before or after
[SPEAKER_05]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And aside from providing excellent habitat
for lab managers, there are a whole suite
[SPEAKER_05]: of really good reasons to grow cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an evaluation of ecosystem
services provided by cover crops from
[SPEAKER_05]: Skipp Hansi, 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black line is cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gray is a rotation system that does not
include cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: The farther away from the central point,
the greater that ecosystem service is
[SPEAKER_05]: expressed when you use cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see you have a very diverse
range of things that cover crops can give
[SPEAKER_05]: you, from nitrogen to wheat suppression,
pest suppression, and mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when farmers are surveyed about why
they want to use cover crops, the three
[SPEAKER_05]: things that come up, the top three reasons
that a farmer might want to grow cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crops, to improve soil health,
to increase soil organic matter,
[SPEAKER_05]: and to reduce soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So soil health is a little bit beyond my
expertise, and I know depending on who you
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to, the definition changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these latter two, organic matter and a
reduction in erosion, absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: correlated to cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very important that when we're
working with farmers and we're having them
[SPEAKER_05]: grow cover crops, we want a lot of
biomass, because that's going to express
[SPEAKER_05]: these ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cover crops, there's a positive
correlation with weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more biomass of your cover crops,
you get fewer weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you grow something like vetch or clover
in your mixture, they're going to put out
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of flowers to attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those nice thick root systems increase
worm abundance, reduces phosphorus
[SPEAKER_05]: loading.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one downside is the more cover crop
biomass that you have, you have a reduced
[SPEAKER_05]: reduction in soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is typically why, as you go to
drier areas, cover crop utilization is a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit less than over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe seed predation, we're going to
get into that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know everybody sitting here thinking,
oh my god, if cover crops give us all
[SPEAKER_05]: these amazing things, surely farmers
everywhere are growing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I thought, but I was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a map of the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cooler colors, this is percent of
cropland with cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cooler color is blues and greens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less cover crop being grown, the warmer
colors is more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So New York is actually up here,
not here.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10% of New York farmers, only 10%
implement cover crops into their farming
[SPEAKER_05]: practices, which is weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd think if you have all these great
services, why isn't everyone doing this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a couple reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a recent survey of farmers as
to what is dissuading them from using
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really just want to focus in on
these top two lines, time and labor
[SPEAKER_05]: required, and establishing the cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a big problem is, if we think of cover
crops like in the context of that first
[SPEAKER_05]: picture that I showed you, where we have
that beautiful field, in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: establish that, typically you have to
harvest your crop first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're growing corn and you don't
get to harvest until November and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: snows two weeks later, the window for
establishing your cover crop is very
[SPEAKER_05]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what if I told you there was a way
that we could increase establishment and
[SPEAKER_05]: reduce the time required to do it so that
everyone could grow cover crops?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, almost everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is indeed a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is interseeded cover crops,
which is sort of the meat of my project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the agroecological gift that
keeps giving.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you plant early summer with the corns
young, and it grows throughout the
[SPEAKER_05]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the following spring,
you have that really nice expression of
[SPEAKER_05]: the full mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at each of these points,
you should be able to capitalize on all
[SPEAKER_05]: those ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a couple methods that people
use to do interseeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to go over a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is aerial broadcasting, red clover
seeds into soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there are some drawbacks with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the seeds, it's possible they're
not going to actually hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might get caught up in some of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very much at the mercy of the wind
and the rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you spread your cover crops by
broadcasting and you don't get rain for a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple weeks, your establishment's going
to be way low.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a potential better way to do this might
be with something like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're still interseeding here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these hoses are just sort of dropping
cover crops into those interrows of the
[SPEAKER_05]: corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a little better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ensure that the cover crops are
actually getting to the ground,
[SPEAKER_05]: not getting muddled in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you still have this problem that
if there's a big strong wind, you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: going to have cover crops in nice straight
rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's one more technique that when I
first started reading about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, new, progressive, really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's kind of old and progressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a picture from 1964.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high billoy interseeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's happening here is that the soil
is being opened up so the cover crops can
[SPEAKER_05]: be planted directly into the soil in
between rows of corn or soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the benefits of this is that you're
increasing the contact of the seeds with
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a little more protected if you
don't get rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as an example, I really like this
chart.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have days after planting your cover
crop on the x-axis, seedling count per
[SPEAKER_05]: meter squared on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were looking at cereal grains as
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I want you to focus on,
these triangles, these are cover crops
[SPEAKER_05]: that have been drill interseeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys were just broadcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this middle one was broadcast and then
disked.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, they found a significant
increase in your seedling count.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you drill interseed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really something that would be
good for more farmers to implement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another really exciting thing about drill
interseeding is how well they suppress
[SPEAKER_05]: interrow weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is from a paper out last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we're just talking about corn
today, just focus on the corn graphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the black bars, no cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the interrows, the white bar has cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a significant reduction in
weed density, both between the rows and
[SPEAKER_05]: within the rows, which they considered
about 10 centimeters either side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when you're interseeding,
there are some considerations you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: take into account for yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you drill interseed your cover crops
too early, they can affect the
[SPEAKER_05]: establishment of your corn and affect
subsequent yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that we know everything there is to
know about interseeded cover crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can talk about my actual project.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are three broad topics I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first is the effects of corn planting
density on interseeded cover crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: the biomass and corn yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the effects of cover crop biomass on
weed seed predation and seed preference of
[SPEAKER_05]: weed seed predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to address this first one, we set up
three experiments last summer,
[SPEAKER_05]: or three replicates of the same
experiment, I should say.
[SPEAKER_05]: One at Cornell, one down in Penn State,
and one in Maryland at USDA Bark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the experiment was set up in a
randomized complete block design with four
[SPEAKER_05]: blocks at each site.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had four planting densities.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were our treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero corn plants per hectare, so that was
our one control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a low, medium, and high plants
per hectare, so 37, 74,000, and 111,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were all interseeded with cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to say we had a fifth
treatment, which was this medium planting
[SPEAKER_05]: density that had no cover crop interseeded
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plot sizes were 12 by 14 meters.
[SPEAKER_05]: We applied nitrogen as poultry litter,
280 kilograms per hectare, assuming about
[SPEAKER_05]: 50% availability for the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used flexier corn seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cover crop mix was mixed up by Dave
Wilson in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had hairy vetch, cereal rye,
red clover, and annual ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the two legumes here, before everything
was seeded, were mixed with an inoculum
[SPEAKER_05]: just to help them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to give everybody a sense of field
operations and why I was skipping class at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of last year's semester,
fertilizer application.
[SPEAKER_05]: In early May, mold borer and disking that
the following day and planting on that
[SPEAKER_05]: same day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two blind cultivation events.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is essentially dragging a very
large rake behind the tractor,
[SPEAKER_05]: which has set it a pressure that's enough
to pull up the weeds that have emerged,
[SPEAKER_05]: but not quite enough to hurt the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once the corn gets a little
bigger, you have to switch methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did interrow cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just targeting in between the
crop rows with the s-tyne there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just a little more than a month
after we planted the corn, we interseeded
[SPEAKER_05]: the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now biomass of the cover crops were
sampled at two dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is approximately 50 and 100 days
after we interseeded just from two
[SPEAKER_05]: quadrats in each of those treatments that
we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like this series of photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about halfway in between these two
sample dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: At zero plants per hectare, 37 plants per
hectare, and 111.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our control, excuse me,
low and high planting density of the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see this nice difference in
the biomass of the cover crop and the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of light that's getting down to the
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at some results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have all three of the sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
corn planting density.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is expressed in plants per meter
squared, not in plants per hectare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can just think about this as no
corn, low, medium, and high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the log of the cover crop
biomass, grams per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is in that first sampling date,
so 50 days after we interseeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see this really nice relationship,
where as you increase the corn density,
[SPEAKER_05]: the biomass of cover crop decreases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So significant in all three sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this trend continued.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the exact same axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only change here is that we're looking
at the 110 day, so that's the second
[SPEAKER_05]: sampling date.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, some very nice regression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the takeaway here was cover crop
biomass was greater in lower corn planting
[SPEAKER_05]: densities in all three sites at both
sample dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is pretty consistent with a few
papers that have been written on the
[SPEAKER_05]: subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can tell farmers, hey, if you plant
at lower densities, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_05]: more cover crop biomass, and you're going
to get all these ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you'll get more of ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the other thing we have to take into
consideration here is yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't make sense to tell farmers
to plant at low densities if the yield is
[SPEAKER_05]: no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a nonlinear model of corn
density, again, on our x-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And grain yield, this is 15.5% moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grain yield expressed in grams per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dashed line in each of the three
sites, that's the asymptote.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sort of the maximum grain yield you'll
get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see we got a pretty good yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our three treatments, low, medium,
and high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there was no corn where we
didn't plant any.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the takeaway from this is that there is
a bit of a trade-off between cover crop
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass and corn yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you get the most biomass when you
don't plant corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But farmers need to plant the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think based on these data,
which I should repeat, this is one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a drought year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was using flexier corn seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in that context, I think there really
is a potential to find the equilibrium
[SPEAKER_05]: between a little bit of a lower planting
density to maximize cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I think we can actually talk about
some bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the effects of cover crop biomass on
weed seed predation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of sampling for weed seed
predation was we were hoping that after we
[SPEAKER_05]: established this gradient of cover crop
biomass to see if weed seed predation
[SPEAKER_05]: follows that gradient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get too much into it,
we actually have to talk about weed seed
[SPEAKER_05]: predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to say, in every other
field, so if we're talking ecology or
[SPEAKER_05]: entomology, these are just herbivores or
granivores.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really just in the weed science
circles that they're called weed seed
[SPEAKER_05]: predators, which makes them sound stronger
and sexier, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is sort of the poster child of
weed seed predation research.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Harpolis pensylvanicus,
which is the dingy ground beetle.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're native to this part of the
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very abundant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one that I spotted in
September feeding on ragweed seeds before
[SPEAKER_05]: seed rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So seed predation has been really
extensively researched for a few decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean to focus only on
invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Birds and mice are very important seed
predators as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like talking about bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But typically what we find is it's highly
variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of studies that research seed
predation look at sort of a binary choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a no-till or a tillage system?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you use herbicides and pesticides,
or is it organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the edges like around the field?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of weed is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't make these broad statements
that weed seed predation is the same for
[SPEAKER_05]: all plant species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something like velvet leaf,
which has very large, very hard seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: typically are not as often consumed as
something like foxtail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also depends on the quality of that
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how old is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much water it's imbibed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's been buried at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, in an attempt not to
broadcast and stereotype all these seed
[SPEAKER_05]: predators, seed preference changes
depending on what you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even in something like carabid
beetles, two beetles may have very
[SPEAKER_05]: different preferences because they have
different body sizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have different strength mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the time of the year can also
influence things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But despite all this variability,
there have been a couple studies that have
[SPEAKER_05]: shown that seed predation is actually
doing something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're eating the weed seeds and
they're actually having an effect on weed
[SPEAKER_05]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this first paper, I think that was
about a four to seven percent reduction in
[SPEAKER_05]: velvet leaf emergence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second paper found a 38 percent
reduction in lamb's quarter weed emergence
[SPEAKER_05]: over two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of them could show it was related
to these weed seed predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did we sample?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are seed arenas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a Petri dish flipped upside down
with a piece of sandpaper attached to the
[SPEAKER_05]: top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very lightly spray it with some adhesive
and then sprinkle seeds on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you press that down into the soil
and make sure it's flushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's flushed with the soil level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Insects like beetles are not particularly
intelligent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's a bit of a lip on that
arena, they'll just bump into it and then
[SPEAKER_05]: go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to be very, very careful with
making sure that's at seed level or soil
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from my experiment, we just use
giant foxtail seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sampled seed predation at four
different dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: After interseeding the cover crop in all
three sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way I analyzed this was with GLM.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a quasi binomial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's zero inflated and a lot of over
dispersion, which is why we have the quasi
[SPEAKER_05]: and binomial defining a seed being eaten
as a success and a seed not being eaten as
[SPEAKER_05]: failure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we compared means with LSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had two main hypotheses here
illustrated by this graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, what we expected to see was
that as cover crop biomass increased,
[SPEAKER_05]: we would see an increase in weed seed
predation by vertebrates and
[SPEAKER_05]: invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I should go back a slide because I
forgot to explain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can see one of these has a cage
on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's to keep out anything with a spine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So seeds from this arena, we can say are
invertebrate only.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeds that were eaten on this one,
we can say are vertebrates and
[SPEAKER_05]: invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we expected predation to increase as
cover crop biomass increased.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we expected to see more predation on
open seed arenas than once.
[SPEAKER_05]: With cages on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did we see?
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's an example of a caged arena.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the proportion of seeds consumed on the
y-axis and the log transformed cover crop
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass from August gram per meter squared
on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, in fact, saw a positive
relationship, which was great,
[SPEAKER_05]: really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was what we wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in looking over at open arenas,
we saw the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is New York in our first sampling
date, proportion of seeds consumed,
[SPEAKER_05]: increase in cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to say that we found this
in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be an alternative fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, there was a lot of nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each of these, these are states,
caged arenas open.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran eight models for each of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hope was that we would find eight
positive relationships in each of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turns out the vast majority were not
significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about just looking at open versus
closed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, this is very busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we're looking at open arenas in
gray, caged arenas in white.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the three treatments that we're
looking at are the control.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this top refers to the corn density and
the bottom refers to if there was cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's no corn with cover crop,
the medium density corn with cover crop,
[SPEAKER_05]: the medium density corn without cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we found that seed predation on the
arenas that had a cage was less than the
[SPEAKER_05]: arenas that were open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because there's so much data and I
felt kind of sad, I wanted to look for
[SPEAKER_05]: broader patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: And did another model.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a mixed effects GLM.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, seed predation as a function of
site and date.
[SPEAKER_05]: The random effect was block and treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used Bonferroni to check for
differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we have our sample dates,
August, September, October, November,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the proportion of seeds consumed.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are closed arenas, so the ones with
cages.
[SPEAKER_05]: The letters show significant difference,
but only in that date.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not comparing across dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're comparing between sites at each
date.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have Maryland, New York,
and Pennsylvania is blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see that at least in New York and
Pennsylvania, it changed over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one bit I really was interested to
see was it's more pronounced in New York,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a little bit in Pennsylvania here
where there's a bit of an uptick in seed
[SPEAKER_05]: predation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been noted before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Western men had all found that when you
grow crops that are phenologically late
[SPEAKER_05]: and provide cover late into the fall,
you'll typically see the same pattern of
[SPEAKER_05]: an uptick in seed predation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, on the open arenas, it's a little
less exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It varies slightly over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did see some difference between
sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pennsylvania, for three of those,
had the greatest seed predation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we can take away from the seed
predation data is not much support for the
[SPEAKER_05]: effect of cover crop biomass on seed
predation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw more on our open arenas,
and it changes a little bit over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I just want to talk a little
bit about a fun lab experiment that we did
[SPEAKER_05]: over the course of last summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason that we know that seed
predators are weed seed predators is
[SPEAKER_05]: because people have done a lot of lab
tests to see what they like to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, this is the results of
preference using that bug that was on the
[SPEAKER_05]: slide before, Harpalus pensylvanicus,
in no choice and choice trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this means, no choice,
is that you lock the bug up in a
[SPEAKER_05]: container, and you only give it one kind
of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see if it eats that seed,
and then you can say how much of that seed
[SPEAKER_05]: it ate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can rank them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This graph below is the results of a
choice trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're using all the same seeds,
but putting all the seeds into the
[SPEAKER_05]: container at the same time, and then
seeing if the preference changes of these
[SPEAKER_05]: insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, because I think a lot about cover
crops and seed predation, when I read a
[SPEAKER_05]: paper like this, it got me thinking about
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we know that cover crops are very
often broadcast, are they eaten by these
[SPEAKER_05]: weed seed predators?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seemed very silly to me that a
beetle would look at a rag weed seed and
[SPEAKER_05]: say, hey, that's a weed, and look at a
clover seed and say, the people like that
[SPEAKER_05]: one, I'm going to eat the rag weed seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seemed kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it turns out, no one had really
investigated invertebrate seed preference
[SPEAKER_05]: of these cover crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was something that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if anyone was hanging around at
Leland last summer, probably saw me
[SPEAKER_05]: wandering around with a net and some cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I set some dry pitfall traps,
about 80 of them, up in Caldwell Field,
[SPEAKER_05]: checked them every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would usually bring in a nice haul of
bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: These would have to be separated out by
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were stored for four days in
what are affectionately called starvation
[SPEAKER_05]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a deli container that has a
moist paper towel in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had 10 bugs of the same kind in
each of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then put in cold storage, so four to
seven degrees Celsius, just the fridge up
[SPEAKER_05]: at Leland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do this to standardize how hungry
they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do it in such a way that they don't
end up eating each other is why you need
[SPEAKER_05]: the cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, after they came out of the fridge,
they were hungry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I did some tests on some seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in no particular order, these are the
seeds that I tested preference on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these three that are outlined in green,
velvet leaf, common ragweed, giant
[SPEAKER_05]: foxtail, these are three weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some literature on a few bugs
that they like to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's data that shows they like to
eat these.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are reference seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we tried to do was have a mixture
that provided different sizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the difference between cereal rye and
something like red clover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a scale, each of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a nine centimeter measurement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had size.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a mix of grasses, dicots,
and there were some legumes thrown in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it gave us a lot to work with to really
try to see if there were trends in what
[SPEAKER_05]: they like to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after they had been cooled off in the
fridge, they were tested in no choice
[SPEAKER_05]: trials and choice trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, to reiterate, in these no choice
trials, they were locked up in a Petri
[SPEAKER_05]: dish with 26 seeds of just one seed
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the choice trials, it was two
seeds each of 13 species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kept them in there for five days,
and at the end, counted the seeds to see
[SPEAKER_05]: what they liked to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the analysis, there's a lot going on
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to analyze choice and no choice
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no choice, it was the same as we saw
before with a random effect GLM,
[SPEAKER_05]: where our fixed effect was seed species,
random effect was collection date,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we used Bonferroni.
[SPEAKER_05]: So choice, we used this electivity index.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was developed in the 70s,
and Christine introduced me to this,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, what we're looking at,
WI, is calculated as the number of seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: of one species that was eaten over the
number of all the seeds that were given
[SPEAKER_05]: divided by the sum of that across all of
our trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: N refers to the number of food species we
provided, so that was 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: And EI ends up giving you a calculation
between positive and negative 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: So negative 1 means they hate the food and
they don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive 1 means they really like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everywhere in between,
you can get a value for, and then rank
[SPEAKER_05]: that EI again with Bonferroni.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at some results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are two of the bugs we looked at.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Alanomobius alardi, which are the
very tiny crickets you find up in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is Harpalus pensylvanicus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So N equals 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: For this guy, that means 11 trials each of
these seed species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for Harpalus, it was 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a total of 260.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harpalus that we monitored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see some interesting results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So things in gray are our cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: In white, those are the weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this was pretty reassuring because it
looked like that in both of these cases,
[SPEAKER_05]: the most preferred seed was a weed seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also readily consumed cover crop
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also see here, hairy vetch,
velvet leaf, very hard seeds, very large
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys don't have the equipment to
deal with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't really eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can pick out some trends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with Harpalus here, typically you like
smaller seeds and grass seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So foxtail, annual rye, pearl millet,
all pretty small grasses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And clover over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is small.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had two other species we looked at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just say, so for the cricket you
saw on the previous page and for this
[SPEAKER_05]: beetle, there have never been seed
preference trials that I could find in the
[SPEAKER_05]: literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was Grillus pensylvanicus,
which is a larger cricket.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was only six for each of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason it was only six is these
guys are really hard to catch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to catch them under a log.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes time to learn how to catch
them by hand, applying enough pressure to
[SPEAKER_05]: not squish them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beetles are a little easier because
they're so hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So up here, we see a pretty broad
preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a bigger bug, they were able
to eat the bigger seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taurostichus, this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really liked cover crop seeds,
especially pearl millet here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put everybody up at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the choice experiments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our 13 seed species and the electivity
index on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So remember, negative 1, they don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive 1 means they love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And positive numbers, so the more positive
that the electivity index is, the more
[SPEAKER_05]: they like that seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if you remember from two
slides ago, but this cricket, this was its
[SPEAKER_05]: most preferred seed in the choice
experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one reason why it's really
important to do both a choice and a no
[SPEAKER_05]: choice experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if someone locked me up in a closet for
a couple days and then gave me moldy
[SPEAKER_05]: peaches, I would eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be my most preferred
food, but I'd eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you give me a choice, I'm probably
not going to eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important that we do both of
these, and then we can look at if the
[SPEAKER_05]: choice changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, these results are a little
more unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most preferred seed there,
cover crop, cover crop, cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy still likes giant foxtail,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still feeds on cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they all readily eat them, and this is
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So until now, these bugs have been touted
as an ecosystem service and as beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would argue that based on these lab
results, and again, it's just one summer,
[SPEAKER_05]: that if you're broadcasting your cover
crop seeds, they're not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might get hit with a double whammy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they prefer cover crop seeds,
they're going to be reducing the number of
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crop seeds you have in your field,
and they're going to be taking predation
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure off of the weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're doing two things you don't want
them to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think really this hammers home the
importance of how we intercede our cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crops and that when you do drill
interceding, again, we looked at you get
[SPEAKER_05]: more seedlings that grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Establishment is better, and now you can
still get your ecosystem services and
[SPEAKER_05]: still keep those bugs as your friends if
we bury the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of research that shows
when seeds are buried, they typically
[SPEAKER_05]: don't eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is my pitch on why people should
start really adopting drill interceded
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to thank Matt and my advisors,
or my committee members, and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful people at the Ryan Lab who
helped out, and I couldn't have done any
[SPEAKER_05]: of this without them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks in Beltsville and Penn State,
Cornell Statistical Consulting Unit,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the insect collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just in general, I'd like to say thank
you to everybody here, not just for
[SPEAKER_05]: coming, but it's been really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been wonderful to be part of Cornell,
and you all set a very, very high,
[SPEAKER_05]: hard to reach bar on what is considered
good research.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't always kept up, but thank
you for being there and providing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we do have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I have that data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really figured out how to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of looking at, we had those 26
seeds, 13 species in a Petri dish,
[SPEAKER_05]: and sort of boiling down to what you count
as preference if it's the first seed they
[SPEAKER_05]: eat versus the seed they eat the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the experimental design doesn't really
lend itself so much to saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: defining preference off of what they eat
the most, or what they eat first,
[SPEAKER_05]: because there were only two seeds of each
species, and we didn't have cameras,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we couldn't really tell what exactly
they were eating first.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would expect similar results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those four species, I would expect
similar results in areas close by,
[SPEAKER_05]: because preference is typically dictated
by how strong their mouth parts are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you mean for the field stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so the results from the first year of
data, which wasn't presented, they were
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a dry year, so we could argue
that we were mimicking the drought
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a paper that came out,
2011, that looked at seed preference when
[SPEAKER_05]: the seeds were dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Versus when they were imbibed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they found was that, overall,
you'd get lower seed predation,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the preference trends would stay
pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they're wet, yeah, they might eat
a lot more giant foxtail, but giant
[SPEAKER_05]: foxtail would still be the most preferred
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any information about the weed
pressure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm looking at what's the cumulative
impact in the field studies of cover crop
[SPEAKER_03]: density versus you might have changes in
weed seed predation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to end up with different
numbers of weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if you have any?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did sample weed biomass when we did
all the cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to look at that is more of a path
analysis sort of thing, because there are
[SPEAKER_05]: so many factors that can affect the bugs
that are there and then the interplay
[SPEAKER_05]: between weeds and cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that last experiment, how you dealt
with the ratio of insects to seeds to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fact that the same size meal
takes more small seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: But typically, when you look at these lab
experiments, and certainly pictures I can
[SPEAKER_05]: show you, when seed predation happens,
it's not that they finish eating a small
[SPEAKER_05]: seed before they move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So typically, they'll just focus on sort
of the embryo area of a seed, and then
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we counted a seed consumed if the seed
coat had been broken and if that part of
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed had been eaten a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not necessarily looking at the entire
seed had been eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were they generally eating most of the
seeds in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they filling up?
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on the species that it depends
on the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say overall, you didn't
necessarily see more small seeds being
[SPEAKER_05]: consumed rather than big seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you
[SPEAKER_04]: do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so this was a parameter established
by someone who had done these feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: trials with Gorillus pensylvanicus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you count it as consumed when the seed
coat is broken and when the embryo's been
[SPEAKER_05]: eaten.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, it's sort of not
germinatable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: The corn?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are big, big hard seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because these bugs are adapted to just
living on the soil surface and eating
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever is there, these ones at least,
unless the corn had been harvested and
[SPEAKER_05]: there were a couple stray ears on the
ground, I don't think you'd see them
[SPEAKER_05]: eating anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's certainly one of the challenges
with cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, in organic agriculture,
which is where cover crops are being sold,
[SPEAKER_05]: is very useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of the management of that
understory of the corn that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe the weed suppression or the weed
density, it's not a huge difference,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's still better than having only
weeds growing under your corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of gets to the question of how
many weeds do you eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do you control?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for sure, with the early stages of
establishment with the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they're this big in three little
rows, they're not doing that much
[SPEAKER_05]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so really, I guess it would also
depend on the time of year that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: saying when it's suppressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: One quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the corn variety, did you use the
Flexeer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you explain why you used that one and
what exactly it was?
[SPEAKER_05]: So Flexeer, if conditions are good or
planting density is a little lower and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's enough energy, the corn can
produce a second or a larger ear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used that this year because the
year before, we ran a similar experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a drought year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got almost no yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just wanted to make sure that should
it be a drought again, we'd have a little
[SPEAKER_05]: more safety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Tim?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at the x-axis on that
graph, Pennsylvania didn't actually
[SPEAKER_05]: achieve stands that were as dense as in
New York and Maryland.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you looked at it, I think the
highest corn density they had was like 7.5
[SPEAKER_05]: or so plants per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it hadn't quite plateaued out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have a sense of what seed
predators maybe go after which seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we know something about what is
around the margins of the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: could you imagine a system where maybe you
could design it so that depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're going to do cover crops or
not or what cover crops, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pull in the right predators, the optimal
predators so that you have ones that eat
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The correct weeds?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say what might be a little more my
skills to be able to do would,
[SPEAKER_05]: based on preference trials like that,
finding the least palatable seeds to the
[SPEAKER_05]: most number of seed predators and then
using that in your cover crop mixture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you know all these seeds don't get
eaten, even if you broadcast, then the
[SPEAKER_05]: predation pressure should still be on the
weeds, I hope.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's thank Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
