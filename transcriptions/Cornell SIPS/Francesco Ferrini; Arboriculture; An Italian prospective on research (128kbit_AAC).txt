[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Don and Nina,
for the very nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a bit sorry for my rusty English,
but if you complain about my English,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's that because I learned my English
here in Ithaca, so that's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I came here, Nina didn't say
that, but when I came here, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: almost any English.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned something, keep on studying,
keep on talking, and then I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I practiced it for a long time,
but now it's a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: rusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I hope you will understand
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Nina to give a seminar to tell you
about the Aborigate and urban forest
[SPEAKER_02]: research in Italy, especially the research
that my group is carrying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to give you an overview
of the research funds all over Europe and
[SPEAKER_02]: in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nina has just introduced me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach Aborigate and urban forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ornamental, aboriculture, green areas,
planting, and management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then methodologies and tools to
mitigate climate change effects in the
[SPEAKER_02]: urban environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, being the dean, so it's a quite hard
time for me to deal with all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the board of directors of the
ISA for several years, and these are my
[SPEAKER_02]: research interests, but you will see some
example of our research in the last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: First part, I would like to give you an
introduction of the School of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: of the University of Florence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very old one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dates back to the late 1700s,
and my office is actually here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the office of the Grand Duke of
Tuscany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very nice office with a lot of
frescoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's frescoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means it's very cold in winter and very
hot in summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the Grand Duke had some systems to,
you know, to adjust the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it's very cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's located in the main park of
Florence, about 80 hectares.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about 160 acres, maybe 200 acres,
something like that, full of very old
[SPEAKER_02]: trees, pine trees, oak, elm, tedia,
plane tree, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm currently the dean of the school,
the School of Agriculture of the
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Florence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's formed by two main departments.
[SPEAKER_02]: My department, the Department of Agri-Food
Production and Environmental Sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the Department of Agriculture,
Food and Forestry Systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: My department is mainly focused on
agriculture, chemistry, plant physiology,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is mainly related to
forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a third department,
which is the Department of Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of chemistry teachers in our
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we take them directly from the
Department of Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: At present, we are 27 full professor,
52 associate professor, and 38 researcher,
[SPEAKER_02]: total 117 faculty position in the school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is just the main building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have several different buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is much more modern actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seven bachelor degree courses,
which for us is three years, not four
[SPEAKER_02]: years like yours, agricultural sciences,
forestry and environmental sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery crop sciences, food sciences and
technology, wildlife sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of wildlife in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have viticulture and technology,
very important for our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: We produce probably the best wines in the
world together with French people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't like to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a new course from this
year about wood technology, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: another important topic for my country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have six master degree courses,
two years, science and agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, tropical rural development,
which is in English.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dedicated to people who come from
Africa, South America, Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_02]: countries which are known for their
tropical, subtropical or equatorial
[SPEAKER_02]: climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have science and technology of
forestry system, food technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: science and management of wildlife,
environmental resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a new one starting this year,
biotechnology for environment management
[SPEAKER_02]: and sustainable agriculture, which is
mostly in English, meaning that we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: few classes in Italian with slides in
English.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the classes are taught in
English.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had two PhD programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: First one, I'm involved in agriculture and
environmental sciences and the second
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable management of agriculture
resources, forestry and food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two main facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is located in the Chianti area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very old farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dated back to the 12th century.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's located in one of the most beautiful
places of our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we produce mainly wine and olive
oil, some cereals, some fruit trees,
[SPEAKER_02]: but mainly wine and olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look very modern, but it has
also a very high importance in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have another facilities up in
the mountains for forestry studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: still very old, dating back to the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we can host up to, I guess,
40 students at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can sleep there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can eat air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the facilities and they have
lots of forests around to study forestry
[SPEAKER_02]: and wood technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second part is dedicated to an
Italian perspective on research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say actually an European
perspective on research because most of
[SPEAKER_02]: our research money now comes from Europe,
from the European Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have chosen a top-down approach,
starting from the highest level of funding
[SPEAKER_02]: to the lowest level of funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean in terms of money there is
a difference, but in terms of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the overall structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the money, the real money now
comes from the program Horizon 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you are familiar with this
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a program that it's inside the EU
framework and it's a program from research
[SPEAKER_02]: and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started in 2014 and it will finish in
2020, but the research will finish,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all the course will be until
2020, but research will finish in 2023,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on which kind of program you
apply for.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, this is an example of a
research project which was funded by
[SPEAKER_02]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about green infrastructure and urban
biodiversity for sustainable development
[SPEAKER_02]: and green economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has just finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was inside the seventh framework
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before Horizon 2020, it finished last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this huge conference in Ovieta
about this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all the cities which were
involved in, I don't know if you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: the pointer, all of Europe and two in
Italy, Milan and Bari, were involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: this huge program which produced a lot of
publication and the book which is called
[SPEAKER_02]: The Urban Forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there is another program,
the Life Plus program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't fund research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does fund projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, just to give you a short
example, you want to, if I'm in Florence,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to change the layout of a parking
lot, a huge parking lot, transforming it
[SPEAKER_02]: from the old-fashioned parking lot with,
you know, impermeable pavement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to transform in a very sustainable
parking lot so I can ask for money to the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to present a project, but it
doesn't fund research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the word research shouldn't be
mentioned in the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do research, but nobody should
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it started in 2014,
like Horizon 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we applied to Life last
September, October, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This called Life Climate Change Adaptation
and we submitted this project,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the innovative technology
platform to improve management of green
[SPEAKER_02]: areas for better climate adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks God, three weeks ago,
we got to know from European Union that
[SPEAKER_02]: this project was funded with, two million
euros something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally got 220,000 euro for
three years, which is a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: money compared to usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to monitor plants and,
you know, any kind of stuff for three
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it was very good to get that
news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Until probably 10 years ago, it was very
hard to have from European Union a project
[SPEAKER_02]: about aboriculture and urban forestry,
landscape planning and so on, funded by
[SPEAKER_02]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: But things changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the European Union is very
sensitive to fund also this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this green infrastructure
program and they also have this
[SPEAKER_02]: nature-based solution every nature in
cities program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can apply for two calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two calls every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is in February.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is early September or the
end of September, it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can apply for these two different
calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the percentage of projects
funded is less than 10%, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of calls, a lot of
long, say, seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two calls per year, 14 calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to apply, apply, apply,
apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then probably you will get some funds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third system to get some funds,
not for research, but for networking,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the cost action.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's European cooperation in science and
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost is an acronym.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably one of the longest
running framework supporting cooperation
[SPEAKER_02]: among scientists and institution
researchers across Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now also researchers from outside of
Europe can participate with this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cooperation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't fund research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does fund exchange between researchers
and it does fund scientific mission,
[SPEAKER_02]: short term scientific mission for young
researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very good for young people who
want to have their career in the
[SPEAKER_02]: aboriculture and urban forestry sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, this cost action,
the name, the title of the cost action was
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Infrastructure Approach,
Linking Environmental with Social Aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: in Studying and Managing Urban Forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that all Europe was involved,
except for some countries, but also some
[SPEAKER_02]: part of Africa, Tunisia, and Algeria,
I guess, I don't remember, maybe Algeria.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry, Morocco, Morocco and Algeria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also United States and Canada,
because also countries from outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe can participate as a partner in
this kind of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Francesco, the previous granting
opportunity that you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that also open to North American
partners?
[SPEAKER_02]: As a partner, you can't get money but we
can get money to invite people from
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of Europe to join the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get research money but you can
get funds to come to Europe to give
[SPEAKER_02]: seminars, to exchange opinion and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this cost action, there were four
working groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: First one was Environmental Services of
Green Infrastructure and Urban Forestry
[SPEAKER_02]: and Implications of Climate Change.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one was related to Social and
Cultural Services of Green Infrastructure
[SPEAKER_02]: and Urban Forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third one, Governance and the fourth one
is Task Force on Integration and
[SPEAKER_02]: Dissemination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have some working groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not funded, it's just a system
to networking with people all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very interesting that the Food
and Agriculture Organization now has a
[SPEAKER_02]: strong interest for the urban forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year they developed that poster of
flyers in I don't know how many languages
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can download the poster on your
left from the FAO website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also produced the guidelines on
urban and peri-urban forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though FAO is mainly dedicated to
food and agriculture, now they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: special section on urban and peri-urban
forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a working group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of this working group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet at least twice a year all over
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last meeting was in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one will be in Rome at the end of
April, if I will remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have also a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be part, a member of this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get email, you can get link,
update about Congress, conference,
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the world, and you can refer to
those two persons who belong to the FAO in
[SPEAKER_02]: Rome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both Italian, but they speak a
very good English, much better than me
[SPEAKER_02]: also because they have half English both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their parents are part Italian,
part I think English, not American.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, okay, I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have a national level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you are familiar with this
project in Milan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the vertical wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became probably the most known
landscape project all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're building skyscraper with
vertical woods all over the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, France, the Netherlands,
China, South America, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's called vertical wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a wood anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's not anyway, but they grow tree
up to the 30th story in this building,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is very nice to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much is sustainable,
but it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the national level, three years
ago, we got some funds from the state for
[SPEAKER_02]: this program, Tree City, for Tree City
International Project for a Better Quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of Life in our cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It involved cities from universities from
all over Italy, from Sicily, from Rome,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Tuscany, from the northeast part of
Italy, from Milan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's finished last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another project funded by the Minister of
Agriculture and Forests, not by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Minister of University, is about the role
of urban greening on air pollution
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just finished, also this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another project we have finished
two years ago was this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We developed a software for evaluating the
effects of species selection and planning
[SPEAKER_02]: on microclimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the software is ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's working, but the ministry hasn't
released the permission to put it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are still waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third part is research of my
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going down, down, down, we finally
arrived at my department.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the building is very ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this picture was, I think,
15 years ago, maybe 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these trees are much bigger now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a turkey oak.
[SPEAKER_02]: The building is ugly, but it's very close
to Florence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Florentine, so I'm not the right
person to say something about my city.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that my city is one of the
targets for tourists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I go in Florence, Monday
morning at 7, Tuesday afternoon,
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday morning, lunchtime, always full
of tourists.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot even walk sometimes along the
street of Florence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, coming back to research,
we have some research projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will show you something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have international connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some university courses we are
managing, land, nursery, science,
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, and green areas management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have landscape architecture
together with the architecture department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I should manage these research
labs for plant nursery, science,
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, and green areas management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should because being the dean is quite
hard for me to do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a person who is actually
managing this research lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have basic research.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we are studying response
mechanism to multiple environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors in Mediterranean woody species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are just looking at the effects on
secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on the evaluation of
morphological, physiological, and
[SPEAKER_02]: biochemical properties and parameters
related to drought tolerance, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: big issue in the Mediterranean basin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's becoming bigger and bigger and
bigger year by year because of climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're working on urban trees and
volatile organic compounds emission of
[SPEAKER_02]: some species typical of our urban
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have applied research or basic
field research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will refer mainly to these research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing now pruning of ornamental
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have finished the root pruning project
to simulate street works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on the project we finished
in 2021 about the effects of different
[SPEAKER_02]: paving materials on growth, performance,
and physiology of two widely grown species
[SPEAKER_02]: in Europe and in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are studying the evaluation of
the ability of some shrub species to
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigate the effect of pollution in the
urban and peri-urban environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our philosophy is simple research,
but very deep investigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start from the field, from
morphological characters, physiological
[SPEAKER_02]: characters, parameters, and then we go to
the lab and we have all the analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: possible in our lab and in other labs
which are connected to my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: First research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to simulate the effect of street
works on two different species which are
[SPEAKER_02]: known to be different in terms of reaction
to this kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we cut the roots on one side,
both sides, and no cutting to compare the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of this stress on tree physiology
and tree growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially we wanted to calculate also the
consequences of root severance on both
[SPEAKER_02]: theoretical meaning calculated and
measured by pulling tests resistant to
[SPEAKER_02]: uprooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did this research on horse chestnut and
on linden, European linden tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 48 plants for each species which
were planted in 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we allow them to grow under sterile
force for five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2009, we cut the roots on one
side, both sides, and no cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were the three thesis,
control, trenching on one side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tree, mild drought or mild, sorry,
mild stress, and trenching on both sides
[SPEAKER_02]: of the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we excavate a trench which was 70
centimeter deep and about 50 centimeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two feet and 1.5 feet large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we measure shoot growth, stem diameter
growth, and tree height and canopy sites
[SPEAKER_02]: for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also measure the physiology,
leaf gas exchange, maximal quantum yield
[SPEAKER_02]: of photosystem 2 photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we measure pre-dome water
potential for three years between three
[SPEAKER_02]: and five AM, so very early in the morning,
night in the wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results, results show that even after
four years, as you can see here,
[SPEAKER_02]: trees hadn't recovered from the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Control had much higher growth compared to
the single trench excavation and double
[SPEAKER_02]: trenches excavation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also effect of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tilia, as expected to be, was less
sensitive compared to horse chestnut,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is known to be very sensitive to
this kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see here, the shoot growth even after
three years is in histogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a difference in terms of shoot
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in horse chestnut, there was also a
difference between the two kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: excavation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the take-home message from
this research?
[SPEAKER_02]: From a physiological point of view,
as is written there, root severance on
[SPEAKER_02]: young trees induce similar effects as a
mild water stress characterized by
[SPEAKER_02]: diffusive limitation to photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recovery is quite slow, at least three
years from the cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And linden was harder than horse chestnut,
was more resistant, more tolerant,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, more tolerant to this stress
compared to horse chestnut as it was
[SPEAKER_02]: expected to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question was, with severe trees
stand up, we had a problem of strong wind
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last year in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some tornadoes, which was a word
which was associated to the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: or to other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have tornadoes also in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to know if this kind of
stress could affect the tree resistant to
[SPEAKER_02]: uprooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we pulled the trees right after the
stress, and then we pulled the trees four
[SPEAKER_02]: years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that even four years
later, there were differences between the
[SPEAKER_02]: trees which undergrew the gun,
which were cut, which roots, sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: were cut, and the control trees,
both in linden and in horse chestnut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after four years, trees had not
recovered from the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the conclusion is that this kind of cut
induces a chronic mild water stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recovery is very slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And root damage may be a predisposing
factor for trees to be attacked by other
[SPEAKER_02]: parasites, both animals like insects and
fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the uprooting resistance was
reduced by excavation as it was expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did not expect is that this
stress was prolonged for at least four
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, almost 10 years, 10 growing
season from the cut, we will measure again
[SPEAKER_02]: the uprooting resistance of the trees by
pulling test.
[SPEAKER_02]: The limitation of this study is mainly due
to the fact that trees were quite young.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can react much faster than
probably an old tree like this plain tree
[SPEAKER_02]: in Milan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see when the tree will be older,
we'll repeat again, the root cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second experiment I would like to refer to
is about the effort of different pavements
[SPEAKER_02]: on growth and physiology of two shade
trees, a European huckberry and fruxinus
[SPEAKER_02]: ornus, which is ash, European ash,
Mediterranean ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a 10 year study evaluating the
effects of soil sitting on newly planted
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had four different phases,
24 plots, about 50 square meters in
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: We realized the research field in November
2011 and we planted the trees in spring
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four different paving material,
actually three, impervious design,
[SPEAKER_02]: asphalt on a concrete subgrade,
permeable design, curb on a crushed rock
[SPEAKER_02]: subgrade, and then porous design,
epoxy resin plus even graded inert on a
[SPEAKER_02]: crushed rock subgrade and then a
controlled no soil covering at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two species, European huckberry and manna
ash, European or Mediterranean ash,
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 plants per species.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see when we planted the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since 2012, we measure soil moisture,
soil temperature, soil oxygen content,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil CO2 efflux.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measure shoot growth, DBH, leaf gas
exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then pre-dome and midday water
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also measure all the meteorological
variables like temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on, because probably they are
affected by the different kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: We left some holes in the ground to put
our sensors for soil humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil respiration, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Results.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not the final results,
because as I said, this research will go
[SPEAKER_02]: on until 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil temperature was always higher in the
permeable treatment, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray bar is the impermeable treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature was always higher,
even in wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, even in wintertime, the temperature
of the soil was higher underneath the
[SPEAKER_02]: impermeable layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here, maybe this picture
is much better than any kind of data,
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of tables or histogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see during the snowfall, the plot with
asphalt was warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the snow at the very beginning didn't
stuck on this plot while the control delay
[SPEAKER_02]: was already a couple of centimeters,
probably one centimeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take home message.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the difference among pavement
types with no trees, meaning in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plots where the roots system
probably hasn't arrived yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the impervious pavement infiltration is
very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The evaporation is very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water content is slightly below field
capacity, and the water content at 45
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeter depth is slightly above field
capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Permeable, porous, and control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that control, the infiltration is
high, the evaporation is high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water content at 20 centimeter is 40%
of the available water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at 45 centimeters at or slightly below
field capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that in these three years of
measurement, the rainfall was quite heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of rain in the first three
years from planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So conclusion, soil setting induced a 3.3
to 5 warming in the soil, 5 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius warming the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this effect is likely due to the
impaired evaporation and can mitigate it
[SPEAKER_02]: using porous or permeable pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had soil moisture increasing with soil
sealing, and we found that the water in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil was above field capacity in soils
not planted with trees in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 accumulates below impervious
pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we found that oxygen slightly
declines below impervious pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was quite obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the effect on trees, we found that
especially Celsius was not affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: different kind of pavement, while
Pharaxinus showed some kind of mild
[SPEAKER_02]: stress, especially with the two kind of
pavement, impervious and permeable,
[SPEAKER_02]: while porous was pretty similar to
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shoot growth, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Celsius and this is Pharaxinus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the conclusion that the planting
trees in paved soils is essential for us
[SPEAKER_02]: to maintain evapotranspiration in urban
areas because we need it to cool the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pavements, at least in this case,
had limited effects on growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology of newly planted trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm referring to the first three
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now a piece ahead and we are going
to show probably new results in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius is much more tolerant compared to
ash, to manna ash, this kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we have limitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees are very young, so we don't know
what will happen in the long term with the
[SPEAKER_02]: impermeable pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, this research, thanks to the
Tree Fund, will go on until 2021,
[SPEAKER_02]: so probably the results will be much
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have published a paper in the
Environmental Research about the first
[SPEAKER_02]: four years study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was surprised to see that some kind
of pretty similar study was published
[SPEAKER_02]: recently in the International Journal of
Biometeorology, but they just measured the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf benefits instead of measuring all
these parameters we have measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just surprised to see this paper
published with just one parameter,
[SPEAKER_02]: visual parameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an impacted journal, it's 2.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Impact factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to thank the Tree Fund because
they gave us $100,000 to do this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started in 2012, as I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plot was established thanks to the
local government, but then we got this
[SPEAKER_02]: funds to go on with research until 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll check all these kind of
parameters to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also use ground penetrating radar,
geoelectrics, seismic waves, air space to
[SPEAKER_02]: check how the root system is distributed
underneath the pavements.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third and the last, we started last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topping is our fashion in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fight every single day against topping,
but my fight is useless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not succeeding in anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this is not topping, this is
butchering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not topping, you see?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tisco, are you distinguishing between
topping and pollarding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollarding is something that is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's well done, topping is always bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of work is very common in
Italy, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's very bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why people talk trees?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always try to explain that topping is
dangerous, it's useless, it's much more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive than regular pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It arms trees and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No success.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep on topping, keep on topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes because they don't want to have
leaves in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say you still have leaves even if
you top trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you have more leaves in a few years,
but anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we know about pruning?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what don't we know?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of information, tech
information, but it seems to be a battle
[SPEAKER_02]: against windmills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say this like, you know, Sancho Panza
in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even though we have a lot of
information, people keep on telling,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep on asking the municipality to top
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the idea, why don't we try to
show the effect of topping trees on
[SPEAKER_02]: microclimate conditions and show the
people how the microclimate condition can
[SPEAKER_02]: be changed if you top trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we top trees last year in February.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have, you know, all these plots,
normal pruning, topping, normal pruning
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on, on two species, linden and
mountain maple, A.
[SPEAKER_02]: pseudoplananus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the first year we saw some
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the orange bar are the topped
plots and the green bar are the unpruned
[SPEAKER_02]: plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that the temperature was always
higher, three to five centigrade higher in
[SPEAKER_02]: the top plots compared to the unpruned
plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three degrees centigrade on average,
but in some days the difference was nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: eight to nine degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we have a lone plots just beside the
experimental plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also measure the temperature and the
humidity and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in that problem you see that there
was no difference between topped and lone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also phenology was affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees lost their leaves before when they
were topped compared to the unpruned
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have, I'm going to finish,
recent lines of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are studying the respose mechanism of
trees, species of oak, to drop heat stress
[SPEAKER_02]: according to climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I said before, she's not there
now, we are studying the secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism in Mediterranean evergreen
species with high tolerance to osmotic
[SPEAKER_02]: stress to explore the role of these
species as a biofactories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when they are stressed,
they produce a lot of antioxidants,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are good also for our health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in using the mild stress on these
species can be very good to extract these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds from these species and to use
these compounds in the oncology and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still doing research about the air
pollution abatement by roadside vegetation
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier, working on shrubs, evergreen
shrubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are studying the isoprenoids and
phenylpropanoids and their role in the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought stress resistance in London plane
tree and in European huckberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the last research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to understand which are the
mechanisms in red and green leaf tree
[SPEAKER_02]: species because it seems that having red
species means also to have much more
[SPEAKER_02]: antioxidants in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems that red leaf species can
tolerate drought and light stress much
[SPEAKER_02]: more than green leaf species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an hypothesis we are studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that our hypothesis is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we work on Norway maple, sorry,
Norway maple, red Norway maple,
[SPEAKER_02]: Deborah, which is half red, half green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think it's summer shade,
just green.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have published more than 50 papers in
impacted journals out of this and previous
[SPEAKER_02]: research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to finish some information,
if you are interested in aboricage and
[SPEAKER_02]: urban forestry, there will be the World
Forum of Urban Forestry in Mantua,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in the north of Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Late November, 28th of November,
1st of December, Mantua is a very nice
[SPEAKER_02]: city in the middle of the flatland part of
Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very historic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a nice lake just close to the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Congress is the forum, sorry,
it's organized by the FAO together with
[SPEAKER_02]: International Federation of Landscape
Architects, the Polytechnic on Milan,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the scientific board and there's a
call for abstract which will, the deadline
[SPEAKER_02]: is 30th of April, if I will remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all the objectives of the
World Forum of Urban Forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any kind of research about aboricage
and urban forestry is welcome to this
[SPEAKER_02]: forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the venue and this is the website
if you are interested in enjoying the
[SPEAKER_02]: forum at late November, early December.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to finish, last year we published
this Routledge handbook of urban forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually Nina has two chapters,
right, in the book and it probably covers
[SPEAKER_02]: all the topics in the urban forestry and
all, any single chapter is written by the
[SPEAKER_02]: most prominent researchers all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find everything, everything in
this handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit expensive but I think there is,
you know, it's, it worth the money it
[SPEAKER_02]: costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's all folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some question I'll be happy to
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even question from Geneva, I forgot to say
hello to people from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: One small question, thank you so much by
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your presentation available online or
by email?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will leave my presentation, so I think
it will be online soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need more details on the research
because you know, time is sometimes is
[SPEAKER_02]: short and I gave a presentation last year
was six hours of all the research,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I just put some slides to give an
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, if you want to know more,
you can write to me, my address,
[SPEAKER_02]: email address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be very happy to share information,
research and papers with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your experiment with how trees are
bonded to different kinds of pavement,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of soil did you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was native soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a loamy, sandy loamy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's local soil with some skeleton
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was normal soil with a high pH
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 7.8 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you compact the soil under that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what level?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the level for street pavement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we followed the load.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 1.6 maybe more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How frequent is topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, everywhere, anywhere, anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning I fought with my mayor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't live in Florence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live just outside of Florence and my
mayor, I know him very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can call me anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: But last week they chopped some trees and
I got very angry, very angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go to, I have a Facebook page,
which is called Morikachi and Urban
[SPEAKER_02]: Forestry by Francesco Ferringo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't believe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't believe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How people butcher trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is the difference between
pruning and cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can cut the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot prune a tree because I need some
skills and also some knowledge to prune
[SPEAKER_02]: the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutting and pruning are two different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have time for just one more
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, if you have questions,
just write to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be very happy to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing is much easier than talking for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your objective of coming here
to have a connection?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my targets as a dean when I was
elected, there was a strong competition,
[SPEAKER_02]: just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told me, they asked me,
would you like to be the dean of this
[SPEAKER_02]: school?
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, well, if there is any other person
who want to be, I mean the public servant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's my duty to be the dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in California, I got the news I
was elected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, one of the target I put on my
list was to have to establish closer
[SPEAKER_02]: connection with university all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This means a lot of travel anywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: United States is the nicest country,
but I had traveled to Iran, to
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan, to Azerbaijan, to Jordan,
to Korea and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anywhere in the world to establish
closer connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closer connection to exchange students and
also researchers and professors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an agreement, it's much
easier for some of us to come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some of you, also the students to
come to Italy to spend a certain period of
[SPEAKER_02]: the times doing research or attending
classes or whatever you want to do in
[SPEAKER_02]: Italy, enjoying life maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Saturdays and Sundays, not on the
weekdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to have a formal agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we were talking about to have a
double degree, which will not be very
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can do it, but it takes time to
have a double degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students from landscape architecture or
from horticulture department can spend
[SPEAKER_02]: here two years, maybe six months in Italy
taking classes and taking also exams and
[SPEAKER_02]: also the vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students from Italy can come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main problem is the different
taxation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the two universities agree to not to
put any more taxes on these students,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, the taxes is very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the opposite, which is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I think that we can adjust
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, landscape architecture,
students can come to Italy to spend six
[SPEAKER_02]: months or maybe a year if they are
interested, especially in historical
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape management and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our courses specialize in historical
management, historical landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: management, which is quite obvious in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for coming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
