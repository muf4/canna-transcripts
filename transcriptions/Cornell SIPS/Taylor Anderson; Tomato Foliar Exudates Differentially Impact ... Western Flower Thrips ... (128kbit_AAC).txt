[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year I'm going to be talking a
little bit more about my efforts to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for disease resistance in northeast
adapted tomato, but today I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about something a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking about an
experiment that I did to evaluate some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our insect resistant tomato lines against
this guy right here, the western flower
[SPEAKER_00]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the western flower trip causes damage
to tomato both directly and indirectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and directly it's done by sucking out cell
contents and by inserting eggs into the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis of the leaf and stem tissue,
and that's called oval position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also causes indirect damage by
transmitting viruses such as the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: spotted wilt virus seen there,
and traditionally that system is managed
[SPEAKER_00]: by insecticides, but there could be an
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acyl sugars are foliar secondary
metabolites, they're insect resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, and they're accumulated in
particularly high quantities by wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the Solanaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see some type 4 trichomes with
droplets full of acyl sugars, and the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar phenotype of a plant is defined by
two primary parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is the aggregate amount
of all of the different types of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, and the second is the chemotype,
or the different structures or chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: components that make up the acyl sugars,
and the chemotype can be quite diverse in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a monosaccharide or a
disaccharide sugar base, there can be
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four attached fatty acids,
and those fatty acids can be attached in
[SPEAKER_00]: different spatial orientations,
they can be of different weights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can be branched differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily for me, Martha and John had
recently created a number of inbred tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that varied both the amount and
chemotype in tomato, which allowed me to
[SPEAKER_00]: test a few hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to know, do foliar acyl sugars
impact thrips oval position rates and
[SPEAKER_00]: Tospovirus inoculation rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, is there variation for that insect
resistance phenotype, just as there's
[SPEAKER_00]: variation for the acyl sugar plant
phenotype, and can some of that variation
[SPEAKER_00]: be attributed to either the amount of acyl
sugar or the chemotype of the acyl sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: or some combination of both?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, I did an insect choice
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a Western flower thrip was exposed to
two leaf discs, and these leaf discs were
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same leaf, from the same plant,
treated identically in every way,
[SPEAKER_00]: except that one was washed with water,
and that temporarily removes the foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates by about 75%, allowing me to test
presence, absence of acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a separate dimension, looking at
differences among genotypes, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Celebrity and M82, which were included in
the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are commercial tomato controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They accumulate only trace acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have C071026, which is our acyl sugar
benchmark breeding line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It accumulates about 15% the level of acyl
sugar of Solana pinellii, LA716.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have lines that have acyl sugar
level QTL that modify the amount of acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lines that modify the chemotype of
acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, we have a fatty acid 5
line, and this line has a chemotype
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating QTL, but it also has a
pleiotropic interaction with the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar level that causes it to have a level
that's very low, like Celebrity and M82,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives us a very powerful and closely
related control to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I am setting up the insect
galleries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two leaves, washed and unwashed,
they're set in auger so that the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: can only interact with one side of the
leaf disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 10 female Western flower thrips are
inserted into the center of the gallery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're allowed to feed and oviposit
for about 24 hours, after which point the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is stained with McBride solution,
destained with lactic acid, and then under
[SPEAKER_00]: the microscope I can count the eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one and two in this leaf disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that the probability
that a western flower thrip oviposites
[SPEAKER_00]: into the washed leaf disc, which is
reduced in acyl sugar, as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: probability that it oviposites into the
unwashed acyl sugar intact leaf disc is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different for every single
line in my experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it shows the effect of removal of
foliar exudates, at least temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, the magnitude of that
difference varies across genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I'm to take this plot and just
kind of clean it up a little bit by just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the unwashed leaf discs side by
side by genotype, we see that same
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, but it's more clear to see
that some of the lines, like fatty acid 7
[SPEAKER_00]: and acyl sugar 610, did particularly well
in reducing the probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: oviposition, especially when compared to
the commercial tomato controls and our
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related breeding line,
which has low acyl sugar level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fatty acid 5 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did the same thing for Tospovirus
inoculation, except this time the thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: were infected with TSWV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did ELISA at the end to count
the incidence of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a very similar trend where,
again, fatty acid 7 and the acyl sugar 610
[SPEAKER_00]: line are among the best performing lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, you see quite a bit of
additional variation in this experiment as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is due to differences in
the number of replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also hypothesize that the amount of
inputs that go into the decision behind
[SPEAKER_00]: oviposition may be greater than for
feeding, because there are real
[SPEAKER_00]: ramifications for the survival of your
offspring in deciding where to put your
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to where to just try and feed
at a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't like that spot,
you can just move on to the next spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that maybe there might be a
connection between the difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: levity of those decisions and the
variation seen in these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that among the high acyl sugar
producing lines, there's still quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of variation in insect response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could ask the question,
well, is that variation due to the acyl
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar level or due to changes in acyl
sugar chemotherapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should remind you that these lines
here, although they have QTL that modify
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype, there's also pleiotropic
interactions between those QTL and the
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugar level or amount phenotype,
which allows us to do a logistic
[SPEAKER_00]: regression for the probability of
oviposition against the average acyl sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: level of a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that as the acyl sugar
level increases for a line, the
[SPEAKER_00]: probability that a thrip lays its egg in
the unwashed leaf, so that's the leaf with
[SPEAKER_00]: the acyl sugar, the acyl sugar in it goes
down significantly, almost to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite is true for the washed
leaf disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a very similar trend for TSWV
inoculation, where the probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection in the unwashed leaf disc drops
from about 60%, again, to about 1% to 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could also ask the question,
well, what about the chemotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of these fatty acids that
we've measured, some of which are
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated, some of which are negatively
correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're uncorrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of these have an impact in insect
damaging behaviors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, because of the
aforementioned pleiotropic interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: between the QTL, there's no way to
experimentally isolate the changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can still build a model to try and
make some educated guesses as to what
[SPEAKER_00]: might be going on in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what I've done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used minimum AIC model selection
criteria and a Bayesian statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: framework called FIRTH, bias reduced
maximum likelihood estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also used a forward stepwise
variable selection to identify my
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors from a pool of predictors that
best described over position rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pool of predictors included the
overall aggregate amount of acyl sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of acyl sucrose versus acyl
glucose, and the amount of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different individual quantitative fatty
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, interestingly,
it doesn't give you a model that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: acyl sugar level or amount, but it gives
you a model that shows two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual fatty acid predictors as most
explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a straight chain C12 molecule
and an isobranched 4-carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: For TSWV inoculation, we again find that a
fatty acid is most explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fatty acid is the straight chain
10-carbon molecule, which is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated to the 12-carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seen as the most significant variable
in the FIRST model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, these models are showing
fairly similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we learned that there are
differences among lines or insects over
[SPEAKER_00]: position and transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that in some cases,
lines do particularly well at reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence of tomato spotted wilt virus or
over position.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that some of the variation
among these lines can be attributable to
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of acyl sugar that a line has,
but we can do a better job of describing
[SPEAKER_00]: and possibly predicting the insect
response by including chemotype or the
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of particular chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use that information to guide
our breeding efforts to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: insect-resistant acyl sugar lines for the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to thank Dr. Suley
Ben-Mammoud and Dr. Diane Oman at UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my old bosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped a lot with the design and
implementation of this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Tom Chappell at Texas A
&M for independently replicating my model
[SPEAKER_00]: using SAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank the Mutchley Lab for
supporting me and for showing me how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical analysis in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions for Taylor or Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taylor, if you don't give them a choice,
will they go ahead and over deposit or
[SPEAKER_01]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't give them a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you only put in the leaf disc
with the trifoam stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a background experiment where I
gave them two leaf discs that were both
[SPEAKER_00]: unwashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were as is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were of tomato, so they don't
produce a whole lot of acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, the split was 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 for over position.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did over deposit into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on a celebrity variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on celebrity, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about if you use two of your acyl
sugar lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just more testing for aggregation
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one was saying, hey, come over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was basically an effect for
one of the leaves spatially as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the acyl sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't test that specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the fact that it can be washed up
with water imply that rain just completely
[SPEAKER_02]: wipes out the ability for them to resist?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knocks it off by about 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the acyl sugars come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, actually,
something that you can't see in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a binary random variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have two binary random variables
where both leaves can be infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: both uninfected, or one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, actually, that the difference
is that they trend together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this means to me is we
actually let them feed for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let them feed for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it looks like is, for a period of
time, the washed leaves were more
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the acyl sugars came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see that trend again with
acyl sugar level, which if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: completely removed permanently,
you wouldn't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just be a flop line on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the water applied?
[SPEAKER_02]: A gentle sprinkle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with an algin bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tip was cut off, so it was wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why was that done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why was that done?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got just a little sprinkle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because you have to be fairly vigorous
to knock the acyl sugars off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, a rain, unless you're talking
about a tropical storm, is not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: removing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's thank tower then.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
