[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to start this talk out
differently than ever before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who in this room likes landscape
paintings?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't like landscape paintings?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was somebody who didn't love landscape
paintings.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have turned around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll see why I'm talking about this
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, my work is all about biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Hudson River School of Art was in
the mid-1800s.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were American painters, whatever that
meant to be an American in 1800.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were landscape painters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the school was sort of along the
Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also went out west.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some famous names are Thomas Cole,
Friedrich Church, Albert Briefstadt,
[SPEAKER_05]: Asher Durland, and Georgina.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think of this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the feeling in this image?
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic.
God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grandeur.
[SPEAKER_05]: Immense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the feeling in this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Foreboding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ominous.
Oxidation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should do this more often.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on in this one?
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the first to say that the first
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Impending doom.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also this little umbrella that's
forming and a little top hat down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on in this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Windy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a battle.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they wearing, those people in
battle?
[SPEAKER_05]: Red coats.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this one feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Peaceful, bucolic.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That comes later.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this one feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Expansive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prospecting maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some civilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this one feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Settled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does that settling feel compared
to this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is industrialization, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's running on coal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trees are cut off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just bucolic landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the beginning of a city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on the Hudson.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industrial action of the fisheries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Hudson River School of Arts reflect
on three themes of America in the 19th
[SPEAKER_05]: century.
[SPEAKER_05]: Discovery, exploration, and settlement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it covers these ranges of experiences
of you come here and this diabolical fear
[SPEAKER_05]: of nature, this heavenly admiration of
nature, the coexistence with nature,
[SPEAKER_05]: the utility of nature, and the mastery of
nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since my talk is about biomass,
I'm fundamentally talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: mastery of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want us all to remember that all
these other experiences of New York I
[SPEAKER_05]: showed you in these images, you could
think of them as just fantastical
[SPEAKER_05]: paintings, but they are actually documents
of other ways of being on this same
[SPEAKER_05]: landscape, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are making real choices here as
environmental scientists about structuring
[SPEAKER_05]: the next generation of what our landscape
looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because certainly New York City,
where I live, doesn't look like any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: images I have just showed you,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Horizontal line.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the first thing I do for the
first hour on the bus when I'm coming
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm looking for is the horizontal
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't happen in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why it's happening,
right, is we're at such a huge population.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was born in 1973, there were like
half as many people as there are now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the same land mass,
but we have twice as many people as when I
[SPEAKER_05]: was born.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those paintings I just showed you were
when we had between one and two billion
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the whole earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you came to the New World,
when you came to America back then,
[SPEAKER_05]: there were some real ethical questions
about what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was so beautiful, but then
there were all these resources that you
[SPEAKER_05]: could utilize.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was a battle between becoming
wealthy, whatever that means, and keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: it pristine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's now the formal part of the talk,
but I wanted to frame it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do we manage our landscape for
food, feed, fiber, and fuel in this
country?
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes back to my early work with John
Duxbury and what I'm continuing to do work
[SPEAKER_05]: with Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, I'm going to focus on
the fuel component.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple years ago with Peter and many
other people, we did an analysis of the
[SPEAKER_05]: New York State biomass feedstock
production, sustainable feedstock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was based on land availability,
land suitability, and biomass yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we applied all these different
constraints.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go over them,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forests will stay as forests, protected
lands, meaning state and federal,
[SPEAKER_05]: are not used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Existing wood products were maintained,
dead, and 35% of tops were left in the
[SPEAKER_05]: forest for biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't consider equine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all landowners are going to want to
grow biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So only 50% adopt or roughly, you know,
herbaceous will remain herbaceous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had all of these factors that
we put into this in order to get this
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass feedstock number that could be
sustainably produced in New York State.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's that graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: In sum, it's 14.2 teragrams of biomass for
bioenergy per year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our existing production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's roughly the same amount and this is
what we think we could sustainably produce
[SPEAKER_05]: in 2020, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, you know, if this is what
we're producing in this state already and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're doubling it, it seems like kind of a
large endeavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to change certain things and
practices, but to give you some context of
[SPEAKER_05]: what 14.2 teragrams of biomass is,
this is the New York State Energy
[SPEAKER_05]: Flowchart from NYSERDA's 2015 publication,
but it's based on 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York State consumes 3,665 tera BTUs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So funny, I use the T all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have these conversions in
losses, which is basically only
[SPEAKER_05]: considering the electricity, so that our
net consumption is 2,600.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is petroleum is purple,
natural gas, coal, other fuels which has
[SPEAKER_05]: nuclear, hydro, wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are sort of proportional shapes so
you can get a sense of what's going in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this 14.2 tera grams, if we just
convert it to a BTU value, right,
[SPEAKER_05]: just as raw biomass, accounts for 7%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of this number, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of our sustainable biomass,
7% of our current energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did was instead of looking at
returns on investments, we looked at how
[SPEAKER_05]: much, how we could look at the processes
that this biomass would go through to do
[SPEAKER_05]: the most work for society, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make gallons of ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could make kilowatt hours,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are products in themselves,
but what we want to do, since we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: this finite land base with this finite
biomass on it, we want to do the most work
[SPEAKER_05]: for society.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, this whole analysis is about
fundamentally focused on the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a simple sort of input-output
analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use the basic unit of the joule.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a measure of comparing the quantity
of energy and it misses something of the
[SPEAKER_05]: quality of energy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all energies are the same when you
compare them on a joule basis,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They might have the same joules,
but you can do a lot more with electric
[SPEAKER_05]: joules than you can do with heat joules,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we looked for two types of works,
two types of work, heating for homes or
[SPEAKER_05]: buildings and transport as measured by
distance traveled in a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are the steps and the boundaries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have to plant and grow and
harvest the biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have to move the wet biomass to a
processing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have to convert the biomass to a
usable form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we move that energy product to
consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are many energy products,
right, that we could get out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cellulosic biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be ethanol pellets, grain,
electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we do one more step, which is we
convert that energy to work to think about
[SPEAKER_05]: the end use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for growing and harvesting,
just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this list is really long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go through the whole list
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just showing you three attributes of
comparing what happens with maize versus
[SPEAKER_05]: willow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to plow maize every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You plow for the grass one every 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that affects the energy for the plow
and the embodied energy in the plow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are some of the attributes that
go into looking at the energy at growing
[SPEAKER_05]: and harvesting the biomass across the
different types of biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have to look at the moisture
content of the biomass, because that
[SPEAKER_05]: affects the weight when you're
transporting it to the processing center.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at the BTU content or the
gigajoule content of that biomass to
[SPEAKER_05]: calculate our raw energy resource.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the harvest costs that I just
sort of alluded to in the last slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then distances that the biomass is
transported to a site.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that maize grain was based
on our two ethanol plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we only have two ethanol plants in the
state, so there's a farther distance that
[SPEAKER_05]: the corn has to travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in the other scenarios,
we have 24 smaller biomass plants around
[SPEAKER_05]: the state, so they have a shorter distance
to travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just giving you some of the... And
this calculates, this translates into how
[SPEAKER_05]: much of the dry biomass is spent towards
transportation energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many attributes, but I'm just
trying to give you a sense of what's going
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you get to the processing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two existing maize grain ethanol
plants, but you could also use that same
[SPEAKER_05]: maize grain for a pellet stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one existing combined heat and
power plant that uses wet wood chips in
[SPEAKER_05]: Lyonsdale, New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cellulosic ethanol, this was in
collaboration with our group for the
[SPEAKER_05]: analysis for NYSERDA, which is a next
generation cellulosic ethanol production.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you could also use that same
cellulose and make pellets, which could go
[SPEAKER_05]: into a pellet stove, or you could make
those pellets go into a combined heat and
[SPEAKER_05]: power plant just to generate electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are some of the scenarios that we
saw for this biomass, or processing
[SPEAKER_05]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you need to know about these
scenarios or these processes is that they
[SPEAKER_05]: have different numbers of steps,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more steps you do in a process,
generally you lose energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maize grain is interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's 15.5% moisture content,
you could just pop it in the stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to do anything before you
get heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all you're getting out of that product
is heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not getting electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it depends on what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some others were one step.
[SPEAKER_05]: So biomass was pelletized for a pellet
stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wet wood chips were combusted in a
real plant to generate electricity,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that plant was 22% efficient in
generating electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: The maize grain is converted to ethanol,
or the cellulose biomass was converted to
[SPEAKER_05]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, one step, and you have a product
that people can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we went one step further,
and we did two steps, where you take that
[SPEAKER_05]: pellet loaded cellulose, and you generated
electricity at 30% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you put the ethanol in to generate
electricity at a slightly higher
[SPEAKER_05]: conversion efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once you have your product,
whether it's megawatts, it has to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through the grid, and it loses 15% of its
energy through the grid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you use a truck to take it to the
distribution center i.e.
[SPEAKER_05]: gas station, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was calculated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have to look at the end use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is kind of where the crux of our
analysis comes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you'll see it later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we put maize in a 75% efficient pellet
stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cellulose pellets we put in an 80%
efficient stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ethanol in an 80% efficient home
boiler electricity is 99% efficient in
[SPEAKER_05]: generating heat in a home.
[SPEAKER_05]: For distance, we did ethanol in a 20%
efficient internal combustion engine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did distance by electricity in a
75% efficient electric car.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, there are potential
co-products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say potential, because there's
always products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not they're used and considered
products is another matter, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it waste, generally, because we
have very poor imaginations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use waste very frequently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maize ethanol makes dried distillers
grains.
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a high value for feed,
animal feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, this analysis keeps
everything on the joule level.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're comparing everything with joules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though this might have more value
in terms of producing beef or milk or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, this is just kept in terms of
joules as pellets that could go into a
[SPEAKER_05]: pellet stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cellulosic ethanol has a small amount of
electricity that's generated as a
[SPEAKER_05]: co-product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you generate electricity in a
power plant, you generate tons of heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could potentially capture that
waste heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Lionsdale biomass plant,
which runs on wet wood chips up in Lion's
[SPEAKER_05]: Fall, New York, and it's only 22%
efficient, it used to sell its waste heat
[SPEAKER_05]: to a neighboring paper plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would dry the paper at the paper
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they no longer do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the paper plant now has a natural gas
heater to dry their paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though these two companies are
close proximity, again, when energy is
[SPEAKER_05]: cheap, you don't have to cooperate,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a very real reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: The maize grain has no co-product,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just combusting it straight for
heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And same thing with the pelletized
cellulose for heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the summary table that's coming up is
based on these five characteristics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to try to go through this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is important is what I guess
I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we start out with this biomass,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a character.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got so many BTUs in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a certain moisture content,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we want to convert it,
we're going to go through some processing
[SPEAKER_05]: losses, OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to lose things in the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had to put things in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to use energy to apply nutrients to
the feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to transport it by car,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are external inputs, OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we want to do work with that biomass,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to heat our homes and we want to
travel distances.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we do that, we lose energy,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an efficient system turning
ethanol into maize driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an inefficient system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are these end use losses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are these co-products that
I just listed that could be used.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we don't use them, then they're
wastes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So these five attributes that I'm talking
about, oops, I guess it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not next.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just talk about the scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: At which we're doing these analyses
because, you know, scale matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one scenario is just green wood chips
and existing power plant of 20 megawatts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a simple conversion efficiency
of 22%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maize grain to existing power plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 54% efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I say simple conversion,
I mean you're getting all this ethanol out
[SPEAKER_05]: without thinking about any of the inputs
that went into it, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's 54% of the biomass BTU but not of
the total energy system BTU, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means you put in this much corn,
you got this much ethanol out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also put lots of other things in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just giving you these simple
conversion efficiencies to show you the
[SPEAKER_05]: range at the very first step without
considering any of the other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course, maize grain in a pellet
stove, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not talking about the energy that
went into making the maize grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 100% efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you've got the corn grain already
in the form that you want or you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: use in your pellet stove.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just sort of a summarizing
chart also of inputs and products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the biomass energy content.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the energy within the biomass that
we harvested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the supplemental energy that
we had to add to it in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the products, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we get these primary products
which is, you know, electricity,
[SPEAKER_05]: ethanol, grain, pellets, electricity,
ethanol, and electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these co-products that I was just
talking to you about before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the chart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to do it in three.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have labels because that comes
in the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to orient you to this
graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each one of these bars is a megagram or
a unit of biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's above zero, it's work that is
accomplished by society, for society,
[SPEAKER_05]: like distance traveled or homes heated.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's below zero, it means that it's
been lost somewhere in the process,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It either was lost as an input,
it was lost in the processing,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was lost in the end use efficiency,
all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And to orient you again, these are all
about transportation and these are all
[SPEAKER_05]: primarily about your primary product being
heat, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So next slide adds more information.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the processing loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're converting the maize grain
into ethanol, this is the process loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how much product you make,
okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever it's all this green, whether it's
striped or not, that's the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: product you're making.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're making ethanol,
I don't know, like 50 percent,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said 54 percent for maize grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is 54 percent of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's turned into ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you had to use this much energy
input.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sort of deducting that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though you could sell that ethanol,
you actually need it to make the next
[SPEAKER_05]: generation of ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is when you take that ethanol and you
put it in your car and you go miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's only in a 20 percent efficient
internal combustion engine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means only 5 percent of the corn
grain is going to traveling distance in
[SPEAKER_05]: miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of it is going off as waste heat
into the atmosphere or maybe heating your
[SPEAKER_05]: car in the winter, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is the co-product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't use this co-product,
it should come down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most of these scenarios, we don't
actually use the co-product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, it's dry distillers grain
and it is actually used for animal feed,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point here is that these numbers
right here, that's the proportion of the
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass that's actually doing work for
society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this up here is the co-product
that could do work for society if we're
[SPEAKER_05]: clever about it, if we're not already
using it, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So clearly, using the maize grain or the
pelletized cellulose is going to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: most direct work from the primary product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 64 or 69 percent of that biomass is
going to heat homes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, using 5 percent of it doing
transportation if it's ethanol,
[SPEAKER_05]: corn ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we pelletize the cellulose and we put
it in a combined heat and power plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: we generated electricity, 19 percent of it
could go towards driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if we would just use the waste heat,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole collective would be 60 percent
utility for society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have two products.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got heat products and transportation
products, all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We like this potentially if we would use,
right, because electricity is very
[SPEAKER_05]: versatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really powerful fuel type,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just be effective at using the
waste heat, then this would be a great
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like 62 percent of the biomass is
going to products for society,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it requires some coordination so that
that waste heat is actually used.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though this is like the bigger
number, it's a bigger number for heat
[SPEAKER_05]: products, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the value of the quality of the energy
is very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This moved down, but this is supposed to
be highlighting this line, but basically
[SPEAKER_05]: the same biomass can use 5 to 19 percent
of its photosynthetic energy to drive
[SPEAKER_05]: miles versus the same biomass can use 12
to 69 percent of its photosynthetic energy
[SPEAKER_05]: to heat homes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If the objective is to do work for
society, how do we want to move?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kinds of things do we want to support
and move forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: So to bring this home in a 25 mile per
gallon car, I think the average was 23
[SPEAKER_05]: recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant to check on that, but at an
average of $3.23, this is averaged across
[SPEAKER_05]: the last three years, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I recognize when I took my bus,
it was $1.57 in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can divide this by two and get your
number, but I don't think a dollar 57 is
[SPEAKER_05]: forever, but anyways, gas at 3.23 a
gallon, electricity at 18 cents per
[SPEAKER_05]: kilowatt hour, ethanol at $3 a gallon,
and E85 at 2.94 a gallon would cost $12.78
[SPEAKER_05]: to use gas to go 100 miles versus $6.07 to
go 100 miles in an electric vehicle,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I just reduced this by half,
$1.57.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, they're equal in terms of
the cost, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're getting it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at it at a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we took all the cellulose,
all the sustainable cellulose from New
[SPEAKER_05]: York State, and we convert it into
ethanol, and we made this many gallons of
[SPEAKER_05]: ethanol at $3 a gallon, it would cost the
consumer $4.2 billion to buy those
[SPEAKER_05]: gallons, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we pelleted all the cellulose for
electric cars, and we converted it to
[SPEAKER_05]: electricity at 18 cents per kilowatt hour,
it's $3.7 billion to the consumer,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of the same price, but you can only
drive 35 times 10 to the nine miles versus
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 times 10 to the nine miles on the same
price, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is everybody kind of getting this?
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are my modest conclusions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our biomass only accounts for 7% of
primary energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could increase efficiency on all kinds
of levels, but in this particular case,
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it makes it clear, the electric
vehicle versus the internal combustion
[SPEAKER_05]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then thinking about diversity of end
use, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're moving away from just fuels for
transportation and thinking more
[SPEAKER_05]: cohesively about the whole system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we want to deliver to society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, we have to think about seasonal
changes and be sensitive to climate
[SPEAKER_05]: changes, and how this intensifies the land
base, and what are the competing uses for
[SPEAKER_05]: this land base, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We could all go back to the collic images
of the Hudson River School.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we could get really inefficient cars
and have that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have many choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's tons of competing uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally, less conversion means
greater social benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, it depends immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more saleable product does not mean
more societal work, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this last one, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just couldn't help myself, but I'll just
move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to entertain questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For New York?
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I really like what Helen
and Sally looks, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even though it doesn't get the
maximum out of the end use in the biomass,
[SPEAKER_04]: it gives us two products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's two very important
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in a freezing cold society.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a serious necessity, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as important as food, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But electricity is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has so much capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while the easy answer is to say pellet
stoves and pellets for corn or for pellet
[SPEAKER_04]: high cellulose, I live in New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up with a wood stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no interest in necessarily going
back to a wood stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a lovely thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people aren't going to accept
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this electricity is very useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just have to be clever.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got all kinds of industries that
could use that waste heat, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we could just have smaller combined
heat and power systems all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at a firm in New York City.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I met with NYSERDA a couple of weeks
ago to figure out how you identify
[SPEAKER_06]: locations that have combined heat and
power systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that your electricity is co-generating
with heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, New York City was based on
combined heat and power back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we used coal, which made so much
particulate matter that it was actually
[SPEAKER_06]: harmful to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have other fuel choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what does it mean when you generate
your electricity and you use your waste
[SPEAKER_06]: heat?
[SPEAKER_06]: You've just reduced your impact by 50%
because you lose so much of that waste
[SPEAKER_06]: heat, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to use another energy
source to heat that same area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am very much of the mindset to
combine heat and power, not just for
[SPEAKER_04]: biomass products, but for all of our
energy products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why we can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of with the way that this is set up
with probably just biomass and expertise
[SPEAKER_01]: and energy, I was wondering if it raises
questions for me about nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning extracting nutrients from the
fields or the forest areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in our analysis that we did at the very
beginning of this presentation for
[SPEAKER_04]: NYSERDA, we do replacement nutrients for
the systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: What that means, though, at the consumer
end, like what happens to the nutrients in
[SPEAKER_05]: the combined heat and power plant ash or
in the pellet stove ash, that is not
[SPEAKER_05]: incorporated in this analysis,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not fully cycling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just getting nutrients from another
source to maintain the quality of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question about this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a simple question.
[SPEAKER_10]: The fourth one to the right has some
biofibre or a cobalt.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these co-products up here could
easily be added down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the green is what actually is a product
that we're using in society.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a product we're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the cellulosic ethanol,
it makes electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: That most definitely is getting used.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the product we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Specifically on the peas, there are some
like the ones 17 and 26.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is waste heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Waste heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in these two scenarios, so the woodship
plant, it used to use the waste heat to
[SPEAKER_04]: dry the paper of an eight-room paper
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this scenario, so this is based off
of a combined heat and power pellet plant
[SPEAKER_07]: that is done in Ashokokan, Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't use the waste heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's an industrial site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could be used.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Jenny, I think maybe what you're
getting at is what's the difference
[SPEAKER_11]: between the primary and secondary product
for that case?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it says heat up top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the transportation is the green part
right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation is the green part here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then heat is the green part here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these are co-products which are
variable according to.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, the dry distilled strands
are used.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, electricity is used.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, it would be waste heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for the one he picked out,
just explain what the actual scenario is.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the primary product?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this scenario,
[SPEAKER_06]: we take pelleted cellulose.
[SPEAKER_06]: We turn it into electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: We move it through the grid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes through the column.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we convert it into heat at 99%
efficiency in your room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the green part.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is perform heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the power plant, we've converted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just trying to point out,
this pelleted cellulose right here for
[SPEAKER_06]: electric heat is the same thing as the
pelleted cellulose for electric heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this column and this column are the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not electricity, process,
and product, but different end uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're using 19% here and driving miles
and 26 here for getting heat delivered to
[SPEAKER_00]: your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like you should probably
also reduce even the height of the gray
[SPEAKER_00]: bars according to the efficiency of
whatever system would be used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's a little bit
misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the efficiency for some heat is
only 26%, I mean, maybe the efficiency for
[SPEAKER_00]: the waste products is only 26%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't look as attractive,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I'm opening this up for
suggestions on improving this graph.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because actually, I love this graph
fiercely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did this in a light gray sort of
match this gray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for all intents and purposes,
this should be added up down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because most of the cases, it's not even
being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a potential use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, there are going to be efficiency
losses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know what those are.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is the range.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the criticism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally on board with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the green is purple.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be possible to add another bar in
the gray if there are cases where you can
[SPEAKER_11]: identify this is feasible.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is being done now.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some evidence of some small,
real functionality with the larger
[SPEAKER_11]: potential.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the major limitation as to why
that secondary release is not going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: used?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you calling it waste product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to go back to the one
scenario that I know, which is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why did that power plant not get the
user prepared?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a time when I was really getting
along with those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that the paper plant was using
waste heat to dry their paper pulp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, when you make paper,
it's going to use lots of heat in order to
[SPEAKER_06]: get all that moisture off in order to make
paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a great thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all your waste wood product can go
straight into the biomass plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: To generate more electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's an industrial area.
[SPEAKER_09]: It already has been state-of-the-art.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be less for natural gas than
actually using waste heat?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, there should be some
negotiation about the price of that waste
[SPEAKER_04]: heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems that it needs to be better
understanding of why that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if it comes down to green,
they're not going to be putting in gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to use furnaces to dry their
paper if they can use this on a cheaper
[SPEAKER_08]: rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other scenario, if I can tell you,
is from New York City, which used to all
[SPEAKER_06]: be CHP-combined heat and power in a
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we moved it out because of a
particular problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why it's not been used.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reason why it's all being made
at remote power plants, where who cares
[SPEAKER_04]: about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exactly my point.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, so the 14th Street power plant
in New York City, the one that went out
[SPEAKER_06]: when we had standard, and the whole lower
half of Manhattan had no electricity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that 14th Street power plant,
all the way up to 60th Street,
[SPEAKER_06]: all the way down to Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the waste heat, the steam,
heats all those buildings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs on natural gas, so it doesn't have
a particular matter problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also happens to be a very personal
problem, which is why it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just made the case of why it is being
used.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to understand why it's not
being used.
[SPEAKER_08]: What other efficiencies?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was in the context of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: In New York City, we had all kinds of
combined heat and power plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they were coal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the coal was making too much smoke in
the city with a high density population,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it remained out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a reason why the waste heat from
those old coal plants in the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could clean all these lands,
but why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell is a combined heat and power
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's all kinds of locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an ex-military building in New
York City, which is combined heat and
[SPEAKER_04]: power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was built in the 40s,
and it's 3,000 units.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they end up off the grid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have a condom sitting
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you could also think that it's a good
strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of having 60 power plants,
you've got 200 power plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're smaller, and they're all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting much better overall
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're collectively burning less fossil
fuels, because probably, for the most
[SPEAKER_06]: part, it's going to be fossil fuel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're using, if the waste heat
typically is like 50% of the biomass,
[SPEAKER_06]: or the energy product that goes in is
waste heat, you've just reduced your
[SPEAKER_06]: energy budget by half, because you're no
longer reduicating the heat lost from the
[SPEAKER_06]: electric plant and the heat used to heat
your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you saying that theoretically,
part of this problem is because we're
[SPEAKER_08]: power plants that we're paid to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is really a rotational problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a societal problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Power plants are located where they
actually do non-sacral generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's also the way the
economic economy is spinning about.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just think that they're not going to
save some of the terms.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not spinning about efficiency.
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of this is why
[SPEAKER_09]: don't we use the way we did to drive away
hardships?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the volume of which the
chips go in and how much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think they're run out of chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're planning lots of glitches
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do see that it's not only the power
operation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've always had excess heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the problem was, what do we do with
this heat?
[SPEAKER_09]: But that means that society and people
like myself and politicians need to think
[SPEAKER_09]: about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, what this indicates is that this
much people or some fraction of this much
[SPEAKER_06]: people, if you want to adjust climate
change, this is a really fast,
[SPEAKER_06]: effective way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you, for New Year's this year,
I was talking in my heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I picked a rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm not supposed to pick a rose
in my heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was an extraordinary situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I afforded myself the freedom of
picking the rose in my heart on New Year's
[SPEAKER_04]: Day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because until that moment, I had never
conceived of being able to pick a rose on
[SPEAKER_04]: a birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my birthday is on New Year's.
[SPEAKER_04]: My birthday is on the 10th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for the first time in my entire
life, I thought, maybe I'll be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: pick a rose on my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a huge freeze spell and a whole lot
of roses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point here is that we're living in
a conceptually different moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was absolutely inconceivable for
me to be able to pick a rose on my
[SPEAKER_04]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is no longer inconceivably,
because the system is rapidly changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we want to address climate change,
I would argue that looking at the waste
[SPEAKER_06]: heat from our electricity system,
and I don't mean it necessarily has to be
[SPEAKER_06]: from biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly, I hope you recognize that all of
this biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have bucolic landscapes instead
of 7% of our energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think we could cut out 7% of
your energy to have bucolic landscapes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: These are real choices that we can
actually make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not making those kinds of
choices.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of choices, how are you going to
price your thoughts on the ethical issues
[SPEAKER_09]: of burning corneas for energy versus these
are for food?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have absolutely no problem with burning
corn, because if you walk out there today,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if I had a juice, I have enough
calories on my body right now to make it
[SPEAKER_04]: through the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I had to be out there with no heat,
I would really like to burn that corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the issue is that corn is so
energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so energy intensive to produce that
you could produce all other kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really think there's a food and
fuel argument.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, you could have corn,
or you could have corn ethanol to run in a
[SPEAKER_04]: hummer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have an emaciated dog,
and you could chase a tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, that's what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just add to your answer?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe I'll subtract it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, on a sort of a literal sense,
so the calculation of this large potential
[SPEAKER_11]: biomass, that's in addition to the food,
feed, and fiber we're producing in the
[SPEAKER_11]: state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd be growing this in a marginal
area, so that there was not growing feed
[SPEAKER_11]: corn?
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's growing on land, but it's not
currently producing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that doesn't mean you're still making
the choice to use all that land to produce
[SPEAKER_11]: biomass instead of additional food or
fuel.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then the food, and then the corn,
and these are food quarter qualities as
[SPEAKER_10]: well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Corn kernels are corn kernels?
[SPEAKER_09]: Corn kernels are corn
[SPEAKER_09]: kernels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Corn kernels are corn kernels.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're using nutrients to produce the
fuel, and you don't need nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_09]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do in the food, you don't feed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So could we change that so that we want to
see any of the plant-brained, anybody in
[SPEAKER_09]: plant-brained is going to be looking at
breeding corn, or any grain, but no
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients in the grain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the advantage of a tree,
right, is that the trunk is covered.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not nutrient.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, there has been little bit
pre-done, you know, starting to work out
[SPEAKER_09]: on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just in one place, some of
[SPEAKER_09]: you try to get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could find nothing relevant to life.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we
[SPEAKER_09]: should stop it here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's give Jenny another hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
