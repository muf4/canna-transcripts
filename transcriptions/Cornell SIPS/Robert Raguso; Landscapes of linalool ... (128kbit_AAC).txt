[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Gaurav.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be the chair of NBNB, but I love
being a member of this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for sharing your students with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a great 10 years, and I look
forward to stepping down as chair and
[SPEAKER_04]: being a more active member of your field
and getting back to enjoy more of my
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: The themes of research in my lab are
multiple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in how volatiles mediate
interactions across the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_04]: positive, neutral, and negative
interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we look at how volatiles might mediate
obligate mutualism, whether there's
[SPEAKER_04]: private channels that evolve between
plants like figs and fig wasps or yuccas
[SPEAKER_04]: and yucca moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also study, and this is obviously an
honest form of communication between two
[SPEAKER_04]: intimately tied mutualists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also study dishonest communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are splacnam dung mosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are, along with cycads and a
few rushes, some of the few examples of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that have independently evolved
flower-like combinations of color and
[SPEAKER_04]: scent and other traits that attract
animals to move their propagules,
[SPEAKER_04]: in this case spores instead of pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also study sort of third parties in the
evolutionary shifts of phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of you know Kyle Martin.
[SPEAKER_04]: His thesis work is involved in whether
microbes lend a hand in shifts between
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of classic beetle and bee pollinated
flowers to flowers that mimic carrion or
[SPEAKER_04]: feces or rotting or fermenting fruit or
yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, these night blooming flowers
that I'm going to talk about today,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are found throughout the world and
are pollinated by hawk moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the first plants that I studied
in my thesis and postdoc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And largely because they're so strongly
scented, at the time the analytical
[SPEAKER_04]: methods I used were not very sensitive and
they gave me the best chance to really
[SPEAKER_04]: confidently sample volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can sample almost anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the outline for today's talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to introduce you to linalal,
a ubiquitous common scent compound that
[SPEAKER_04]: just happens to be a major player in night
blooming flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't I set the stage a little bit
for understanding this compound and its
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first talk that I'm giving on
a project that's just about to end five
[SPEAKER_04]: years of funding from NSF on a program
called the Dimensions of Biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big collaborative project,
five PIs, two million dollars,
[SPEAKER_04]: five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chance to really build something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're going to get the first
glimpse of what we've been learning from
[SPEAKER_04]: this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to set the stage for you of
how we designed it, what kind of questions
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to home in on one single
endemic species, a prairie species in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado, Enothera harringtonii,
which I've brought along with me as I
[SPEAKER_04]: speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pass this around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see the plant, which we work
on trees or sidecads.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't always do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is Enothera harringtonii,
star of today's show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to drill down deep into how
Enothera harringtonii interacts with its
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and enemies across its known
distribution in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to finish up by scaling up
to the phylogenetic scale and looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: the genus Enothera, at least in Western
North America, and asking if some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: patterns and processes that we think we're
discovering in Enothera harringtonii are
[SPEAKER_04]: also shared with its closer and more
distant relatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we're going today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's begin by talking about linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know anything about floral
volatiles?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do we start?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many ways to concentrate and
collect volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm showing you here is a kind of
equilibration method.
[SPEAKER_04]: For today's talk, we actually collect
odors over time, so we get emission rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole idea is that you trap or
adsorb volatiles onto a substance that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can either elute with a solvent,
or you can strip thermally into,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, a gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we do is when we collect our
volatile samples, which we optimize
[SPEAKER_04]: through trial and error for a given
species, we inject them into the GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use two different kinds of GC columns to
separate complex blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we always need a detector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the detector we use is a single
quadrupole mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I do a good job, my
chromatograms look like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: At each peak, this is time and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is abundance of signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so each peak, presumably, is a single
compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you know what that compound is?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the mass spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mass spectrum provides you with a
hint.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, this is a classic mass
spectrum for today's compound of interest,
[SPEAKER_04]: linalal, which is a monoterpene alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: But getting a mass spectrum isn't an
identification.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do then is you buy the standard,
or you make it if you can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you co-inject it with your sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they share a retention time,
you do it again on another compound,
[SPEAKER_04]: another column, another stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're always co-eluting,
and then you go and look at the possible
[SPEAKER_04]: isomers or the other compounds with
similar mass spectra, and you demonstrate
[SPEAKER_04]: to yourself, to your own satisfaction,
that they're not all co-eluting at 11
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes or whatever this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can go on to use IR or NMR to
identify these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a kind of Beatles' greatest
hits of floral volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 1,700 that have been identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the same 10 or 20 just show up all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And linalal is about number six.
[SPEAKER_04]: So although today's context is
night-blooming flowers pollinated by
[SPEAKER_04]: moths, you can find linalal in all kinds
of diurnal flowers, in orchids,
[SPEAKER_04]: in early Daphnes blooming, in the
Mediterranean, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one take-home message is going to be
that the roles of floral volatiles are
[SPEAKER_04]: often context-dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their ecological functions often have to
do with dosage, time of day or night,
[SPEAKER_04]: who's the receiver, what's the community
context, what's it associated with,
[SPEAKER_04]: honest or dishonest pollination services,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we think we have linalal,
then we need to start looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to do justice to Roman
Kaiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are literally thousands of great
chemists over the last 50 years who
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed us to use capillary GCNM and mass
spec as a way of identifying volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, only one of them translated
the vast knowledge from perfumery and
[SPEAKER_04]: essential oil research into floral
biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was Roman Kaiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a guy who worked for Givaldan,
a perfume company in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_04]: traveled the world looking for new odors
for his company, and had carte blanche
[SPEAKER_04]: from his employers to publish his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he wrote these gorgeous books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where he shows the organic synthesis,
and he shows the chromatography.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was so far ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so Mozart to everybody's Salieri's
that he just shared everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as a graduate student, I met him,
and I learned a lot from him that I
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't have really taught myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Roman Kaiser did first is he hid
all of the usual suspects for perfume.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like white night blooming flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smell great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee, citrus, honeysuckle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gardenia, jasmine, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he kind of did his own mental
principal components analysis and found
[SPEAKER_04]: there's this guild across the planet of
white semi-tropical night blooming plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that all smell like gardenias.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he found is that there's a core
of linalal, neuraldole, farnesal.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are terpenoid alcohols.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're soluble in nectar, so they can be
flavors as well as scents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to that core, he found things
like aromatic alcohols and esters,
[SPEAKER_04]: lactones, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that adds some of the spice and
difference to these different compounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: to these different floral cords.
[SPEAKER_04]: But linalal was almost always there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I became a grad student,
this is what I read.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a study of my own with an actual
geographic grant and a Fulbright.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first sabbatical was in South Africa
about 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were comparing guilds of night
blooming plants blooming
[SPEAKER_04]: hawkmoth-pollinated plants at the same
latitude on opposite sides of the planet
[SPEAKER_04]: in Argentina and South Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we found was that linalal was
present in a lot of these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their floral tubes and their
morphology was all sort of a textbook
[SPEAKER_04]: example of conversion evolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawk moths are universal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can fly across oceans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so their kind of selective pressure
that they bring upon flowering plants
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't really differ that much between
islands or continents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, I became aware that
linalal was chiral.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because I was finding it in my
chromatography didn't mean I knew which
[SPEAKER_04]: linalal it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to invest in a chiral GC column.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, many compounds that flowers
produce as volatiles have chiral centers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because insects respond differently to
them, their receptors are often tuned to
[SPEAKER_04]: the left-handed or right-handed molecule,
you kind of have to go that extra step and
[SPEAKER_04]: identify which enantiomer or enantiomers
you're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a slide to show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to dwell on the biochemistry
very much today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the structural genes that encode
linalal are part of a huge gene family,
[SPEAKER_04]: the turpanic synthase family.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I worked on as a grad student in
Clarkia, Brewery with Aron Pacherski was
[SPEAKER_04]: an S plus linalal synthase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the ones that are more common in
the literature are from tomato and mint
[SPEAKER_04]: are R minus linalal synthase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are not each other's closest
relatives in this gene family.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just to show you that many
structural genes and their enzymes that
[SPEAKER_04]: are responsible for the biosynthesis of
specific volatiles are evolving
[SPEAKER_04]: repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so putting a name on them,
linalal synthase, doesn't actually mean
[SPEAKER_04]: anything in terms of their sequence
similarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of homoplasia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of repeated and parallel
evolution in this gene family.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many ways to make these
compounds, in other words.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's talk about Hawkmoth a little and
why this matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't read a textbook on evolution
without Darwin's Star Orchid from
[SPEAKER_04]: Madagascar and its 23 centimeter nectar
tube and the predicted Hawkmoth Santhopan
[SPEAKER_04]: Morgani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there have been a lot of people
including Anders Nielsen who have based
[SPEAKER_04]: their careers on following Darwin and
proposing that, well, OK, this is an
[SPEAKER_04]: example of fishery and runaway selection,
but it's not sexual selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's flowers and pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how do you get a tube that long and
a tongue that long?
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be the cycling of you withhold
the nectar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make the animal shove its head into
the flower more closely so that it
[SPEAKER_04]: transfers pollen more effectively and that
then mutants of the moth and have longer
[SPEAKER_04]: tongues are more effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: But doing that in the plants and moths are
stuck in a cycle of longer and longer
[SPEAKER_04]: tongues and tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things happen on islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: This made a lot of sense in 1993.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've done a lot of work on the
moth side of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my first grad student,
Joaquin Goire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what Joaquin did in a kind of
Tinbergen-esque way was work out what's
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole sequence of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get a motivated Hawkmoth,
what are the sequence of events that gets
[SPEAKER_04]: it to put out its tongue, approach a
flower, and drink?
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all experiments that Joaquin
and I and others have done together over
[SPEAKER_04]: the years and published.
[SPEAKER_04]: And floral scent is involved in many of
these early stages of getting a moth to
[SPEAKER_04]: recognize a bright object as a flower,
as well as guiding its tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And linalol is one of the compounds that
we've shown and others have shown,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Jeff Riffle, to sort of release this
searching and probing behavior in moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in fact, while I'm talking about
linalol, I want to pass around some
[SPEAKER_04]: linalol for you to sniff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you are familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in bergamot oil, earl grey tea,
fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pass these around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the racemic mix for those of
you who really want to know which
[SPEAKER_04]: enantiomer it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we learned a lot over the last
decade about how Hawkmoths respond to
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers and how they might affect that
kind of selective pressure on longer
[SPEAKER_04]: nectar tubes and strong overstated floral
scents.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, in real ecology,
just as in courtship between animals,
[SPEAKER_04]: third parties make a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of eavesdropping that goes
on out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Guppy's well-known John Endler studies,
where Guppy males that live in streams
[SPEAKER_04]: that don't have cichlid fish have the most
wonderful, orange, long, flowery fantasia
[SPEAKER_04]: tails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they attract females and win them as
mates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when the cichlids are present as
predators, they can't have those big
[SPEAKER_04]: tails, because those are the ones that the
cichlids will eat first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's always this sort of balancing
selection on how wildly can you display
[SPEAKER_04]: without attracting enemies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in flowers, that's been shown
repeatedly over the last 20 years that
[SPEAKER_04]: floral display to pollinators is often
checked by third party enemies that are
[SPEAKER_04]: attracted to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for today's talk, the enemies that you
need to know about are these little moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the genus is Mompha.
[SPEAKER_04]: The family is the Momphidae.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're related to yucca moths,
sort of broadly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they come in three flavors
ecologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some seed predators that the
caterpillars burrow into the ovules.
[SPEAKER_04]: They live in the locules, and then they
finish eating all the seeds, and they spin
[SPEAKER_04]: a cocoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a yucca moth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are budgallers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ones where the female moths lay eggs on
the bud, the caterpillars go into the bud,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then emasculate, actually eat all the
sex organs and defecate into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a huge fitness loss in both of
these cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I'm not showing here is that
there's also leaf miners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the ancestral condition in the
Momphas are to mine leaves or to spin webs
[SPEAKER_04]: around Mary's stump and then use that as a
home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all kind of galling,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're specialized in the Mertelis,
and particularly in Western North America,
[SPEAKER_04]: where the Anagraceae has a radiation with
the repeated desertification of the
[SPEAKER_04]: continent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get these guys showing up again and
again in different hosts.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Darwin-Nielsen view of coevolution
is binary.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the moths, and they're
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the relationship between tongue length
and tube length might co-vary with
[SPEAKER_04]: latitude or altitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are the sources of selective
pressure, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: And these should match each other in
nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is almost like an isometric
scaling, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You scale up if you have a Manduka.
[SPEAKER_04]: You scale down if you have a Hylies in
Idaho instead of Arizona, because it's too
[SPEAKER_04]: cold at night for these big guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you're making osamine and linalol
at various amounts that are proportional
[SPEAKER_04]: to the surface area of the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great if it were true,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we did work on this species,
Enothera cespitosa, in Jackson Hole,
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming, horrible place to work,
the Mampha, well, here, Hylies
[SPEAKER_04]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so this white-lined sphinx moth is a
great pollinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a price.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lays eggs on the buds of the flowers,
and their caterpillars eat flowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there, the flowers are staying open
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're opening up more broadly,
and they're losing linalol and making
[SPEAKER_04]: geraniol instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're pollinated by these huge
amphephora bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant, wonderful silver bees with very
long tongues.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get up at 6 in the morning to
see them, but they pollinate every flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Moab, Utah, they're getting
hammered by these Mampha guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they're doing is they're slamming
shut the flare of the flower, because what
[SPEAKER_04]: we learned is that if the female Mampha
can get in and get a drink of nectar,
[SPEAKER_04]: they come running out, they drop into the
rosette, and they start laying eggs in the
[SPEAKER_04]: bud primordia.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time those caterpillars hatch,
there's a nice developing bud for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a gall out of, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they can't get that nectar meal,
they'll move on to another plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's directional selection here to
slam that shut, and they lose linalol as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we even began this study,
we knew that there was geographic
[SPEAKER_04]: variation in not only scent, but also
flower morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't just isometrically scaling
up and down with pollinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So John Thompson's view of coevolution is
about geographic mosaics, where some
[SPEAKER_04]: populations, the predator has a stronger
selective effect than the pollinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the flowers respond accordingly
in evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other populations, the predator isn't
there because it's got a parasite or
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's another host plant that's
even better for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those plants are released from that
selective pressure, and they can more
[SPEAKER_04]: directly match the morphology and the
sensory biology, biological needs of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what Thompson suggested is that
there should be a whole mosaic across the
[SPEAKER_04]: populations of these plants where there's
mismatches.
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be matched traits with the
pollinators and other places where they're
[SPEAKER_04]: matching the pollinators really well,
depending on local selective pressures.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wrote a grant to the Dimensions of
Diversity program and got it on the first
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the only time in my life I got a
grant on the first try.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this grant had been, this proposal had
been submitted as a regular grant for
[SPEAKER_04]: three previous years as a pre-proposal,
but just slam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair, poor, go away, quit science.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not transformative.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least I had tenure, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those of you who don't know,
the program, which I think has just
[SPEAKER_04]: ceased, is so interesting because it takes
the normal amount of funding and cobbles
[SPEAKER_04]: it into a team and extends it from three
to five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have five PIs, maximum of $2 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the criteria are that you study
diversification or diversity on three
[SPEAKER_04]: different scales, functional, genomic,
and phylogenetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so your job as a grant writer is to
convince the panel that you've got that
[SPEAKER_04]: and that it matters and that that's going
to tell a story that any one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: approaches isn't going to tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way we outlined it was to model
intensive surveying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to choose one focal species in
enothera and really nail it, study the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole range.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted an endemic, something that
wasn't found over 10 states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really understand what are the
conflicting selective pressures from the
[SPEAKER_04]: enemy and the friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there hot spots and cold spots?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there mismatches in the traits?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we standardize the way that we
collected our data, could we see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second part would be that we
would start moving backwards into the
[SPEAKER_04]: lineage and start looking at sibling
species or couplets of species in
[SPEAKER_04]: different parts of Western North America
and ask, do the patterns that we saw here
[SPEAKER_04]: in our focal species, actually,
are they shared in common across the
[SPEAKER_04]: lineage to which it belongs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we wanted to take a really broad
look at the end and ask for the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: genus enothera, in fact, for the whole
family on Agresae, and for the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: lineage of moths that give rise to MAMFA,
are they co-speciating?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this tit for tat co-evolution?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they locked in an arms race?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there other things that we didn't
anticipate, like life history strategies
[SPEAKER_04]: or the kind of fruits that they make that
might lock out a MAMFA moth if it's trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to use fruits as a place to live?
[SPEAKER_04]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enothera don't change their flowers that
much, but they change everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no enothera trees, but there's
lots of diversity in floral form.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me focus now on what we learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: From our focal study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we decided to work on this species
enothera herringtonii.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an annual, and it's
self-incompatible, so we could study its
[SPEAKER_04]: lifetime fitness in a single season.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could grow it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I passed it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a while to bloom, but they're
very, very happy in terracotta pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: They live only here in the Arkansas River
drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their whole world, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's about 25 or 30 known
populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hit most of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Chris Eskogen was the driver of this
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris is a conservation geneticist from
Ken Holsinger's group at the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Connecticut, and she got a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: She grew up in Fargo and wanted to get
back to the prairie, so she got a job in
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicago Botanic Garden, and we started
studying this prairie plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what it looks like in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what did we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: We standardized our collection of
pollinator data, of herbivore data,
[SPEAKER_04]: of floral scent and nectar and flower
measurements across five or six years,
[SPEAKER_04]: even before we got the grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started working in 2008 and 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are pollinated poorly by large
moths because they don't quite fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pollinated extremely well by the
white line sphinx, which is also laying
[SPEAKER_04]: eggs on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're visited by these pollen
scavenging bees at dawn that do nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're one and done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They visit one flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They carry all the pollen they can carry
and go straight to the nest and lay an egg
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are pollen thieves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And across all these different
populations, there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: variation in the relative abundance of
bees and moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we found was that there was no
variation in their identity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from Colorado Springs and Pueblo in the
foothills of the eastern slope of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockies all the way out into the prairie,
they're basically getting the same
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, the same enemies, the same
ecology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there's some variation in the
sort of edaphic ecology there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our first round, we had 12 populations,
15 to 30 plants per population.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of chromatography.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found something strange.
[SPEAKER_04]: That out in the southeast, the flowers
almost never had linalool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas in the northwest and down into
Wolsenburg, linalool was a major peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this wasn't subtle.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a complete drop off as you leave
the foothills and go out onto the prairie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there could be a lot of explanations
for that that aren't adaptive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't often see something like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought going from a major peak to
nothing is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to follow up on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did a couple of unbiased surveys
and statistical analyses just to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: we weren't guilty of circular thinking,
we weren't too excited about linalool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be all kinds of other things
going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we measured everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you see here are all the floral
volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything in gray is a measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower flare, tube length, corolla
diameter, hercogamy, and from all these
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we put them into random forest,
which is a machine learning algorithm
[SPEAKER_04]: which tells you what variables are
responsible for separating populations out
[SPEAKER_04]: from each other statistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you look for is a Gini
coefficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest one by far was our friend
R minus linalool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another floral volatile up there,
jasmine lactone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some floral morphometrics
that are giving larger Gini coefficients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest of the volatiles are pretty
paltry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know what this is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the chromatography.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Florence is in the foothills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a big linalool peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this mass spectrum again.
[SPEAKER_04]: David's Canyon is out by La Junta.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the prairie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no linalool at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is presence, absence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rest are kind of typical
flower volatiles, osmines, karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a jasmine lactone that makes these
things smell like gardenias, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: phenyl acetonitrile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which linalool is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought a chiral column.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the racemic mix from sigma,
R minus S plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's coriander, which is S plus only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's R minus only, which you can buy
from sigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the enothera with and without
the spike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's definitely making, if not
completely all R minus, then mostly all.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bump here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if it's also making a little bit
of S plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's hugely dominant R minus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it drift?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: You originally studied enothera
harringtonii because that part of Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: is getting hammered by human change.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cities of Pueblo and Colorado Springs
are growing in all directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of light pollution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawk moths can't come to flowers if
they're flying around stadium lights and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting eaten by bats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought, oh, there could be some
local drift if these populations aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: getting pollinated by moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this amazing gene flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: FST is tiny across these 25 populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anurag Agrawal developed microsatellite
primers for enothera biennis, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: common weed around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they work for enothera harringtonii.
[SPEAKER_04]: This result shows that there's huge
amounts of gene flow between all these
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at the structure analysis
and we look at the alleles for these
[SPEAKER_04]: microsats, there's tacit support for maybe
three conceptual populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no private alleles.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no evidence that would make you
think, Rob, this is drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a neutral trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gene flow across this whole
region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just another way of doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is QST versus FST, looking at
quantitative variation in greenhouse-grown
[SPEAKER_04]: heritability-type study, comparing it
against FST.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for all the scent traits and floral
morphology, only linalal and the jasmine
[SPEAKER_04]: lactone come out looking significantly
higher than what we'd expect by neutral
[SPEAKER_04]: models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like it might be adaptive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The variation in linalal might be
adaptive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at the map.
[SPEAKER_04]: We filled it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went back.
[SPEAKER_04]: First year we got the grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went back and hit the other
populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we've got 19 populations with
microsats and floral scent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the colored pie charts, every time you
see yellow, that's the proportion of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in the population that have
linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the amount of linalal in the floral
scent on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see that in the Northwest,
they're really putting out a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that peters out in the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the questions was,
is there a difference in pollinators?
[SPEAKER_04]: I already showed you a slide showing you
that's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in fact, when we lump all the
linalal-producing and non-producing
[SPEAKER_04]: populations together and look at their
average visitation rates for hawk moths
[SPEAKER_04]: and for bees, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things are almost uniform across
their range.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have gene flow, and they have the
same floral visitors and pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for you to have a different trait in
the face of all that also suggests that
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got something adaptive going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question was, well,
what about enemies?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, Hylies is visiting the flowers,
but they're also turning around and
[SPEAKER_04]: dropping eggs on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if the herbivore pressure from the
caterpillars of Hylies might be a problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as MAMFA?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so then when we look at the
caterpillars and eggs, this is eggs of
[SPEAKER_04]: white lion sphinx, there's a lot more eggs
on the plants when there's no linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: When there's linalal, there's relatively
few eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here, what we have is MAMFA seed
predation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the proportion of fruits that have
MAMFA in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when linalal is present,
there's more of those fruits that are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting hammered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's something weird going on here,
that linalal might actually help the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: fight against Hylies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be calling the third trophic
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be calling in egg predators and
first instar larva predators to remove
[SPEAKER_04]: those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But linalal may make the plant vulnerable
to MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the question is, you're assuming
that they can smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're assuming that they care.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, go to the wind tunnel and do a
bioassay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that with Hylies, because we
have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: MAMFA is a wild animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't yet raise it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jeff Broadhead ran some
electroantennograms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what these are is here's the
response to hexane, which is nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: special.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the antenna responding to R
plus linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, and that's a nice deflection.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good sized amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a one in 1,000 dilution of linalal
and hexane.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's MAMFA antennae responding to
the same stimulus, not very much to hexane
[SPEAKER_04]: and very, very nicely to R minus linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it's responding to a rolled up flower
petal in a pasture pipette.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the whole blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just proof of concept that they
can smell these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, it doesn't mean behaviorally that they
like them, but at least they can smell
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the units?
[SPEAKER_04]: The vertical units are millivolts and the
horizontal are time in seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The red bar is the duration of the
stimulus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're puffing an odor over an antenna
and then stopping the puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so these are a half second each and
these are a second each.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so here I want to show you a
great video that Sol Babuena collected
[SPEAKER_04]: just a few days ago of how Haileys handled
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a first visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoth has never seen this flower before.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, and so you can see the amazing contact
that it made with the stigma and with the
[SPEAKER_04]: fear it's pulled off a lot of pollen on
its legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see this in the field all the time,
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actually done in a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the dot?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a satay spike with a septum on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the segue into a field
experiment that we did where we added
[SPEAKER_04]: linalal to flowers that didn't have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what Sol is doing in these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's flying moths to flowers from the
David's Canyon population that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's adding linalal to half of them
and not to the others and asking if the
[SPEAKER_04]: moths care.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK,
[SPEAKER_04]: now here's the other star.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Manfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've shown you still photos of her,
but you need to see how she behaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, look at the antenna.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is drumming her antennae on the
surface of the petal.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is at dusk, the same time that
Haileys visits the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollinator and enemy responding to the
same cues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what she did later on in that sequence
is she went all the way down that tube and
[SPEAKER_04]: took a drink, came out, and dropped an
egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had that on film, but we've seen
it now 100 times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we needed to do was an
augmentation experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to knock in traits to a plant
that you haven't worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, genomically.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we certainly could get the emission
rates right and add them to the plants out
[SPEAKER_04]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is David's Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short grass prairie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty amazing open place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We supplemented linalal on flowers every
day for about five weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70% of the flowers got linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We measured herbivory, the number of eggs,
the number of caterpillars, the damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at pollen deposition and removal
from flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We collected all the fruits to score the
presence of MAFA caterpillars and their
[SPEAKER_04]: feces and loss of seeds, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just to show you that the
augmentation worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're adding odor at time zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then an hour later, we're collecting
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just a slow decay curve over
the whole night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after sunrise, the emission rates
increased a little bit because it got
[SPEAKER_04]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, these plants continued.
[SPEAKER_04]: The treatments continued to emit linalal
through the night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't a 15-minute experiment,
which would have been an easy criticism.
[SPEAKER_04]: We nailed not only the first hour when
both friend and foe were visiting the
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers, but we kept it going all night.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to use path analysis here
to show you what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you add linalal, it increases pollen
deposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a positive coefficient here,
a significant coefficient, probably
[SPEAKER_04]: because of more pollinator visitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not sure, because we couldn't be
there to see all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bees never deposit pollen,
so it's probably the hawkmoths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Linalal, addition of linalal, also
significantly increased infestation by
[SPEAKER_04]: MAFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are plants that don't make
linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we jacked up the number of MAFA larvae
we were finding in the fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing it did is it knocked down
the number of caterpillars, but not the
[SPEAKER_04]: number of eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So adding linalal didn't reduce
overposition on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: By female hawkmoths, what it did is it
reduced the survivorship or the presence
[SPEAKER_04]: of the caterpillars once they hatched from
those eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know if that means that they left
the plant or they got killed, but they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's putting it all together that
linalal has a positive effect on MAFA,
[SPEAKER_04]: which has a negative effect on seed
fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a classic path analysis result
that the friend of your enemy is your
[SPEAKER_04]: friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it suggests that what we're seeing in
the southeast part of the range,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we did this experiment, is that
linalal is a liability, that if flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: were to make it there, they would incur
fitness loss by more seed predation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went back to the corridor where the
MAFA infestation was highest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's this road down here,
Interstate 25, down to Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these populations down here had the
highest MAFA infestation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went back the next year,
2017, to these four populations or five
[SPEAKER_04]: populations, and we did a correlative
study.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a phenotypic selection study where
you regress fruit set and seed fitness
[SPEAKER_04]: against everything you can measure,
flower size, flower number, linalal
[SPEAKER_04]: emission rates, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are five populations over here in
this sort of death alley for MAFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these other traits, corolla diameter,
flare, tube length, hercogamy,
[SPEAKER_04]: nectar volume, sucrose, the major four
compounds, none of these departed from
[SPEAKER_04]: null expectations in any of the five
populations except linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened only in rouse,
which is right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was funny about rouse was that it
was an alley effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a small population with small
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we think is happening is that a
large robust plant with 80 flowers per
[SPEAKER_04]: year can tolerate damage from MAFA months
because it's still gonna make 50 or 60
[SPEAKER_04]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a small plant in a bad year with no
second chance because it's an annual and
[SPEAKER_04]: no ability to self-pollinate, that's when
the screws get tightened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we think after five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we think we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And coefficients are not very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the assays together, lead us to
believe that this is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in sum, plant size and whatever
abiotic factors influence plant size is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably setting the context for whether
this hurts that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me finish by asking if we scale
this up outside of Colorado, outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: this one species that we obsessed with for
five years, do we see anything else that's
[SPEAKER_04]: useful?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we see these patterns propagating
across the American West?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we see in John Thompson's parlance a
geographic mosaic of coevolutionary
[SPEAKER_04]: processes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the family on a Gracie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for the lack of confidence
values, but this is a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to show you that the ancestral
condition for the whole group is almost
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly bee pollination with one or two
transitions to hummingbird pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not indicative of species
richness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuxia is a huge genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Epilobium is a huge genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just focusing on a Enothera here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Enothera itself probably was
ancestrally bee pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have strong support for a lot of these
transitions here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like there was one major
transition to hawk moth pollination at the
[SPEAKER_04]: root of many of these Enothera lineages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they translate to
self-pollination or noctuid moth
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination or back to bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to capture some of this
diversity phyletically.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some of the species that we
worked with, including Clarkia,
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant I worked with as a grad student,
one species out of 45 that's hawk moth
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's several different clades
represented here in our plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we wanted to do was hit 15
different species strategically chosen to
[SPEAKER_04]: represent couplets, closely related
species whose biology we suspected was
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's their relationships
phylogenetically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you see here is that for each
color bar, that's a species, and each one
[SPEAKER_04]: of them had three to five populations that
we went out and sampled over five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're all color coded across the
American West.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now again, not a bad place to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no normal years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year is different for rainfall and
for the early onset of blooming or a great
[SPEAKER_04]: monsoon and everything blooms again in the
Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_04]: Desert in August, the first year of the
project, we had a September bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gotta run and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we wanted to do is capture some
of that population level variation that we
[SPEAKER_04]: had seen in Inithera herringtonii out
here, try to get sort of smaller versions
[SPEAKER_04]: of that variation in as many other species
as we could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our approach was again to bring out
large teams and standardized data
[SPEAKER_04]: collection, floral scent, morphology,
nectar, pollinator visitation,
[SPEAKER_04]: herbivory, Haileys eggs and larvae,
MAMFA in the buds and in the fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked in 58 populations, many,
many states.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a lot of work, most of the budget
of the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet the players are so similar across
the whole family, the same enemies,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here's a quick look.
[SPEAKER_04]: The linalal polymorphism extended well
beyond Inithera herringtonii, differs
[SPEAKER_04]: among sibling species and among
populations with different species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple of independent origins
of S plus linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew about Clarkia brurii because
that's what I'd studied as a grad student.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's another one in the section
Callilophis that accompanied a switch from
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawk Moth ancestry to bee pollination in
West Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's a couple of examples here
where an ancestry is likely a linalal
[SPEAKER_04]: producer and there's been an inferred loss
of R minus linalal.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, here this is a switch to bee
pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is still being pollinated by
Hawk Moths like some of the populations of
[SPEAKER_04]: Inithera herringtonii.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here, Inithera brachycarpa has
the largest flowers in the genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes no sense and it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is almost entirely vegetatively
propagating at this point and it's being
[SPEAKER_04]: destroyed by MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't know how they're finding the
flowers, but they've almost given up on
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinator display.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the question we asked is if you
take all of this data, can we ask to what
[SPEAKER_04]: extent pollinators versus MAMFA are
structuring some of the data, the
[SPEAKER_04]: variation in the data sets?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do a phylogenetically
controlled multiple regression and taking
[SPEAKER_04]: into account phylogenetic distance,
geographic distance, pollinator distance
[SPEAKER_04]: and which species of MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the coefficients we got for
pollinators were both for morphology and
[SPEAKER_04]: scent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for MAMFA, interestingly enough,
even though we know that flower trumpet
[SPEAKER_04]: flare matters to MAMFA, at this
phylogenetic scale, they were explaining
[SPEAKER_04]: more variation in scent and not so much in
morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the right to look at it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically a principal components
analysis of flower morphology across all
[SPEAKER_04]: of our taxa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you see here are the bee
pollinated ones are clustering up here in
[SPEAKER_04]: a morpho space.
[SPEAKER_04]: The highly small, medium-sized hawk-moth
pollinated ones are clustering over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the ones with really long tongues
and tubes are clustering down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pollinators are very nicely explaining
variation in morpho space, although each
[SPEAKER_04]: of these dots has a different population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly in many cases, there's
considerable variation between populations
[SPEAKER_04]: of the same species.
[SPEAKER_04]: For scent, these are all hawk-moth
pollinated species, and they're all over
[SPEAKER_04]: the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of them are making R-linolol,
but that's not a strong predictor.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nitrogenous compounds down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's S-linolol up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at also the spread in morpho
space or in chemical space of these
[SPEAKER_04]: populations of the same species.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are close.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the bee pollinated ones are off in
the periphery.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are really leaving the chemical
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So between them, we have a lot of
structure here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what MAMFA does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the same phylogenetic
relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pie charts, if they're blue,
mean that that species, at least in some
[SPEAKER_04]: populations, has R-linolol, which we've
been talking about all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're yellow, they've switched to
S-linolol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_04]: It attracts moths, but we don't know if it
attracts MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if they're gray, they've lost
L-linolol entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here, the black bars show how many
populations in species X has infestation
[SPEAKER_04]: from MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some species are free of MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Others are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're tracking the different
kinds of MAMFAs, the flower bud galling
[SPEAKER_04]: ones and the seed capsule galling ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the good news is there's an awful lot
of stuff going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad news is there's not a clear
direction of one MAMFA species driving
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers to be silent, removing scent
entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, there's other species that
are shifting to diurnal bee pollination
[SPEAKER_04]: and are still getting hammered by MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would imagine that maybe those flowers
would be under selection to close at night
[SPEAKER_04]: when MAMFA are active.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to wrap up, what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_04]: Linolol emission is certainly a labile
trait within population species and
[SPEAKER_04]: sections of enothera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've shown you that it's found across
the world in all kinds of other angiosperm
[SPEAKER_04]: families.
[SPEAKER_04]: Linolol appears to be selected against by
seed predator MAMFA moths without
[SPEAKER_04]: sacrificing highly pollination services,
which leads to the question of why is
[SPEAKER_04]: Linolol needed at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need enthera herringtonii and
similar species.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a phylogenetic artifact.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shared derived trait in that group
of enothera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Escape from MAMFA might involve the loss
of Linolol.
[SPEAKER_04]: The switch to a different enantiomer of
Linolol, switch to bee pollination,
[SPEAKER_04]: or switch to self pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And herbivores in some clearly play
important roles and complex roles as
[SPEAKER_04]: selective agents on florals and variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank the big team that we
worked with in the field over five years,
[SPEAKER_04]: Amherst College, Chicago Botanic Garden,
and Warren Wagner from the Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, Jeff Broadhead,
Sol Babuena, and Deidre Jacobson for
[SPEAKER_04]: helping us to study some of these
interactions here in Cornell during the
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our funding sources and cooperators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look forward to questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had some species of enothera there
with no MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any evidence of chemicals which
are repelling the system from attracting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is another prediction of the
geographic mosaic, that not all odors are
[SPEAKER_04]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there should be strong selective
pressure either to hide or to push away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do the experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting that the second compound
that showed up in the QST FST analysis was
[SPEAKER_04]: jasmine lactone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a common compound in flowers,
except in jasmine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But lactones have a repellent quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: In insect control, lactones can often be
repellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a compound that we could
actually add to flowers and see if we
[SPEAKER_04]: reduce MAMFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: But several of the ones that had no MAMFA
attacking them actually produced lactones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you transplant one region to another?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long would it take for the plants to
switch their little options?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they have enough standing
variation in each population that the
[SPEAKER_04]: selection could act pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were really sensitive to the problem of
not going to the populations that make
[SPEAKER_04]: linalol and turning it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be the in Baldwin way
to do it, is to use gene silencing or to
[SPEAKER_04]: breed the few individuals in those
populations that don't make linalol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there could be all kinds of
other things that are coming along with
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really do want a rill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would take a decade to make rills with
these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a reciprocal transplant would be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ethically, you would want to
remove the pollen, I would guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you certainly could look at MAMFA
attack on plants from the prairie that
[SPEAKER_04]: were grown in Colorado Springs for plants
from the Colorado Springs that were being
[SPEAKER_04]: grown out in the prairie.
[SPEAKER_04]: To water them every day would not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a harsh, harsh place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sol and I went to work there this spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was an unbelievable drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were no bees, just a few plants
blooming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the fate of the West at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And prairie Colorado, it is becoming the
Chihuahuan Desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are aware of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to do reciprocal transplants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been a really nice
experiment to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a nice talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, what about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the graphs that you showed,
they quant a map of linalol versus other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't indicate the actual
quantity of linalol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pie charts are crude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the publication that we're about to
submit, we quantify.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we do is we always have an
internal standard in our chromatography
[SPEAKER_04]: just to make sure that we haven't injected
the wrong amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we run external standard curves
for all the major volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we quantitate them independently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in mass spectrometry, you have
really different response factors to the
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 electron volts ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Energy, rather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we quantitate them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try to eschew percent of total.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to actually present nanograms or
micrograms per flower, per hour,
[SPEAKER_04]: or per gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or gram of flower per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a lot of variation in the actual
amount?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking about linalol
potentially having a different effect in
[SPEAKER_01]: different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dose often makes the toxin or the
attractant in chemical ecology.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we found is that there are plasticity
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we grow the plants from Florence,
which make huge peaks, in our greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: with no UV, those peaks fall fourfold in
peak area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were conservative.
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of linalol that we added in the
field was the greenhouse amount and not
[SPEAKER_04]: the field amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were worried if we added too much
linalol, we'd have some artifact of
[SPEAKER_04]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually chose, we'd lucked into
actually an amount that we could add in
[SPEAKER_04]: the evening that constituted a
conservative test.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's an important question.
[SPEAKER_04]: In chemical ecology, you have to be very
careful, which is why expressing an
[SPEAKER_04]: transgene in a plant with an appropriate
amount of regulation could get you the
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a transcriptomic study,
which I didn't show here, looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: expression in the plant.
We have a lot of candidates for linalol.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of candidates for stamen,
stigma, petals, buds, leaves, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have all kinds of candidates for an
R minus linalol synthase from this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves don't emit very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some screaming candidates in
leaves, but we don't get a lot of head
[SPEAKER_04]: space coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other plants do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working with jewelweed right now,
which makes linalol in its leaves and not
[SPEAKER_04]: so much in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this species, the petals are the
source of linalol.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nectar tubes are nine centimeters
long, and there's methylbenzoate in the
[SPEAKER_04]: nectar, but there's no linalol in the
nectar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really separate functional parts
of the flower because of that distance of
[SPEAKER_04]: the high pantheon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that linalol production is
highly influenced by environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: as shown by greenhouse plants producing
much lower amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you show this map of linalol variation
in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you consider factors such as
environment, UV radiation, and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like levels?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the linalol producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the linalol non-producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is annual average high temperatures
across, I guess we have three or four
[SPEAKER_04]: populations of each.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get weather for all of them
because some of them are literally in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But precipitation, there's no pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature, there's no pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter precipitation, there's no pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also looked at a principal components
analysis of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow in silt, really fine grains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we looked at all kinds of
macronutrients and micronutrients and
[SPEAKER_04]: particle size.
[SPEAKER_04]: No clear explanation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any change in altitude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Florence and Pueblo, Colorado are coming
up off the prairie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs is 7,000 feet up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's higher than Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas out in the prairie, it's like 800
or 900 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a considerable drop in
elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my thought was that could sort of
explain it because a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses have lower production of
secondary metabolites because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: receiving different UV radiations because
of the coatings on greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have difference in elevation,
you have difference in atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of UV out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's fascinating is that all the other
scent compounds don't change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Linalol seems to be the one that responds
to UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should write a grant for UV lamps.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
