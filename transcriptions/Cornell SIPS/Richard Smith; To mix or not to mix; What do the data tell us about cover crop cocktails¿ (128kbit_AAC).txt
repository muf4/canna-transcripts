[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a, I would say a slightly less
sophisticated approach to this general
[SPEAKER_00]: question than Charlie took.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to tell you that cover
crop mixtures or cocktails are a hot topic
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the news, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing cover crop crops can help your
corn grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixes are revving up no-till systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixes in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa farmers are using mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we think that mixtures of cover
crops are better than planting the best
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cover crop in a monoculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested in this question about
why we're using cover crops in general and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, the National Cover Crop
Survey just came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really nice source of
information about why folks are using
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops and mixtures as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this, the overwhelming,
or I'd say the primary reason that folks
[SPEAKER_00]: are thinking about cover crops in general
is for improvements in soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 86% of the respondents of this survey,
of which about 2,000 folks or so took it,
[SPEAKER_00]: either agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement that using cover crops has
[SPEAKER_00]: improved the health of my soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's far and away the most popular
answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the perception is that
these cover crops are making substantive
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements in soil health within the
first year that these cover crops are
[SPEAKER_00]: being implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 54% saw benefits in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are also using cover crops for weed
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell you this necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, 69% of folks indicated that
they always, or at least sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: see improved suppression of
herbicide-resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found particularly interesting
is when asked to list the most
[SPEAKER_00]: weed-suppressive cover crop, the majority
indicated cover crop mixtures,
[SPEAKER_00]: even more so than things like cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks are using cover crop mixtures for
weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using them for soil health
benefits, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks are using mixtures,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the respondents to this question,
do you use cover crop mixes, only 24%
[SPEAKER_00]: stated that they are not using cover crop
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks are using mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks are using really
diverse mixtures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of mixtures that are going
into the ground contain three or more
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, seven, eight,
nine or more species in these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these mixtures are being planted
across a lot of acres, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three-way and the four-plus species
mixtures are being planted on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is, is there a
benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a benefit to using these
high-diversity mixtures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are planting them for perceived soil
health improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: These improvements appear to be taking
place within the first year of using cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these cover crops are being
planted as mixtures, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: high-diversity mixtures, and across a lot
of acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Charlie mentioned, in his talk,
the expectations are that more should be
[SPEAKER_00]: better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that species differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: They differ in a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They differ in root architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They differ in leaf angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They differ in how they acquire soil
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: They differ in how they assimilate those
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species differ, and we think that by
planting more of those different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we should have some substantive
benefit to the soil biology, to resource
[SPEAKER_00]: use efficiency, to productivity,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw this graphic just a short
while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is ecological theory and empirical
evidence that, yeah, we do see a benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant communities when we increase the
diversity of those communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there should be this relationship
between the number of species and
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, biomass should increase as
we increase the number of species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and resource use should become more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be fewer resources left
unused as the number of species increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say that a lot of this work
has been done in perennial systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-agricultural plant communities,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen evidence in those systems
that support these theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that farmers are interested in
cover crop mixtures, mainly to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: soil quality, soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed suppression is another perceived
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's relatively little scientific
evidence to support the purported benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of mixing cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly due to a lack of
research with cover crops, though I will
[SPEAKER_00]: say that there's been quite a bit of
research very recently around this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there are theoretical and
empirical support for this plant diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem function relationship that
suggests that productivity and resource
[SPEAKER_00]: use should increase with increasing plant
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diverse plant communities should be more
resistant to invasion because resources
[SPEAKER_00]: are being used more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, there's fewer resources left
for weeds or invading plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's been a lack of relevant
research in the context of annual cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that as the context,
I want to tell you about some research
[SPEAKER_00]: that we conducted in New Hampshire aimed
at getting at some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some very kind of
straightforward questions that we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask and answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do cover crop mixtures produce more cover
crop biomass than monocultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do mixtures suppress weeds better than
monocultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do we see a benefit of the
mixtures to the subsequent crop that you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant after those, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where the rubber hits
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the questions we were trying
to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the experiment involved three
groups of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those groups here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into them too much other than
to say that two of the groups included
[SPEAKER_00]: non-legume forbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the groups included three or four
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the groups included a legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these groups were intended to target
biomass production at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this first group was targeting high
summer biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next group was targeting high fall
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were targeting high spring
biomass with the third group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for all intents and purposes,
we can think of these as three separate
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments involving different suites of
cover crops planted at different times of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for each of these experiments,
we planted all of those species within a
[SPEAKER_00]: group as a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all monocultures were represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had a treatment that was a mixture
of all of those species in that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So experiment one, we had a six-way
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that mixture, every species was
planted at 1 sixth of the seeding rate
[SPEAKER_00]: that the monocultures were planted at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had a 14-way mixture that included
all 14 distinct cover crop species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also included a control where we
did not plant a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for experiment two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for experiment three,
again, all monocultures, but we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: five-way mixture because we only had five
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, that five-way mixture was
planted at 1 fifth of the seeding rate for
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the five species in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three experiments just to
see what happens when we do not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop, just a comparison without a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say this was all done at our
research farm in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds were drilled with a small plot
drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no weed control of any sort
for the duration of the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the crop growth period for each
of these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that growth period,
we measured cover crop biomass and the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass of any weeds that were present at
the time that we harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tilled all of the plots under
carefully, so incorporated the residues,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then relocated the plots and planted a
test crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically telling this test crop
to tell us how these cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if they improve soil health,
then we should see that in the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: performance in this test crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each test crop was a biculture that
contained two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two species differed depending
on the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always a grass paired with a
non-legume forb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always two species that
differed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not occur in the original
experiment plots just to guard against
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup of pathogens or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the test crop was grown for a
period of time, sometimes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and then into the subsequent
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that growth period,
we again harvested for the test crop
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass and then any weeds that were
present as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's basically the setup of the
experiment, the experiments in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer these questions, do the
mixtures produce more cover crop biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: than the monocultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the results from experiment one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just showing the spread of the
data for each of the cover crops grown as
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that some did pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize that these are all in
metric units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some did not do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the legume, the chickling
vetch, didn't do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily surprising in
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's take a look at the six-way
and the 14-way mixtures, how they do
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they didn't do too
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the six-way and the 14-way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did better than some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were comparable to our best
performing species in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the six-way was actually statistically
equivalent to the millet and the oats and
[SPEAKER_00]: the buckwheat monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they certainly didn't do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't produce more biomass than the
highest producing species grown as
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's experiment two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have quite a spread depending on
the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the monocultures, again, the legume
had produced the lowest amount of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oats and wheat produced the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where the mixtures fell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they did OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly did better than some of the
monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, the six-way was statistically
equivalent to the triticale oats and wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they didn't do better than the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less producing monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did better than some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as well as others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the five-way did just as well as the
wheat, the cereal rye, and the triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 14-way usually did less well in terms
of biomass production than the five-way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just adding more species doesn't
necessarily give you better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that Charlie made a
really nice point of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at total biomass is one way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to look at the performance is
to use something like the land equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into it other than to say it
basically provides a way of assessing
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the mixtures performed better than
you would expect based on how the
[SPEAKER_00]: component species in that mixture
performed in the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if this LER value is equal to one,
it's basically telling you that that
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture did exactly what you would expect
based on how the monocultures did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's anything less than one,
that mixture actually did worse than you
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something about that
combination of species that prevents them
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as they otherwise would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's anything above one,
then that's telling you that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better than you would actually
expect based on what is in that mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: and how each of those components did in
the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something good happening in
that mixture, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we calculated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the results indicated by
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red dots are for the six and the
five-way mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue dots are for the 14-way
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what this is telling us is
that those 14-way mixtures are doing about
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as you would expect based on
what's in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the six and five ways are actually
doing better than we would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some good things happening in
those mixtures that suggest that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using resources more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're using resources more
efficiently, then maybe they're
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing weeds better than we might
expect or better than the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads us into question number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the mixtures suppress weeds better than
the monocultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the results for experiment one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the white bar there is the
weedy fallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us how many weeds we had in
the absence of any cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a lot of the cover crops,
particularly buckwheat, oats, and millet,
[SPEAKER_00]: really suppressed weeds very well as
monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chickling, vetch, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes sense given it didn't
produce a whole lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did the mixtures do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the mixtures did pretty well in
terms of weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did just as well statistically as the
buckwheat, which was our most suppressive
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop grown as monoculture,
and the oats and the millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't do better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with experiment number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, forage radish was our most
weed suppressive followed by wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mixtures suppressed weeds as well
as the forage radish and the wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get better than almost
complete suppression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an unfair comparison,
but they did just as well as our most
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressive cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, all of the cover crops grown
as monocultures or as mixtures were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much equally suppressive, and they were
marginally suppressive, all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were all pretty comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the mixtures were not more weed
suppressive than our most weed suppressive
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that brings us to the last
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do mixtures and monocultures affect
the growth of a pest crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the question that I was most
interested in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is integrating across a lot of
potential functions to influence the next
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the next crop respond to these
mixtures?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we probably care about
most, particularly farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this influencing my cash crop
potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the results for the first
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, so this is canola and wheat
biomass, total biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we separated them out, but this is just
total test crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that biomass of the test crop
was not too bad following the weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: fallow, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quite low following oats and
sorghum, and it was highest following
[SPEAKER_00]: buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buckwheat monoculture resulted in the
highest test crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of our mixtures resulted in lower
test crop biomass, lower test crop
[SPEAKER_00]: performance compared to when that followed
buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed biomass, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say upwards of eight or nine,
but dominated by two or three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those data for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't pull them up off the top of my
head, but a lot of lamb's quarter and
[SPEAKER_00]: pigweed and maybe some crabgrass is kind
of the dominant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's experiment two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, forage radish monoculture
resulted in the highest test crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our six-way was lower than forage radish
in terms of the resulting test crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the 14-way actually was statistically
similar to that forage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, nothing higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the best performing monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cases lower, but often similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last experiment, experiment number three,
hairy vetch resulted in the highest test
[SPEAKER_00]: crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, both of the mixtures
resulted in test crop biomass that was
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than when it followed hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to put this into some
context, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one experiment, well,
three experiments at one site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did kind of a, I came up with
this great idea to do a quick literature
[SPEAKER_00]: review yesterday or day before yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have a whole lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not an exhaustive review of the
literature, but I'd certainly been to
[SPEAKER_00]: enough scientific meetings in the past
couple of years where I was hearing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kinds of results being presented that
the mixtures, not necessarily a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: worse than the monocultures, but not a
whole lot of evidence that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: having a whole lot of benefits beyond what
we are seeing in the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I pulled out these sets of studies
that I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find, there's actually been quite
a few of these types of studies reported
[SPEAKER_00]: in the literature very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been, like I said, it's been a
pretty hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of went through the three
functions that I was interested in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, cover crop biomass, weed
suppression, and then this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: carryover effect to the next crop,
and kind of ranked the performance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture relative to the best performing
monoculture, which is kind of how I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in most cases,
not everybody measured everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but usually the result was that cover
crop, in terms of biomass, it was either
[SPEAKER_00]: equal or less than the best performing
monoculture in that particular study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was by far the overwhelming results
in at least this set of studies that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could really only find one study
that reported anything suggestive of
[SPEAKER_00]: greater benefit, in this case,
in terms of cover crop biomass in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture compared to the best performing
monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the results that we're
reporting here in our study are in line
[SPEAKER_00]: with what a number of other folks are
reporting in similar types of studies all
[SPEAKER_00]: across the United States and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of wrap it up and
summarize, we found no evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures were more productive than the
most productive cover crop grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: No evidence that mixtures suppress weeds
better than the most suppressive cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop grown in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found no evidence that mixtures
improved the soil, and I put that in
[SPEAKER_00]: quotes, it's not necessarily soil health
per se, for the growth of a subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: test crop by the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found no evidence that mixtures hurt,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few cases where things were
substantially lower with the mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixtures may be a good bet hedging
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, given what Charlie just
reported, you know, it really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, begs for us to think about a more
nuanced view of how we construct these
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures from a more functional
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, mixtures may have other
benefits that we did not measure in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to poo poo mixtures,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have just, the data that we have
collected and that others have collected
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that we might want to take a more
nuanced view of mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, more work in this area is
needed and is being done, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'll acknowledge the
assistance and our funding, and if I have
[SPEAKER_00]: any time for questions, I'd be happy to
answer those.
Brandon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two questions before comments,
rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is that this was just a one year
study, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I reported one year of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have three years of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I'm going to work on
during my sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually quite a bit of data
from this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually harvested biomass at three
times during the sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that growth period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some more fine scale data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I presented kind of the last harvest set
of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we have some more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know what they tell us yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the future analysis would be
kind of coupling what you're doing with
[SPEAKER_03]: measurements for microbial diversity and
total microbial biomass would seem to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conceptually, that's why a lot of people
are planting mixtures, in my mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: is microbial biomass diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the third question I just had
was, in one of the studies where Vetch,
[SPEAKER_03]: your phytonic, did extremely well after
Vetch, Vetch was the only legume in that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular set of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly a nitrogen benefit there
could be other things happening as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Vetch was also in the
mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Paul probably has a comment that I
would make.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you separate the biomass for each of
the components, and were they equally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you divide them in one sixth,
and I kind of doubt that they were equally
[SPEAKER_01]: represented when they were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeding rate for each species was
cut by one sixth, or one sixth the seeding
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the proportions of each one would
be, they were seeded that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually came up, like what Charlie
showed, what you plant doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: dictate what's going to come up and the
competition and how that's going to play
[SPEAKER_00]: out over the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did separate out each so we can look
at how much Vetch was actually in that
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture, how much buckwheat was in the
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have not done that yet, but that's all
things that I want to do over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each species was sown in the mixture at
one sixth of their monoculture rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the monoculture rate was the
recommended seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vetch said, well it's also Paul's
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he just said that he hadn't looked
at the data quite yet, but certainly you
[SPEAKER_02]: went out to the field, and you must have
seen like, wow, there are a lot of grasses
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up versus these smaller legumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were your observations there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what was the difference between
the sixth species mixture and the 14th?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see more inventiveness?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the answer to your second
question, but I will know that when I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to dig through the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observations, looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there were species within a
given mixture that seemed to dominate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, without looking at the data,
the dry weight data, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I looked at them with my
eyeballs, the mixtures looked pretty darn
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, oh, it's all ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each species that we planned was present,
and it was present pretty decently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, until I look at those data,
can't give you the most informed answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should hold questions here and
let the next presenter get on with their
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, Rich, for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
