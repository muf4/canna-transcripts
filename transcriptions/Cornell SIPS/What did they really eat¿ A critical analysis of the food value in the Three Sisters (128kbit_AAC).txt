[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much, Don,
for that nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this afternoon, I am going to go back
to Haudenosaunee territory and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the Three Sisters as a cropping system
well known with the Iroquois.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a cropping system not only
present here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a cropping system all over the
Western Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Carl Sawyer wrote in 1962,
it's a symbiotic plant complex of North
[SPEAKER_01]: America without an equal elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Iroquois, William Fenton has
indicated that it is the foundation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Iroquois subsistence, enabling them to
develop institutions of sedentary life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Three Sisters, in terms of their
origins in the Northeast, until quite
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, most archaeologists and
anthropologists thought that these three
[SPEAKER_01]: crops arrived in the Northeast as an
intact cropping system and that they came
[SPEAKER_01]: here sometime between 1,000 and 1,200 B.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recent work by the paleobotanist John
Hart who works at the New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: Museum at Albany has put forth a much
different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, edible squash has been around here
since 3,000 B.P., maize by 2,270 B.P.,
[SPEAKER_01]: and beans, a much more recent
introduction, 700 B.P., or just in the
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of hundred years before Europeans
arrived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hart says that the three plants as a
crop complex were not all here at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time until around 700 B.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use what they use, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Three Sisters in Iroquois or in
Haudenosaunee territories have been
[SPEAKER_01]: central to our cultural identity in our
oral text, such as the creation story,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the words that come before all else,
in all aspects of social and political
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions, and in subsistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, women were the farmers in
Iroquois, and women controlled most
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of agricultural work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the top right, you see a watercolor
painting by Ernie Smith, a Seneca artist
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 1930s, portraying a very typical
Iroquoian view of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're portrayed as members of a family,
as women, and the difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and the human beings is not
discernible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see another painting below by
Ernie Smith showing, this one was called
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn Gatherers, another one of his
paintings showing women bringing corn in
[SPEAKER_01]: from the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the drawing on the left was by a
Jesuit up in the 1600s who was along the
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Lawrence with Iroquoian villages and
farmers up there, and this was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: drawings that he made of women working in
the field with handheld hoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the agronomic characteristics
of the Three Sisters, they're typically
[SPEAKER_01]: planted on mounds, and this is,
you see there is a photo from early 1900s
[SPEAKER_01]: in eastern, in western Iroquois,
Massachusetts, and this was thought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: an old Indian planting field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crops were usually planted as a
polyculture, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are indications that there were
sometimes corn monocultures or bean
[SPEAKER_01]: monocultures, and sometimes I think even
pumpkin monocultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no plows in this cropping
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hand tools only.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was continuously cropped, meaning this
was a permanent agriculture, not shifting
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary reason for that is where most
of this agriculture was taking place,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is along the center of New York
State, present day New York State,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a band of alphasols,
which are highly fertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where most of our best agriculture
is even now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the continuously cropped means that
these were on very highly productive
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think about shifting cultivation,
that is a management strategy for acid in
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile soils, and so not applicable here
at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the agricultural productivity
of this system, historic records provide a
[SPEAKER_01]: very extensive record of firsthand
observations that date all the way back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the 1680s, even earlier, indicating
that New York corn agriculture was highly
[SPEAKER_01]: productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were amazed at the types of crops
that they were seeing, but no one took any
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have no measures of corn,
bushels of corn per acre, which as an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural scientist, that's what I'm
always interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the middle 1990s, decided to do
some field research and to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we carried out some experiments at the
Musgrave Research Farm up in Keyuga
[SPEAKER_01]: County, and on a private farm in Tompkins
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as we could, we used crop
varieties and agronomic practices similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to what the Iroquois would have used in
the 17th and 18th centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you some quick crop
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was at Tompkins County, averaged over
two years, and these are the three
[SPEAKER_01]: sisters, meaning the, wrong way,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, not liking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the three sisters,
the crops, corn, beans, and squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: corn and green, bean and orange and
pumpkin, yellow, corn by itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: bean by itself, and pumpkin by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what happened in Tompkins County
over two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Keyuga County, it looked quite a bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three sisters, almost no beans or
pumpkin, higher yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn monoculture, about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bean monoculture, pretty dreadful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pumpkin monoculture, equally dreadful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What agronomists do, one of the problems
with yields like this, trying to compare
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin with corn, is you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what agronomists do, we use something
called land equivalency ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we simply look at the
ratio of each one of the crops in the
[SPEAKER_01]: polyculture and compare it to when it was
grown in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, the corn yield in Tompkins
County in 1993 was 1874 in the three
[SPEAKER_01]: sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 2231 when it was grown as a
monoculture, meaning that we basically got
[SPEAKER_01]: 82% of the yield in the three sisters
compared to when it was grown as a
[SPEAKER_01]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go down and do the same thing for
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: 132 in the three sisters versus 1096,
we only got 12% of the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the pumpkins, 14,465 to over
40,000, we got about a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is we add up those ratios and
we get a number, 1.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the land equivalency ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any time the number is over one,
what intercropping people say is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was an advantage to have planted it as a
polyculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the number is less than one,
it says you should have stuck with
[SPEAKER_01]: monocultures, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can look at Tompkins 1994,
1.08, Kiyuga 1997, 1.16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of the polyculture intercropping
literature will show results like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: although sometimes the yields are less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get LERs less than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this particular example,
they're all over one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've just been talking about
crop yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the title is what did they eat,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm interested in food values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm focusing on two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy and protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for this is that
subsistence farmers will first ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can actually feed their families,
that families won't starve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they do is they look to
produce energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their next priority after they're making
sure people aren't starving is to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of the diet by adding protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a consequence of this, most
subsistence farmers will plant a grain
[SPEAKER_01]: like wheat or maize, rice for energy,
calories, and a legume like bean,
[SPEAKER_01]: pea, or lentils in order to add protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm back to this question again
because before we go any further,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to be clear about what we're
talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they really eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've given lots and lots of workshops
to little fourth graders all around
[SPEAKER_01]: Tompkins County with my kids and then with
lots of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about those kids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost every time after we do a
workshop on the Three Sisters,
[SPEAKER_01]: some little kid will come up and grab my
arm and say, but what did they really eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're thinking corn,
sweet corn, and green beans, and pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to imagine making a real
meal out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always the question, what did they
really eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is confusing because corn,
we can harvest it when it's immature,
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice the stalks are green,
the husks are green, and if you pull back
[SPEAKER_01]: the husk, that kernel is going,
if you pinch it, it will squirt milk into
[SPEAKER_01]: your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call this sweet corn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one way, corn, zea maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have zea maize that lives and
looks like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is mature corn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice it's brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stems are brown, the leaves are brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice the ears, the husks are brown,
and notice how different the kernels look,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is green corn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do the same thing for beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is phasiolus vulgaris, a kidney bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can harvest it when it's immature,
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are green, the pods are green,
slice open the pod, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a little tiny seed in there,
but we're eating that whole pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could leave the plant in the field,
let it fully mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice everything's turning brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we harvest a pod, but we take out the
seeds inside there and we eat those.
[SPEAKER_01]: No longer interested in that pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has major effects on the nutrient
content of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we harvest maize as sweet corn,
75% of it is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 86 calories and 3 grams of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we wait and harvest it as mature
grain, it's only 10% water, 3,650 calories
[SPEAKER_01]: and 9 grams of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with green bean is even more
striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest it when it's green, 90% of it is
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% water, 31 calories, 2 grams of
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until it's mature, we call it a
kidney bean, 12% water, 3370 calories and
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 grams of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can guess, if you're a subsistence
farmer, when you're gonna harvest your
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predominantly, particularly if you're
worried, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be harvesting mature grain
and mature beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So corn grain and dried beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but now we wanna go from a crop
yield to a food yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out this is a fairly
complicated process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm bringing back this data from the
field experiments, but now I've averaged
[SPEAKER_01]: over sites and over years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at crop weights at
harvest weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not dry weights, more or less at harvest
weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the maize is at 10% water,
the beans at 12%, pumpkin flesh at 90%,
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin seed at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice here now, I've divided the pumpkin
into the flesh and the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if we look at these crop weights at
harvest, we see the three sisters,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are just weights over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at this pumpkin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're just thinking about
weight, you'd say, well, we should just go
[SPEAKER_01]: with the pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more of that than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that most of that
pumpkin is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And water has neither calories nor
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're interested in its food value,
we've got to figure out a way to get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of the water and compare it more fairly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we convert the harvest weight to energy
and protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ways that we do this is we look at
the USDA nutritional database,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gives us the amount of calories
[SPEAKER_01]: in maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when it has 10% water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got maize, 3650 calories per
kilogram, and 94 grams of protein per
[SPEAKER_01]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bean, very similar to maize, but a lot
more protein, about the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: water, pumpkin flesh, only 260 calories,
10 grams of protein, and an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumpkin seed, whoa, 5,590 calories,
302 grams of protein, and only five of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we're beginning to see some
differences in how we might begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare these different systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this graph, what I'm showing is the
three sisters here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the total calories coming from
maize, the bean, pumpkin seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pumpkin flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice the amount of energy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually more than what we get from
maize monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way more than we get from bean
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot more than what we get from
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But note also that a huge amount of the
pumpkin calories is coming from the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you might want to remember the land
equivalency ratio and how that,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with just the weights, showed us that
even with the three sisters, we got an
[SPEAKER_01]: L-E-R of slightly over one compared to the
corn monoculture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that we can do better,
and the energy reflects that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just brought this up to show you and
remind you again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do the same thing with protein,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one, we're looking at protein in
the three sisters, in maize monoculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: in bean monoculture, and in pumpkin
monoculture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice the significant contribution
from the beans and the pumpkin both flesh
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice that it is now quite a bit
higher than maize monoculture and still
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than the bean and still higher than
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many of you are saying, but wait a
minute, plant proteins are incomplete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, how can you really be measuring
the proteins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know that plants don't provide
all of the essential amino acids that we
[SPEAKER_01]: need, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have different amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the maize, the bean,
the pumpkin seed, and I've put pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: flesh up here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we will notice is that four of
these, isoleucine, lysine, 309,
[SPEAKER_01]: and tryptophan, corn in particular is low
in these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bean nicely complements where the
maize is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly, the pumpkin seeds are
really strong in some of those areas as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably asking, but these numbers
on the pumpkin flesh, they're so small,
[SPEAKER_01]: why do you even include them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of pumpkin flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you add up all of those amino
acids, they can complement the amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: in the other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be from other plant foods or from
other foods, whether it's fish or nuts or
[SPEAKER_01]: deer, they can be part of the protein
contribution even though the concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: is so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also interested in looking at
calcium, vitamins A and C, and niacin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these again are taken from the USDA,
nutrient database.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see down at the bottom is a
recommended daily allowance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, for calcium, we need
1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look here, we see we're now
looking so good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very good numbers here for any of
these foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at vitamin A, maize and beans
are dreadful, but pumpkin flesh,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoa, we need 5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get 8,500 in 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin A is not going to be a problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin C, however, we need 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pretty low, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And niacin, we need 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this doesn't look so great either,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back and talk a little bit more
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wonderful word, nixtamalization,
it's a word that means it's a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing corn, corn grain, that it is
soaked and usually cooked in an alkaline
[SPEAKER_01]: water, a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Iroquoia, we cook it in hardwood ash,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nixtamalization does a number of really
neat things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first thing is it dramatically
reduces cooking time because the alkaline
[SPEAKER_01]: solution attacks the pericarp of maize,
which is very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it begins to hydrolyze it so that
water can get in much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it dramatically reduces cooking
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that nixtamalization
does, all of those ashes have lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is the calcium gets
attracted to maize starch grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the calcium content of the corn or
the maize increases 100% to 400%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nixtamalization also improves protein
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the amino acids, and I showed you
a bunch of them, that corn was really
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's lysine, tryptophan, histidine,
methionine, and threonine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it increases the relative amounts of
these amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end result is it makes corn a
higher quality protein, meaning it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have, yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly the same, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a difference in what you're
doing, what you're using to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we nixtamalize corn, we actually
improve its protein quality because we
[SPEAKER_01]: balance out some of the, or we increase
the amounts of some of those amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also has another impact in that it
increases niacin, which is part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin B complex, preventing pellagra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pellagra is a really ugly, terrible,
terrible disease that was rampant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still widespread in parts of Africa
and Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from primarily a diet that is
almost exclusively corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with the corn is that it's
low in tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tryptophan is a precursor to forming
niacin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you nixtamalize, you increase the
tryptophan, and that increases the niacin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before colonization, there was not a
single documented case of pellagra in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Western Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only after that pellagra came.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much of it has to do with the process
of nixtamalization because when the poor
[SPEAKER_01]: folks in the Southeast United States were
eating corn, they were mostly just
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding it and not nixtamalizing it
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were so poor, they had no beans
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing is true in parts of
Africa and Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a disease of poor people who do
not have the technology, the
[SPEAKER_01]: nixtamalization, or any kind of legume in
order to increase the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we've talked about all these
comparisons, and I've told you how
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful the Three Sisters is compared to
the monocultures of maize and bean and
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin, although I'm sure many of you are
noting this maize monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both energy and protein, maize is
amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maize out yields every other grain crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Margaret Smith here is nodding away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I've been comparing the Three
Sisters with a maize monoculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bean monoculture, and a pumpkin
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I am implying is Iroquois farmers
would choose to plant the Three Sisters,
[SPEAKER_01]: or no, we're not going to plant our field
to the Three Sisters this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to plant a bean monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a choice between planting your
field to the Three Sisters or deciding
[SPEAKER_01]: just to plant pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they know that's not going to
work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't make any sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to decide between three
crops and one crop for your entire field,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, you're going to take your field,
and I couldn't make this into a square,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretend that the field is a circle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of planting the Three Sisters,
we might decide to plant one third of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field to corn, one third to beans,
and one third to pumpkin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having the Three Sisters
over the entire field, we divide it into
[SPEAKER_01]: three parts and put one crop here,
but it's still on the same field,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, let's say, one hectare,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one third of the hectare is corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: One third is bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: One third is squash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could decide, seeing how productive
the corn is, I'm going to put half of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: half of the field into corn, and I'm going
to put 25% into bean and 25% into pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I really say, that corn is looking
awfully good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put 80% of the field into
corn and only 10% into bean and pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a much more realistic comparison
of what people would actually choose,
[SPEAKER_01]: the decisions that farmers are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's look at monoculture mixtures
versus the Three Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first one, and we're looking at
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first one says we've got a third,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a third of these crops,
and this is how much each one of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: the maize, bean, and pumpkin, contribute
to the total energy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking not so great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the one that's 50% corn and
then 25% and 25% bean and pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see we're doing better,
but it's still not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we put 80% into corn, we're doing
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we plant the whole field to corn,
we're even better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget the pumpkin and the squash and the
beans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plant corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now look at the Three Sisters,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we plant the corn and we add the bean
and pumpkin, we get a jump in the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the land equivalency ratio that we
saw in the yield as well, but we see it in
[SPEAKER_01]: energy too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that, yeah, there's a good reason
why these farmers are planting the Three
[SPEAKER_01]: Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it turns out that we get more
energy from this than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at the same thing in terms of
protein, but it looks different,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we look at the one-third,
one-third, one-third, and we can see we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting about a third from maize,
a little bit more than a third from the
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin, and something less than that from
the beans, but the total amount is still
[SPEAKER_01]: less than what we get from the Three
Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we increase the amount of
corn, we increase the amount of protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up and we get right up to there
when we go all corn, but notice the
[SPEAKER_01]: significant impact of the Three Sisters on
increasing protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would argue that this is the major
advantage of the Three Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much in terms of energy,
it does give extra energy, but it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these are on the same piece of
land, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've just varied, whether it's Three
Sisters or the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, oh, the mixture, I mean,
these are all, this is, it's the standard
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're asking what portion of this,
most of the yield is coming from the corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's protein or energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is that this is on one piece
of land, so exactly where it comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you plant three kernels of corn in
a hill and two or three of beans,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you plant the pumpkin in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're interested in is what comes
out, right, of what the yield is in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of energy and protein, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm interested in is, well,
how many people, and I'll tell you how I
[SPEAKER_01]: got started on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got called by the Museum of the American
Indian in New York City, the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Museum, but not the one in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's other site in New York City,
and they are doing a program, educational
[SPEAKER_01]: program on the Three Sisters, and they
wanted to have a cropping game in which
[SPEAKER_01]: young kids and their families would plant
different amounts, either as polycultures
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Three Sisters or as monocultures,
and they wanted to make it real,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they said, well, how many people could
it feed, you know, like an acre of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Sisters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, well, I'll have to do some
calculations, and I did some quick
[SPEAKER_01]: back-of-the-envelope calculations,
and I realized it was a very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: question about how many people could
actually eat off of a hectare of the Three
[SPEAKER_01]: Sisters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to make this kind of
calculation, you first have to determine,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what are the daily requirements of
an active adult for energy?
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, how many calories do we
need, and what about protein?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a daily basis, 2,500 calories per
day is pretty realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 grams of protein, realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just multiply by 365, and you come up
with what one person would need for a
[SPEAKER_01]: year, close to a million calories,
right, to provide basics, and 22 kilograms
[SPEAKER_01]: of protein, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just go back to the data that I
just showed you and kind of divide it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people supported by monoculture
mixtures, the ones I was showing you
[SPEAKER_01]: before, and the Three Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the energy is in the lighter
kind of tan, and the protein is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: darker color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see is that on everything in a
third, we're able to feed probably seven
[SPEAKER_01]: people per hectare in terms of energy,
supply that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of protein, we get over 10,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice that as each time the corn goes up,
each of these numbers increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up to, without with the
monoculture of corn, we're up to about 12
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half people fed per hectare in terms
of energy, and about 13 and a half in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, the Three Sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of energy, we could supply for
about 13 people, and in terms of protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 15 and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for comparison, to think about it,
and I have these figures and could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do it, but I didn't think I would
have time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we looked at European wheat growers,
in the same time period, wheat farmers in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe were struggling to feed even three
or four people per hectare, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we see here is a cropping
system that is multiple times more
[SPEAKER_01]: productive and able to support more
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so what are the conclusions
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, that intercropped maize bean and
pumpkin is highly productive, and it
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly could have been counted on to
largely satisfy Haudenosaunee dietary
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no indication that they used
only these crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, many, many other sources of food
in this area, very, very productive
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem with all sorts of other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wild plants, lots of animals and
fish, but certainly as the foundation for
[SPEAKER_01]: their diet, it was doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons for this is maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the anchor of the system,
and with its very high crop yields,
[SPEAKER_01]: it produces really enormous amounts of
energy and a lot of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Three Sisters, as a cropping system,
provides more energy and protein than
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are individual crop monocultures and
more than monoculture mixtures of these
[SPEAKER_01]: three crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumpkin and the bean and pumpkin seeds
increase the total amounts of protein and
[SPEAKER_01]: improve protein quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumpkin flesh provides lots of vitamin
A, and maize nixtamalization decreases
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking time, increases calcium 100 to 400
percent, improves protein quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: and increases niacin, preventing
polygrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking at how many people we can
support, Three Sisters, and I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify this, these are based on yields
from field experiments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amounts, the maize yields,
I am absolutely confident in.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very realistic maize yields in
either the polyculture or when planted as
[SPEAKER_01]: a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very realistic yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beans and the pumpkin much less
experience in only a couple of sites and
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have much less confidence in the
beans and pumpkin, but it's pretty clear
[SPEAKER_01]: to me that even with relatively small
amounts, small yields of beans and
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin, the Three Sisters does a great
job because even those small amounts boost
[SPEAKER_01]: things enough to significantly increase
energy and protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of energy, enough for 13.4
people per hectare per year, and in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of protein, almost 16 people per hectare
per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'm open to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The explanation for the over yielding,
mostly the nitrogen from the beans or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I would say that the
contribution of beans in terms of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cotton system is very minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that people eat
the beans, which are what contains most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are small amounts of nitrogen in the
stems and leaves, but the majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen in the beans is in the bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you eat it, the only way it gets
back onto the field is if you put human
[SPEAKER_01]: waste back on the field, like we do with
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bean contribution is relatively
unimportant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason for the increased
productivity, at least what literature on
[SPEAKER_01]: intercropping tells us, is it's just
increased efficiency of the entire system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the three crops are
collecting more sunlight and more energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gathering more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their roots are gathering more water and
nutrients underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of that, we're seeing
small efficiencies that result in somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: greater yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say anything about how these foods
were prepared and eaten in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: tortillas and lots of different indigenous
practices?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not tortillas.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not tortillas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn and beans, primarily in soup and
in bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person to look for that, two major
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Arthur Parker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iroquois uses it in maize and other food
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his contemporary, waw, W-A-U-G-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just called Iroquois
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those were written in the
early 1900s in the very extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane, the cucurbit that you spoke about
was pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the sole cucurbit type that the
Hon Noshani used?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was indications, particularly at
the time of Sullivan's campaign,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there were lots of different types of
cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cucurbits are a bit of a nightmare in
terms of their complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I barely feel competent to even say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I know is that the one that I am
looking at in the nutrient data that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken from is cucurbita pipo, pipo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark was saying, you've got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are crops that have brightly
colored flesh, quite firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like a pumpkin or what we
would often think about as a winter
[SPEAKER_01]: squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the acorn is in a different place,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though acorn we think of as a winter
squash, the acorn is not pipo,
[SPEAKER_01]: pipo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pipo ova, I think, or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, but there were other cucurbits
that were much more similar to melons and
[SPEAKER_01]: things, maybe even cucumbers, that the
English might have known about because
[SPEAKER_01]: they seemed to, during Sullivan's
campaign, kind of give them names that
[SPEAKER_01]: sounded like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might have been growing lots of
others instead, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I focused on the food value on the
pumpkin or the winter squash because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most nutrient-based.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the process of mixed realization,
I'd expect some nutrients to be lost in
[SPEAKER_03]: the solution, but they're also picking up
calcium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any information of the
changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about mixed realization that I
did learn, which surprised me,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that the total protein actually
decreases on the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total amount of protein of mixed corn
is less than un-mixed corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of that may, I'm not even
sure how that happens, but the protein
[SPEAKER_01]: quality increases substantially,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that more than compensates,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of other things that might be
lost in terms of leaching, I didn't see
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've read a number of papers on mixed
realization, and I don't recall them
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that things were lost other than
protein went down, total protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that K-Mase is originally from
Central America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do squash and beans also come from Central
America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, short answer, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although squash was, domesticated at two
different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Eastern Woodlands, in North
America, and in Central and South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first squashes that were
domesticated were inedible gourds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I understand, the edible squash
comes in quite a bit late.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm not sure of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edible squash may have been only
domesticated in Central America and then
[SPEAKER_01]: moved forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what was domesticated in the
Eastern Woodlands was an inedible gourds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see the Three Sisters elsewhere,
such as in Mexico, with the Aztecs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Carl Sawyer said, it's across the
entire Western Hemisphere, at least up
[SPEAKER_01]: into kind of Southern Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And goes all the way down, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not Peru?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Peru too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they only use two, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time, there are three.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the Three Sisters being grown in the
same place year after year, did that
[SPEAKER_06]: system require fertility additions?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question, and I will send
you an article on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yes, I mean, they were not grown
indefinitely because Iroquoian villages
[SPEAKER_01]: were moved frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the standard kind of
rationale given was that the soils became
[SPEAKER_01]: depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soils did not become depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily because the Iroquois did not use
plows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were starting on very fertile
soils, alpha soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major loss of fertility in
agricultural systems is not from crop
[SPEAKER_01]: lactation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from plowing, which causes oxidation
of nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those nitrates leave the soil
system, only a few are captured by the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plow continuously, which
Europeans and US settlers did for a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of hundred years, you will see a dramatic
decline in soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had always been assumed that the reason
for that was these crops were just
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbing out all of that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major reason for the decline in
fertility was the continuous plowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that the Iroquois were growing
crops, starting with very fertile soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha soils typically will have unplowed
4% to 5% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't plow them, the only thing
that you are losing then is what's taken
[SPEAKER_01]: up by the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small amounts, when you're digging out
there with your hoe, don't get captured.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get captured by the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the decrease in soil organic matter
and in nitrogen is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from what we can see, the Iroquois were
not cutting down trees and looking for new
[SPEAKER_01]: fields every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they had cleared a field and formed
those mountains, they probably stayed
[SPEAKER_01]: there for as long as the village stayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the village moved not because of soil
fertility decline, but because of trade
[SPEAKER_01]: means, of defensive means, of the
longhouse was infested with fleas,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had reasons to move, but it had
nothing to do with declining soil
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about insects and diseases?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they all brought by Europeans or are
there any other major insects and
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly a European form of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a few others would have brought it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm sure that they had diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been maybe a reason for
wanting to move here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my guess is that the squash bugs
will accumulate wherever the squash is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a hard time finding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing that I would think would
be the biggest task would be weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weeds, we could never grow the
Three Sisters at the Musgrave Farm or
[SPEAKER_01]: anyplace else without doing an awful lot
of handweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is because we're using plows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you use plows, you're
constantly bringing up the weed seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: encouraging weeds to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, a lot of the weeds that are
most troublesome now in New York state are
[SPEAKER_01]: imports from Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Jane, for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
