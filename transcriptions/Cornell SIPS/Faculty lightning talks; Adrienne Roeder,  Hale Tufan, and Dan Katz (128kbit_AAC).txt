[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm really fascinated by size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Size is really important and it's deeply
fascinating question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Size is fundamental to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really important for yield,
but size is not trivially important to
[SPEAKER_06]: yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might think we want things to be
bigger, but we only want the right part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant to be bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want the grain, for instance,
or the part of the plant we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: eat to be bigger, but we want the rest of
the plant often to be smaller to fit into
[SPEAKER_06]: more plants into the same field or the
same growing space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you think back to the green
revolution, one of the key things was
[SPEAKER_06]: making smaller plants the bigger grains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here you can see pre-green revolution
is larger plants, smaller grains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Post-green revolution, you've got smaller
plants, bigger grains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to understand size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Breeders are very good at achieving this,
but I think that if we actually understand
[SPEAKER_06]: how size and shape are controlled,
we can do even better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And size is one of the things we really
still don't understand that's so basic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my lab studies this in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like the Arabidopsis sepals and the
leaves for studying this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our sepals are green, outermost floral
organs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They enclose and protect the flower buds,
so they're really defensive organs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the reasons sepals are cool is
that they have this amazing pattern of
[SPEAKER_06]: different cell sizes in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've got these giant cells,
all colored here in red, interspersed
[SPEAKER_06]: between smaller cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another reason we chose sepals is just
that they're on the outside of the flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: so they're really accessible for imaging
and manipulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another reason is that there's four sepals
in each Arabidopsis flower, so we can look
[SPEAKER_06]: at their size within a flower and say,
are all the sepals the same size or not?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's actually important for their
function.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sepals need to be the same size to
keep that flower bud close and keep all
[SPEAKER_06]: the environment, insects, everything out
while the reproductive organs are
[SPEAKER_06]: developing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sepals are a great model system.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've now gone on to leaves, which are
totally not a great model system,
[SPEAKER_06]: but a lot of people care about leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sepals are like little leaves,
so that makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so what we love to do in the lab is
actually image the plants as they're
[SPEAKER_06]: growing and try to understand how the
growth and division of the cells is giving
[SPEAKER_06]: rise to the size and shape of the organ.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we've got living plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one I did back in the day,
taped onto a slide, and I've imaged it
[SPEAKER_06]: every six hours and watched those sepals
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a flower bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see here's one sepal, here's one
sepal, here's one sepal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you're seeing is a fluorescent
plasma membrane marker outlining the cells
[SPEAKER_06]: and fluorescent nuclear marker.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see there's all kinds of
complexity going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: These cells are not doing simple things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some cells are getting really big nuclei
and growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other cells are dividing and making a ton
of smaller cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of this is coming together to
coordinate so the sepals are growing at
[SPEAKER_06]: basically the same rate despite the cells
doing all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to continue the theme of
image analysis and say that we love to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand this computationally,
through computational image analysis,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is done in collaboration with Richard
Smith's lab with their amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: morphographic software.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll play that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've colored each cell and all of its
daughter cells with the same color.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't want to play.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can see that one green cell
gave rise to this whole patch of green
[SPEAKER_06]: cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one red cell gave rise to this whole
giant red cell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's how giant cells are forming.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're growing and not dividing the whole
time, whereas other cells are dividing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can measure the growth rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can measure the growth directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can measure all kinds of things from
these images and also gene expression
[SPEAKER_06]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying to put all of this
together to understand how this organ is
[SPEAKER_06]: growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we do a lot of molecular genetic work
that I can't possibly show you in this
[SPEAKER_06]: eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I come up with gene regulatory
networks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect you to understand anything
about this, except that there are genes
[SPEAKER_06]: interacting with each other, giving rise
to something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that something we like to model.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we collaborate.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is with Paul Formosa Jordan and his
postdoc Nicholas Russell to model the
[SPEAKER_06]: growth and division of these cells with
their decision-making process based on
[SPEAKER_06]: this gene regulatory network about whether
they divide or grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see we've got produce
fluctuating up and down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's coming out of this model is a
pattern of different cell sizes,
[SPEAKER_06]: fit like a sepal, where we've got giant
cells, see here in purple, interspersed
[SPEAKER_06]: between smaller cells and brown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see it's a model, give it
credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not quite like a sepal, but we're
still getting that pattern out of our gene
[SPEAKER_06]: regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the reasons I really love modeling
is not when it works like this does,
[SPEAKER_06]: but when it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it doesn't work, it tells us what
we're missing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, oh wait, we hadn't thought
about this part, or we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're quite right yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those never get published, but they're the
most important models, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my lab is really focused around two
major questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is, how are cells of different sizes
created during development?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're really looking at this,
how do we form giant cells in the sepal
[SPEAKER_06]: and the leaf, both have giant cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we found this really interesting role
for stochasticity or randomness in this
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: We think about development as being
deterministic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's programmed in, but actually,
the plant in this case is using randomness
[SPEAKER_06]: to generate this pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's exciting to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second question is sort of the flip
side of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got all the cellular variability.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are organs made with reproducible size
and shape?
[SPEAKER_06]: Spikes, variability in the cell growth,
the cell size, cell division, gene
[SPEAKER_06]: expression, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you look at across these
aromidopsis flowers, you can see they all
[SPEAKER_06]: have four sepals.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the four sepals in each flower are the
same size.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're the same across flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does the plant do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it make this reproducible
structure from this mess?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we want to apply this to
engineering living materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have recently got a grant from the
National Science Foundation and a big
[SPEAKER_06]: collaborative biology integration
institute, 12.5 million over six years,
[SPEAKER_06]: with a huge collaboration of people led by
Pam Soltis at University of Florida to
[SPEAKER_06]: study polyploidy because our giant cells
are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have more than one copy of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to look across organisms and
understand what does having more copies of
[SPEAKER_06]: the DNA do to the cells?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it make them bigger?
[SPEAKER_06]: What other properties does it have?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also are very interested in
applying this to engineering living
[SPEAKER_06]: materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our materials are not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'd like to actually use the
properties of living organisms
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically bacteria, fungi, and plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have amazing properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And can we incorporate them into our
materials, into our buildings,
[SPEAKER_06]: into even our chairs, into our clothing to
make them better?
[SPEAKER_06]: And think about what all of these
organisms are good at.
[SPEAKER_06]: They use non-petroleum based energy
sources.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can adapt.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can repair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about our roads.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we hate about our roads?
[SPEAKER_06]: All these potholes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Roads cannot self-repair.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if we incorporated living
materials into them so that they can
[SPEAKER_06]: self-repair?
[SPEAKER_06]: How awesome would that be?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dream at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a dream we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Laurie Huberman is part of this,
Engineering Living Materials Institute as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a bunch of challenges.
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking to the plant path group,
I think one of the big challenges is how
[SPEAKER_06]: do we incorporate different organisms
interacting with each other?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know we're going to have to
have many ecosystems to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The challenge that most fascinates me is
how do we engineer the shape and structure
[SPEAKER_06]: and mechanical properties and growth of
these organisms?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're starting this with a bunch of
diatoms because they have silica-based
[SPEAKER_06]: frustules.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're self-organized nanomaterials.
[SPEAKER_06]: So look how cool these little structures
are, how they can make them at room
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is work by my postdoc, Trevor Cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to thank my lab for all of this
inspirational work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could not do this without amazing
collaborators both at Cornell and beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank NIH and NSF for lots of funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed some models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder, how many parameters do the
models that you play with have?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many parameters of models we play with
have?
[SPEAKER_06]: We try to keep the parameter number as low
as possible because you can get anything
[SPEAKER_06]: to happen in a model if you add enough
parameters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really trying to limit it down to
things where we have some kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: biological basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, there is some level of
parameters you have to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the time we have no biological
information for those parameters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do a lot of parameter optimization
and look at in what regime do we get the
[SPEAKER_06]: behavior we expect?
[SPEAKER_06]: What regime do we get other things?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a lot to be done there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we're trying to keep the
parameter number low.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a question I've been wondering
about for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we so far cannot separate those two
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's one of the things I
would love to do is separate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need something that actually separates
ploidy from size.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't have it, which tells you what
a universal principle that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, what's cause and
effect?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's totally unclear at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow-up to the follow-up crowd here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything that you learned about
the filter feature from even to the best
[SPEAKER_05]: that create giant cells in the root
system?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so those giant cells are unrelated
to these giant cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually sent the molecular marker for
these giant cells to a group that was
[SPEAKER_06]: working on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was disappointing slightly.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I should say about these
giant cells is that they are little
[SPEAKER_06]: biosynthetic factories for a lot of
defensive compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our plants that overexpress giant
cells are actually more resistant things
[SPEAKER_06]: like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our plants without giant cells are
little farms of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some defense response going on
here that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Holly Tufon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an associate professor of plant
breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like Justine, even though she
didn't mention it, I started with
[SPEAKER_03]: lightening with an E.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, OK, I'll just use lights in
my title slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to give you a lightning talk
about our work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a bit strange to be here because
I actually did my PhD in molecular plant
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I do now is very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a parallel universe, this would be
my department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice to be home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start with a premise.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very busy, but I'm going to give
you the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is our agri-food systems are
driven by structural gender inequality.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that means is from value chains
producing, distributing to the food
[SPEAKER_03]: environment to consumer behavior are all
shaped by societal structural
[SPEAKER_03]: inequalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty well established at this
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we also know is how women
specifically engage in these agri-food
[SPEAKER_03]: systems globally is shaped by their
agency, social norms, their access and
[SPEAKER_03]: control over resources, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this schematically tells you there is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a global gender inequality in
agri-food systems, which then shapes
[SPEAKER_03]: outcomes from how people engage in those
agri-food systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving more intro slides because it's
going to be a little bit different from
[SPEAKER_03]: what you've watched.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the most recent thinking in this space
says, then if there is a problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do we rectify it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we change it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the levers of change towards more
equitable agri-food systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells us that we can look at
individuals engaging in agri-food systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: households, communities, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different layers where you can
affect change to really rectify the
[SPEAKER_03]: inequalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these look at institutional
inequalities, power relationships,
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies, and social institutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to come back to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a crash course in gender
inequality in food systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within that system of agri-food systems,
innovations, agricultural innovations are
[SPEAKER_03]: a sub-component.
[SPEAKER_03]: We innovate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We create new varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do mechanization so that we make
farmers' lives easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we know now is, again,
the latest thinking is innovations don't
[SPEAKER_03]: exist in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just develop a tractor and
airdrop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be more give and take with
the communities who are going to adopt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the latest thinking is around
context-dependent, socio-technical
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation bundles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that three times very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that basically means is, as you're
innovating for an agricultural technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: you must know where that technology will
take place.
[SPEAKER_03]: How in people's lives will it enter?
[SPEAKER_03]: How will they interact with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really need that context
dependency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by we, I mean the Equal Lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call ourselves the Equitable
Agricultural Research Lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just set up last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, we take an agricultural
innovation, which is crop improvement,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's end to end from the design of a
plant variety all the way to the release
[SPEAKER_03]: of seed systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we say, how can we really look at
gender equality and social inclusion in
[SPEAKER_03]: that whole process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, because these are complex problems,
we can't just do it unilaterally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a group of people from very
different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our lab is kind of a hodgepodge of
different disciplines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all kind of spend half our time
trying to communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the only way we can solve these
complex problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have people who have plant reading
backgrounds, economists, anthropologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all come together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you examples of what that
looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not tethered to a geography.
[SPEAKER_03]: We engage in a lot of different projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sites of the research tend to be
very different, as well as crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work on because it's agnostic to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: These inequalities are pervasive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not in one context.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what brings us together is how we
research using feminist research networks,
[SPEAKER_03]: frameworks, and approaches, and a lot of
transfer interdisciplinary methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not one solution to these
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do a lot of collaborative research.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of this happens on our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're constantly communicating,
working with programs globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to sit this on some sort of
organization, organizational principle,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you just seen, it's not a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way I look at it is we do work on
data generation, which basically means we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to understand what people in
different parts of the world and different
[SPEAKER_03]: social heterogeneity look for in crop
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I call data collection,
traits, bridal preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we collect that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do methodological work that says,
how do you collect data in a way that's
[SPEAKER_03]: more inclusive?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to synthesize that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're giving the right messages to the
plant breeding programs to say you should
[SPEAKER_03]: care about this or that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we do more analysis of the
research itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the more fun part in my personal
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have fancy videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm feeling a little disadvantaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll show you some examples of our
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: This may be very new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're probably thinking, OK,
what does this look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of research does this culminate
to?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give the examples of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the left, both of these graphs are on
cassava in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a lot of work with breeding
programs there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question the breeders often ask
is, who wants what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What traits matter to whom and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: What varieties matter to whom and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems easy, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So years and years of data have
accumulated on what farmers want from
[SPEAKER_03]: traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we also know is that farmers are
not homogeneous groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they are, what kind of households
they're living in, matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on this rather busy plot on the left,
we're trying to pull apart trait
[SPEAKER_03]: preferences for these traits on the bottom
through a heat map here that we're showing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a woman or a man living in a
poor, non-poor household, food secure,
[SPEAKER_03]: insecure, poor different regions,
you may get different patterns of trait
[SPEAKER_03]: preferences, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeders don't like to see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we like to tell them it matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Context matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social heterogeneity matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for trait preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see here is when it's called the
placket loose tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this is telling you is these are
varieties in rank order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on if the farmer is a man or a
woman, and if they're interacting with a
[SPEAKER_03]: man or a woman to process, you get
different varietal preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we know is it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, people don't live in
bubbles, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may have different preferences
because of those social infections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bottom line is we're trying to move
away from these homogeneous trait buckets
[SPEAKER_03]: and really try to understand social
heterogeneity at the individual level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving a little bit up, one thing that
I've become really interested in is
[SPEAKER_03]: methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine you're going to a household.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to ask people, what kind of
cassava do you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That itself is a big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Often it's surveys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have to ask yourself,
who is responding to the survey?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of power in politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who takes that survey?
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left here, you see Colonel
Benson.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a density plot where we're
asking husbands and wives from the same
[SPEAKER_03]: household the same question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many cassava varieties do you grow
that are improved?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go to the field and we take
the leaf samples and we compare them,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is nobody's consistent,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The husband's responses and the wife's
responses differ from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they both differ from the actual leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here, I don't want to say anyone's
right or wrong because when we go and do
[SPEAKER_03]: this and we ask people at the plot level,
you get a different picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point here is who you ask and how
matters hugely for adoption rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our assumptions around a variety is
adopted or not may be based on wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who you ask matters hugely, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is work in Senegal and Calpe where we
had five different traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked, again, husbands and wives
for their relative preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up here, classic, we separate men and
women with a relative importance,
[SPEAKER_03]: the higher the more important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then what we did was we took the same
couples and we classified them by
[SPEAKER_03]: agreement and disagreement on who makes
decisions in the household, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we're saying, are there some
households that are more kind of together?
[SPEAKER_03]: And are there more households where
there's more disagreement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that matter for the choices that make
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Readers don't like us when they see this
because it does matter, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we're trying to tease apart to
say, how can we ask these questions so you
[SPEAKER_03]: get good information?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is a scoping review we did last
year just to tell you, we looked across
[SPEAKER_03]: all trait preference papers globally for
all crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked the question, how are people
collecting information?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see is it's often direct
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when someone gets asked, what do you
like or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And often we don't have data from women.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the gender bias in the totality of
the data is significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't actually have data on women's
trait preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joss is staring at me, so I'm gonna wrap
up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the highest level work that I
think is really exciting where we turn the
[SPEAKER_03]: lens back on the researchers themselves a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we say we are social beings engaging
in research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not robots, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have characters, we have histories,
we have social identities.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that shape how we're actually
doing research?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of theory out there that
shows that's true in other fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have two sets of work coming here
looking at care responsibilities of
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do faculty balance care
responsibilities and their social
[SPEAKER_03]: identities?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that play out?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one is management
leadership.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean to be a woman in an
international agricultural research
[SPEAKER_03]: ecosystem and for their management
abilities and perceptions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a much higher level thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanna thank my lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two main names to name here,
and I try to put them on the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_03]: work that we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions, Pahali?
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be good to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't often look at soil nutrient
status, and this is, I think, where
[SPEAKER_03]: disciplinary practice comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Often these questions are asked by
economists.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at globally how the data is
collected, economists do these surveys a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often it's just, I ask you the
question, I have a box, and I ticket,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I walk away.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do control for is you're running
kind of like a regression.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look to see if there's any covariance
that are actually explaining some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do check if there's things that are
bigger than the actual trait preference
[SPEAKER_03]: itself, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, we do check that as much as we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're generating data for trait
preference as a snapshot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So contemporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any way of generating data on
a trajectory historically and forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the scoping review, we tried to do
that for 50 years, all crops, to see what
[SPEAKER_03]: are the trends in the trait preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest problem is ontologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every study will define a trait in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so extracting that and relating them
to one another is hugely difficult,
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's no standard for social
research on traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say yield, I say, yield size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone has to decide those are equivalent
to look at the totality of the data set.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something we're working on right now
to be able to synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am happy to tell you a little bit about
my research and what I do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start off with a first slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let's get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is a photo taken outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was taken just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this photo, you can see the tower row
lined with trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spend a lot of time thinking about
how we interact with plants in this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of day-to-day level outside of these
agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I focus on the
health-relevant interactions that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can include everything from the
services that these trees provide in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of cooling on a hot day through both
shading and transpiration through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: removal of air pollution, such as
particulate matter from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of work that shows
really extensive mental health benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: through exposure to green spaces and all
sorts of other ecosystem services that are
[SPEAKER_00]: also health-relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we have all of these
negative interactions with plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from the release of allergenic
pollen to the release of volatile organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds like isoprene, which is a
precursor to ozone formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the most urban areas, we still
have landscapes that are filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, near New York City is
currently, 22% of it is forested.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a year ago now, there was some local
legislation passed to try and increase New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City's canopy coverage of trees up to
30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the major justifications for
this was people said, hey, trees really
[SPEAKER_00]: improve public health, so let's have more
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just isolated to New York
City, and we're living at a time when
[SPEAKER_00]: cities across the United States and the
rest of the world, too, are also
[SPEAKER_00]: channeling resources into planting trees
and a little bit less into maintaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: trees that they already have, much to the
chagrin of urban foresters and other urban
[SPEAKER_00]: tree professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, there's about $2 billion
being put into urban forestry in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Inflation Reduction Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even though one of the major
motivations for this is improving public
[SPEAKER_00]: health through making there be more trees,
we don't really have a good understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of how many of these trees, how the
individual trees interact with individual
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a lot of these large-scale
patterns, like, hey, if a neighborhood has
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more green space in it, it tends to
be cooler, but when you get down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of how is this individual tree
transpiring, how is it providing shade,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have very good information at
that granular scale, which is a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are the scales at which we
make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't tend to say, oh, we're going to
change this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, no, we're going to plant a tree
right here, and then we make decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: about where that tree is, what type of
tree it is, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal and the work that's being
done in my lab focuses on quantifying
[SPEAKER_00]: these interactions with plants in order to
improve the decisions that we make,
[SPEAKER_00]: often around tree management and so on,
but also around our behaviors as people,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, in order to improve the health of
people as individuals and as a broader
[SPEAKER_00]: group as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to walk you through what
this looks like, although you'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me because this is a little bit of
a listicle right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focus on me, not the boring text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the major projects that I have
right now is looking at allergenic pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, and I'll tell you a little
bit more about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major project that I'm working on
is trying to understand the cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of trees in New York City on an
individual tree scale in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what heat exposure is like,
what the health consequences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, how does that affect the
number of people who are going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency department during heat waves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, to be able to inform
decisions as we're making all of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all of these urban greening
campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant a tree, it lasts for a long
time, and so we really should be figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: this out now because the consequences of
today's decisions are going to last with
[SPEAKER_00]: us for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of this project, I'm doing a lot
of work with a postdoc in my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Miller, trying to use remote sensing
to identify individual trees because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do a good job of managing what you
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're using some new approaches,
incorporating the timing of various life
[SPEAKER_00]: history events for trees, things like when
is it leafing out, what color does it look
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the fall, to try and untangle this
a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really using the ecology to inform some
of the remote sensing analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other projects that are
happening in the lab now touch a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on some of the associations between
things like neighborhood income or race
[SPEAKER_00]: and ethnicity and how that is associated
with what trees are where.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there end up being, it seems,
large health consequences for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things as different types of trees
provide different services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few of the projects that
are happening in the lab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last little bit, I just want
to walk you through an example of what one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these projects looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so come with me to Texas now and take
a look at Ash Juniper, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most common trees in central Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray things you see here are not
clouds in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pollen being released from this
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you some context here,
people begin to experience allergic
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions to this pollen at concentrations
as low as 10 or 20 pollen grains per cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: meter of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single pollen cone on one of these trees
has about half a million pollen grains in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might see up to a million pollen
grains, or a million pollen cones,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, on one of these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do is to
understand both what the health
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences are through epidemiological
analyses as well as to create operational
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that most of the pollen
forecasts that you might find through your
[SPEAKER_00]: weather app, they're not total garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like the unvalidated,
like completely, well, I'll pause for
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on it, but there's a lot to be
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold myself back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the approaches that we take
are doing field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So field campaigns to take manual
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also work with citizen science
organizations, especially the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge Network, to enlist people to
help us take these measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also do a lot of scaling up to
try and understand what is happening with
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plants, and then to take that
up to a site level, and ultimately to
[SPEAKER_00]: regions or across an entire state,
and someday, I hope, across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the processes that we try and
understand are fairly simple, like how
[SPEAKER_00]: much pollen is applied to the plant
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Justine, I'm really excited to
think with you about some of the methods
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've been using because we too hate
counting and trying to avoid it as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of things we try and
understand are when pollen is being
[SPEAKER_00]: released or how it moves through the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's most of that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool things about the
intricacies of the remote sensing we are
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to know more about it,
you'll have to come stop by my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're up in Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to talking with you all
more.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will make an observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's what's exciting to see
some of this wonderful work, urban plant
[SPEAKER_01]: science, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've just hired a new urban plant
ecologist, Karen Sexton.
[SPEAKER_01]: We joined us very shortly, and I can see
already all sorts of threads that can
[SPEAKER_01]: connect in with you and also Justine and
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sitting here and listening to
these talks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean-Luc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you also have models with a bunch of
parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and do some models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, a lot of this is trying to
create predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are often OK with throwing a lot
of things and seeing what sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, we do try and think about what
is most biologically meaningful and take
[SPEAKER_00]: out the things that don't have much
predictive value.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thanks, y'all.
