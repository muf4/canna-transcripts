[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Tom, for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have had a lot of conversation
with Tom over the last several years,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually as a practitioner landscape
architect looking for research advice on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to set up this design experiment,
this research experiment in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had, you know, he's been
incredibly valuable in that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reading the website for the
horticulture program at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that actually it's part of your
mission is this kind of agenda to
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinate and communicate with various
publics and to kind of spread knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that kind of
perspective and the agenda of the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of academic and applied,
which is what I've been trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run the Urban Ecology and Design Lab,
which is a recent formation about 2010
[SPEAKER_00]: where we focus on studying and reshaping
human settlements through research and
[SPEAKER_00]: design with the goal of advancing urban
sustainability and resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I emphasize this combination of
studying and shaping because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the interdisciplinary approach
that I try to bring to projects is a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of combination of ecological research to
help quantify different, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological systems, particularly the novel
ecosystems we're creating in urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, but also recognizing that
these systems aren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning in any kind of optimized way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we shape them as a designer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab focuses on construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It focuses on constructed ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction ecosystems are ecosystems
that are engineered by human actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be intentional or
unintentional, and they're often promoted
[SPEAKER_00]: as valuable, but their ecosystem functions
and values have not really been that well
[SPEAKER_00]: assessed or evaluated over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some interesting examples like
Michael von Volkenberg's General Mills
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, has anyone seen this project
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was part of the corporate
landscape at General Mills in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a prairie, constructed
artificial prairie landscape that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: was surrounded by birch trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of a strange twist on the idea
of fire burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I guess if you turn birch inside
out, you can actually, it's fire
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the General Mills corporate
office liked it for a little while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually it kind of got old and they
removed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't working very well during the
burn events when you had guys in business
[SPEAKER_00]: suits coming in for corporate meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of the aesthetic didn't
carry over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although in our minds, I think the
aesthetic of a burned prairie is something
[SPEAKER_00]: magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So constructed ecosystems, it's also
building on the recognition that
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial ecosystems are largely
constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole wave of kind of
refocusing our attention on what we mean
[SPEAKER_00]: by ecosystems today, domesticated nature,
carriba, or the idea of futuristic
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration projects, including the field
of restoration ecology, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: grappling with the ideas of historic
reference landscapes as a guide for
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstructing ecosystems versus targeted
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is sort of where I'm
trying to build my own practice as a
[SPEAKER_00]: designer or ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have examples like Turkey Point in
Florida, where highly artificial landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: that was constructed really as a cooling
system for heated water from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up supporting 25% of the adult
population of crocodiles in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got this kind of sort of
happenstance opportunities like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ways in which we can start to
construct ecosystems, combining them with
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, thinking about the
resources that we're producing in urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments to promote those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this has to do with human
perception and the way that we conceive of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and the way that we conceive of
ecosystem functions and the kind of tools
[SPEAKER_00]: and methodologies we have to either
quantify or interpret those ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that a certain amount of my time
is spent negotiating with stakeholders and
[SPEAKER_00]: working on compromise and sort of win-win
solutions as a way of developing
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological strategies within an urban
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I place a lot of emphasis on
implementation also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a set of bioswales that we're
constructing in Bridgeport, that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed in Bridgeport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, my approach in part is
publication, but also publication in the
[SPEAKER_00]: real world, where you're building systems
that are part of the urban environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating their performance over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know when you think about urban
systems that they're compromised and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're young and novel systems and that
there's global environmental changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are taking place that are impacting those
systems in fundamental ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also understand that our
understanding of those systems is somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand that some parts of these
systems, but not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between the parts,
and we're making choices on incomplete
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're making choices at scales that
may or may not be relevant to people or to
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological function or making those link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, there's kind of an issue in
terms of recognizing the novelty of urban
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and the challenges or the
shortcomings of research practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we bridge those together?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with that kind of dilemma
in current society?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard a number of sort of
interests in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, ESA, the student group is now
calling or has what they call Action
[SPEAKER_00]: Science or Action Ecology, where there's a
kind of proactive stance or proactive
[SPEAKER_00]: agenda to the ecological practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of can conflict with ideas of
advocacy or the role of objectivity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences and kind of how that manifests
within sort of a practice-oriented
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sort of am trying my best to bypass
or to incorporate some of those issues
[SPEAKER_00]: into my own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call this area, I'm calling this kind
of ecological urban design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still sort of piecing together what
the right terminology might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but essentially it's a combination of
design and ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a role for practitioner scientists
who is, in my case, a landscape architect
[SPEAKER_00]: and ecologist, but obviously you can have
a variety of combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary practices in order to
start to investigate this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm basically combining urban design
with ecological engineering at some level
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop constructed ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really concentrate on parks and
parkland networks, land development and
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat, and urban forests, stormwater
hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of a jack of all trades,
but part of my approach is through
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with multiple parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I think within these constructed
ecosystems, if you talk to any scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with urban ecology, they're going
to make the argument that we really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to experiment and to evaluate and to start
to develop a vocabulary and data and
[SPEAKER_00]: information that lets us understand what
we're talking about with urban ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the theoretical framework in which
we're anticipating or analyzing urban
[SPEAKER_00]: systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of discussion early on about
shifting from ecology in the city to
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology of the city where there was
identifying plants and animals in urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and starting to think of
human social ecological factors as
[SPEAKER_00]: constructs of urban systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's still new and
developing and urban ecological theory has
[SPEAKER_00]: not really evolved or manifested in a way
that everyone's comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a kind of field in flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I too am very much aligned with this
agenda of establishing research as a goal
[SPEAKER_00]: or as a first step to understand systems
that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I published an article with Stuart
Pickett in 2005 called Design Experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at new approaches to studying
urban ecosystems, where you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: develop, you kind of bridge or meld
analysis with implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bridge applied management with
academic science and you facilitate
[SPEAKER_00]: situating research in multiple locations
in urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to incorporate an education
component because you're essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a public research experiment and
navigates the complex public process in
[SPEAKER_00]: government agencies, which I would say the
experiment itself may or may not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the combination of design and
ecology allows you to move back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: and negotiate opportunities with
government agencies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to start to incorporate
research as a component of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: in urban environments, which is a central
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives a public identity and
negotiates sort of public space values
[SPEAKER_00]: versus ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes advantage of ecologists who
are already studying complex systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: are already involved in trying to
interpret, you know, multiple variables,
[SPEAKER_00]: complex analysis on species interactions,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ecologists have already been sort of
banging their head against trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: decipher and interpret ecosystem functions
in non-urban systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an opportunity to take advantage
of ecological methods, ecological theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to start thinking about what it means
for urban design, urban ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And designers, in my mind, are agents of
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And agents, I think, is an important term
here because they can help ecologists in
[SPEAKER_00]: situating research experiments in urban
contexts and weaving research experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: into public or into decision-making or
into public institutions like parkland,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I have sort of three focus
areas of my own, and two of which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to really talk about today,
green infrastructure, ecological planning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wildlife habitat, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just mention on the wildlife
habitat side just for kind of to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a context that my PhD research actually
was looking at suburbanization in
[SPEAKER_00]: amphibian populations with a large-scale
land development 40 miles north of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually basically was working as a
master planner on a master planning team
[SPEAKER_00]: with EDAW, with a related company in New
York, and they were developing a
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,200-acre, about a 500-hectare site 40
miles north that had a lot of amphibian
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, a lot of breeding populations
on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they wanted to develop,
and the amphibians were in the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially, which is the typical story of
a large land development project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I sold the developer on the idea
that we could incorporate research on
[SPEAKER_00]: migration patterns and look at amphibian
migration as a way of actually increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity for housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually made the developer money in
our first analysis, somewhere around $7
[SPEAKER_00]: million worth of housing property,
because essentially the vernal pool system
[SPEAKER_00]: that was surrounded by a loop road and
was, you know, inevitably devastated
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is the watershed,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not only migration corridors,
but watershed impacts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was the planning board,
the environmental consultant hired by the
[SPEAKER_00]: planning board identified this as a
problematic issue, and really it was
[SPEAKER_00]: raised as an obstacle to kind of slow down
the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the developer wanted to make sure he
got the 24 houses that were there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so he was looking for any options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was, well, let's do a
migration study, look at where the
[SPEAKER_00]: migrating patterns are, and since
amphibians are fairly predictable in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the migration paths, we could realign
housing and have these kind of migration
[SPEAKER_00]: corridors almost like teeth in the
location of the houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was we did the migration
65 percent were coming from this angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so the developer immediately thought
of the idea of shifting housing to either
[SPEAKER_00]: side, which ended up preserving the
watershed as well and maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: migration corridors and getting 16 houses
out of 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was so excited about it that he
actually let me do the same research
[SPEAKER_00]: across the entire property to inform the
overall master plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ended up, this was the first
site that we studied and the migration
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up setting up the same kind of
research and analysis and reorganizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: development, which is shown here in this
kind of gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting rid of one of the major roads,
moving neighborhoods around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, typical of the developer,
you know, they have a pro forma with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain number of houses that they're
trying to get into a site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you push in one area, then it pops
up in another area, which is exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of a, this relationship
between academic research and land
[SPEAKER_00]: development is an interesting one because,
of course, the developer took advantage or
[SPEAKER_00]: used the empirical data that was coming
out of the analysis to his advantage to
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiate housing and to push past some of
the time constraints of some of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints that are typical of the
permitting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second stage, we actually did a
larval density study looking at variation
[SPEAKER_00]: in habitat quality across ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noted that the typical habitat
assessment approaches with vernal pool
[SPEAKER_00]: systems are looking at species
populations, species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a prioritized component.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found was in setting up a
research experiment where I put amphibian
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, where I stocked amphibian
populations in each pond with 0,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, 16, and 24 to look at whether density
was more, had more of an impact over
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that habitat variation explained a
lot more of the survival and growth rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of the amphibians above population
density, which starts to suggest or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least opens the questions about whether
current habitat assessment practices are
[SPEAKER_00]: effective or not or whether they need to
prioritize wetland habitat more than
[SPEAKER_00]: species population density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up finding on the study also
in the process the least true because we
[SPEAKER_00]: were wrapping fences with, you know,
we were wrapping ponds with drift fences,
[SPEAKER_00]: which meant that you basically caught
everything that moved in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had these incidentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was the least true,
which turned out to be an endangered
[SPEAKER_00]: species which raised other issues for the
developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very funny back and forth that
happened where a lawsuit went out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: developer from the town to address this
issue of species that weren't identified
[SPEAKER_00]: during the EIS report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then basically from that I
developed a series of scales of importance
[SPEAKER_00]: that land developers, sorry, that master
planners currently are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating into their process of design
and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the meta-population is simply
not interpreted at all, except you might
[SPEAKER_00]: argue that some of the habitat corridors
developed are towards that intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really very little attention
to watersheds, which are kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental part of amphibian breeding
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migration corridors, you know,
the ponds in New York have zero buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Jersey you have a hundred foot
buffer, but amphibians travel as much as a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a discrepancy between these as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this approach, you know,
the approach that I was using in my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: was really focused on marrying science and
research practices with master planning,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a particular side of this
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has more to do with conservation,
I think, than kind of the proactive
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed ecosystem approach that I
introduced at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to return now to this idea of
constructed ecosystems and look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly at restoration ecologists,
who I see as one of several
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-disciplines that are actually
grappling with what it means to
[SPEAKER_00]: reinterpret their theory and basis of
practice in the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's, part of this is that
restoration ecologists are now working
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more with designers to develop
park systems that are functional or have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of ecosystem components to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, originally Stephen Handel
from Rutgers was working with Michael Van
[SPEAKER_00]: Valkenberg's office on the Brooklyn Bridge
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, Great Ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, there's ideas about
wetland construction that are taking place
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly constrained, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the benefits that you get for the
costs are kind of not, you can't really do
[SPEAKER_00]: that analysis very easily for such an
urbanized park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a great park in Orange County
in California that Handel is working on as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where there's basically an effort to
marry or to program parkland for
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological benefit, and then the issue
becomes, well, how do you incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: human use patterns into this ecologically
structured park system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the dilemmas,
I think, within the restoration field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, there's a unique
heritage within restoration ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an intentional activity that
initiates or accelerates the recovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: an ecosystem with respect to its health,
integrity, and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attempts to return an ecosystem to its
historic trajectory based on reference
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it relies on careful and systematic
planning and monitoring approaches with
[SPEAKER_00]: established goals and performance metrics
towards ecosystem recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this opportunity for
restoration and applied ecology where
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners are trying or looking to
expand their territories, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has to do with the number of
factors that we're facing today,
[SPEAKER_00]: including invasive species or coastal
resilience and global warming,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see it as uniquely placed,
but I also think it provides a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to expose some of the issues
that we face in how to marry the,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how to rethink our approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, their restoration ecology builds
on things like agriculture, where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with production and optimization
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole working component to
restoration ecology that has relevance
[SPEAKER_00]: within an urban context.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, where there's incomplete
knowledge and there's the necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: necessity to make decisions on incomplete
knowledge, which I think is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between a lot of the applied
ecologists and the basic science
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's expanding into these new
applications, adaption, adaptation
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, efforts to quantify ecosystem
services, ways of controlling invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species, thinking about natural
landscaping to substitute for lawns or
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat in public park amenities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they're working on land
types that are fundamentally urban and
[SPEAKER_00]: that have, that really need to be
reevaluated and reconstructed for future
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion of ecosystem services in urban
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dealing with abandoned sites,
brownfields, wetlands, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's questions about what
to prioritize and how important are people
[SPEAKER_00]: in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're following,
if you're following the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you, do you follow the money or do
you follow the best ecological benefits in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of prioritization?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you assess the long-term
resilience and sustainability?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this other aspect of the
aesthetic form, I think, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important component of restoration ecology
that I'll mention in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this idea of defining
ecosystem function.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you define these systems with an
urbanized construct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, historically restoration
ecologists have tended towards
[SPEAKER_00]: naturalistic design strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I would say that most
restoration ecologists probably would not
[SPEAKER_00]: say that they have a design ideology,
there's a default design ideology which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially naturalistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construct a system to make it look like
nature, you know, and also hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: construct a system to make it function
like nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking like nature doesn't
necessarily mean functioning like nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and looking like nature also has some
problems with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, and this is something that
Joy Zettler has mentioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you construct these systems that look
natural and you go through the pains of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of organizing it in organic forms,
it often can be from a construction
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint more costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you, it's hard to compare those
systems to other systems that you create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not actually, you're actually
losing an opportunity to embed research
[SPEAKER_00]: components and modularity into the system
that you can evaluate over time and test
[SPEAKER_00]: and evaluate performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you end up spending a fair
amount of money constructing a system
[SPEAKER_00]: that's essentially a one-off and that you
can evaluate as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue in my mind at least is
that, you know, funding opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get funding to construct these
kinds of things, often the funder is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something that can be
identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a restoration site next
to an adjacent natural area, and they look
[SPEAKER_00]: almost the same, it becomes kind of
difficult for, you know, to get money or
[SPEAKER_00]: solicit funding in an urbanized world
where you're, you know, you want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some identity or meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on top of that, I think many
restoration ecologists remain dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: their traditional practices, which is
understandable because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way the notion, identifying a
historic reference is sort of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a way forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to have, to validate
decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have that approach,
and you're thinking only into the future
[SPEAKER_00]: or into some kind of, you know,
futuristic or target ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more challenging to think,
to decide what you prioritize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so as restoration ecologists expand
their breadth, they're rethinking
[SPEAKER_00]: reference ecosystems, and they're more and
more working with stakeholder communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an example of a recent project
that I see as being kind of a futuristic
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, have people gone to the
Museum of Modern Art Rising Currents
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anyone make it down to the,
the Rising Currents?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some interesting projects
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, fairly architectural,
but Kate Orff's project by, called Oyster
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture, was this notion of taking the
life cycle of the oyster and mapping it
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the harbor of New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She basically, the notion was essentially
to organize the early stage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organism so that it would essentially play
a role in cleaning the Kiwanis Canal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to move that system into a kind
of wave attenuation structure that would,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you essentially plant these
organisms along as a kind of buffer or
[SPEAKER_00]: wave attenuation for New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, and she started to bridge
those ideas with, you know, pedestrian
[SPEAKER_00]: paths, for example, where the ecological
systems would be underneath the path for
[SPEAKER_00]: ease of access, and started to incorporate
it into the design of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so part of this idea or this
approach to bridge ecological strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: with design and to kind of build on the
restoration ecology approach has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find, again and again, that I'm
trying to determine where and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a struggle for
the science world, because ultimately you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, you don't, there's things that you
can compromise, and there's things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't, and it's, it's a tough,
you know, it's a challenge to decide what
[SPEAKER_00]: you give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I asked John Aber
when he was visiting Yale recently was
[SPEAKER_00]: whether, you know, if, he was actually
talking about this notion of compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked, are there ways in which we
would then compromise the science in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to incorporate it into, for example,
into the time scale of a land development
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a land development master planning
process takes, you know, nine months to a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, or maybe a year and a half,
you know, there's only so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, research that you're going to be
able to do that's from a science
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective that's going to be valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might get one season,
you might get two seasons in if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in other words,
you don't, the data results aren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as useful from a science
perspective, aren't going to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, you know, and we debated or
discussed that topic, and his sense was
[SPEAKER_00]: that the science is a science,
and the approach is, you stick by a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain methodology that's been developed,
or your results are not as useful or not
[SPEAKER_00]: as valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this is a real struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked into this a little bit while
working at EDAW.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a client and practice grant to
participate with Presidio Trust,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if folks have been to this
pretty amazing post-military landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: right in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting for a lot of reasons,
but there's a number of stakeholders
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the cultural historians who
basically, you know, it's a historic
[SPEAKER_00]: landmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are the buildings
historically landmarked, but the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: is historically landmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that have been there,
it was one of the largest afforestation
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts in the country from the 1880s,
1890s, where they're actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: trees were planted in monoculture blocks
in regiments to mimic the military
[SPEAKER_00]: history, eucalyptus, and a variety of
other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew up into a mature canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole ecosystem, this scrub-shrub
community, coastal community, is a
[SPEAKER_00]: forested environment that a lot of people
think of as being the historic nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's very complicated stakeholder
relationships to this landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: partly historical, partly the public users
who walk their dogs there and would die to
[SPEAKER_00]: see these trees removed, you know,
partly the maintenance folks and partly
[SPEAKER_00]: the restoration folks who actually are
very keen on removing the forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to replace it with a biologically
rich environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were working with each of these
stakeholders and through dialogue,
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiating or learning about what their
drivers were, what their interests were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dealt with public groups,
with nature lovers, and with historical
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, you know, this is all,
by the way, a national park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went shifted from a military base to
a national park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's under the National Park Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most urban, or one of the most
urban national parks, I guess Gateway in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, not only is it public,
the local public who live adjacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually 60 million square
feet of real estate on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people actually rent property on the
historic base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's people living right outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the entire United States
public who has rights to this land as the
[SPEAKER_00]: national park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were working on a particular area
that is becoming their sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a biologically rich sort of
creek bed here that had the general's
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the top right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And military housing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is the only community
garden on the entire property.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of hundreds and hundreds of
people that want to have a community
[SPEAKER_00]: garden on the Presidio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the historic stakeholders have fought
them off for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the restoration ecologists,
or sorry, the community gardeners then
[SPEAKER_00]: went into the map library and looked
through old maps and found that there had
[SPEAKER_00]: been a victory garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this particular property, on this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they got their garden, their
community garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a one acre piece out of about
1200 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a pretty interesting site
because it had been designed as a public
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a historical garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with the general's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also had been left alone for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the community developed restoration
ecology group had a greenhouse system
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had been pretty actively restoring
this creek bed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of involvement here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last point was that the same group
that had worked here had worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspiration Point, which is right around
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically Inspiration Point is the
highest point in Presidio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got, or had at one point,
a fantastic view of the whole bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trees had grown up and blocked the
entire view so you couldn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Presidio Trust coordinated with the
local restoration ecologists and developed
[SPEAKER_00]: a community driven restoration project
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Presidio Trust came out at night and
cut down the trees, removed them and had
[SPEAKER_00]: them, right away the morning after
everyone was out planting locally gathered
[SPEAKER_00]: seed plants from local genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was this kind of political strategy
using ecological restoration folks as a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of means to negotiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the view is fantastic now
and everyone's happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to get past that first wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found in our analysis that
essentially there wasn't one solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: this strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too small to really have your cake
and eat it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up with this idea that this
bridge that actually really just became a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an illustration of the compromises
that one might make with a site like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially you could have wildlife
habitat and no human access where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could view over the system or maybe you
have a bridge that crosses it so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled access and wildlife viewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could have complete access and make
it into a park system so it becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: of an integrated park but then your
ecological benefits aside from water
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and impacts that are highly
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found from this was that you
ended up with a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more valuable in an urban park
setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it public access or habitat
preservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What takes precedent in a historic
national park?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystem function or historic
preservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can public use and recreation be
integrated with habitat enhancement and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled visitation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can one ensure that opposing
stakeholders reach a winning consensus
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than everyone giving up too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which in some ways is what we found
through this process is that no one was
[SPEAKER_00]: really willing to give up their
perspective easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I've talked a little bit about
design experiments and this strategy that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting forward in terms of
coupling ecological research and urban
[SPEAKER_00]: design as a means to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the argument is here,
traditional research approaches you set
[SPEAKER_00]: up, ecologists are looking to study a
system to understand how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you set up experimentation,
you analyze the system and from your
[SPEAKER_00]: results you can get ideas as a kind of
adaptive management for example to alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the system and as a kind of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: With design experiments, you're sort of
taking for granted, you're assuming that
[SPEAKER_00]: the system is not necessarily working all
that well or you're working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed system where you can
manipulate the system and put in a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: new functioning system that you can then
analyze over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a kind of proactive approach that
brings in the science and research
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy but it brings it in in the
process of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the same time, experimentation has
an interesting aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's spatial sort of modularity to the
experimentation, there's a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: geometry driven by statistical means or
statistical needs but it actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to kind of a design aesthetic or
design practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about that in a
second but I wanted to give you an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of a design experiment that I proposed for
the High Line where basically it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: prairie ecosystem, a highly constructed
prairie ecosystem on porous paving and you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically use a fire retardant material
periodically and you'd burn a strip and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that would become your path and then
two or three years down the line you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: burn another strip and then that would
become your path and then it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: self-seeding prairie kind of landscape for
education purposes for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, design experiments have
this stake holder outreach or stake holder
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement component to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the public realm, it's a research
driven but it's also implementation based
[SPEAKER_00]: and through this kind of implementation
practice such as a project that I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on in Harlem on a community garden at
123rd Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of getting people involved and
you start to, you know, people come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the woodwork or start to participate in
land development especially in an
[SPEAKER_00]: urbanized context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally it's really the intention
is also to generate and develop urban
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just start to think about ways such as
Larry Baker's work on household scale
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem dynamics to think about scales
of analysis that are appropriate or that
[SPEAKER_00]: are meaningful to decision makers,
policy makers or homeowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've mentioned this idea of the
aesthetics of experimentation and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to just go through and show you a
few examples of what I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's Tillman's work,
you know, there's these kind of mesocosm
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas, Hubbard Brook, this is the Million
Trees project that I'm gonna show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, going back to the idea
of the concern that I raised about
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration ecologists and how there's a
default naturalistic design intent behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a designer going through, for example,
my experience at Harvard, everyone is
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper sensitive to what your design
influences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hyper sensitivity and actually for
landscape architects in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest challenges is how to
get out of underneath the shadow of
[SPEAKER_00]: Olmsted who has created this incredible
shadow partly because of his, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of his amazing projects and the
breadth of his projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he brought in this whole
notion of the picturesque from the English
[SPEAKER_00]: which really evolved out of a rural
agrarian landscape quality that ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: that went through painting and made its
way to landscape design and then when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was brought to the states, my
interpretation is that it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coagulated or sort of gelled with the
wilderness ethic or the wilderness concept
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, people have talked about
the idea that Yellowstone was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: selected because it had been cleared
periodically through burning practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: reminded people of the idyllic nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as a landscape architect,
this is actually a pretty big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do I design naturalistically or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a sort of branch in the
field and a lot of landscape architects
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with redefining an aesthetic
while often being pegged as or being
[SPEAKER_00]: requested to do naturalistic design
because not only is it a dilemma in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field of landscape architecture,
it's a perception or an idea held by
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans at large because Olmsted's park
systems and others afterwards essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced the picturesque across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone, when you think about a park
or most people when you think about a
[SPEAKER_00]: park, you think of a picturesque style or
naturalistic park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different in Europe where
there's a lot of geometry as a component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So design experiments bypass that
ideological layer and get ecologists and
[SPEAKER_00]: designers negotiating and working around
statistical drivers and geometry and
[SPEAKER_00]: modularity as a medium through which you
can come up with design aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Robert Smithson's project where he
called a non-site where he would take
[SPEAKER_00]: material from sites, organize it in some
sort of a frame, and then bring it offsite
[SPEAKER_00]: and have these kind of like the six
materials of his site would all be in
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very interested in what material
meant when it was removed from an area or
[SPEAKER_00]: a given kind of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's Alan Sanborn's
topographic projections where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of effort to create modularity around
an organic form, you know, and to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: frame that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a whole investigation into
dynamic systems and dynamic patterns and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to represent those or how to represent
multifaceted perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of dynamic ecosystems has
relevance in the art world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question partly of determining how
to bridge the dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that I've kind of pushed for this
idea of a collage aesthetic which
[SPEAKER_00]: basically takes maybe some of Gleason's
mapping of prairie ecosystems in the UW
[SPEAKER_00]: Arboretum in that dynamic nature and
builds on the data-rich capacity of
[SPEAKER_00]: designers today or the ability to kind of
crunch a lot of information with various
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to think about a design
aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been interested in Rem
Koolhaus' project for Downsview Park as a
[SPEAKER_00]: site for researching island biogeography
and habitat corridors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really part of the study at all,
but it's, you know, he had this notion
[SPEAKER_00]: that he would create circles of ecosystems
or circles of landscape that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed and, you know, it would be
great to set up some kind of a large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: study on animal migration patterns or
animal movement patterns across these
[SPEAKER_00]: patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's precedent for combining
science and design going back,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going way back, but I think Mel
Chen's revival field with USDA chemists in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the earliest reclamation projects
in the country funded by art money for
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of science project I think is a
really interesting example of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I want to just now take you into
or discuss the Million Trees project which
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on first at EDAW, which actually
EDAW merged with AECOM design,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it became a giant conglomerate while I
was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically we, sorry, we won the
project in 2008 with, it was through EDAW
[SPEAKER_00]: and Donna Wolkavage in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donna had an on-call contract with the
Parks Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eight landscape architecture
firms that have on-call contracts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Parks Department,
and so any project that comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they bid on it, and whoever is deemed the
best bidder wins the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this project came along, it was a
very unusual project for those eight
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners because it really had an
underlying, you know, research and science
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and the kinds of issues that the
Cornell Horticulture is probably maybe one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most adept, you know, or the kind
of depth that you show here, but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner world, you know, you don't
have that kind of knowledge base thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to construct an urban forest,
you know, and so Donna called EDAW and we
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to partner and then we created a
series of outreach efforts, including my
[SPEAKER_00]: telephone calls to Tom Whitlow,
to try to infuse this process with
[SPEAKER_00]: research ideas and research education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I remember sitting at a
community meeting and one of the community
[SPEAKER_00]: members asking, you know, why a million
trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not trees and shrubs and, you know,
why not a variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chief naturalist said,
well, you know, when the mayor tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant a million trees, you plant a
million trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of, you know, so this
project is as much political as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologically driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe more political than
ecologically driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were really interested in the
questions about how do you construct an
[SPEAKER_00]: urban forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are the criteria that you
need to take into consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also really interested in the
role of analysis and research that one
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to do with enough
coordination up front on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed source, the influence of politics and
budget on performance, the issue of parks
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance practices and how that
influences design, the whole question that
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City has been asking about
community boards and kind of discrepancies
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of community board canopy cover,
and then local questions about public
[SPEAKER_00]: parks and urban forests about things like
species richness and the value of species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness or how to deal with invasive
species, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were lots of questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project was actually rather large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a combination of citywide,
how to plant, you know, a million trees
[SPEAKER_00]: across the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we were, the project was
split between the New York Restoration
[SPEAKER_00]: Project, who's doing implementation on
private land and street trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Parks Department doing work with
us on public parkland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were really looking only at public
parkland, not at street trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fundamentally different set of
drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at dominant vegetation and
pH and moisture levels as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: categorizing land types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had decided earlier on that we
would identify areas with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species, then we would replace
those with forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of our dilemmas was if we're
planting dense forests four feet on center
[SPEAKER_00]: across the city, what's that going to do
to the state of public access and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, parkland?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought it would be politically
strong to propose replacing invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of invasives in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we developed a series of
invasive management strategies for the
[SPEAKER_00]: project that we're all pretty intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were a kind of combination of
research ideas coupled with the Parks
[SPEAKER_00]: Department Natural Resources Group,
which is a subgroup within the Parks
[SPEAKER_00]: Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very unusual and sophisticated
group of practitioners that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this kind of work, at least at a
smaller scale, for about two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came up with a series of
species pallets, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: alkalinity, the hydrology of the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this process of site analysis
or site entitation, which is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: parks management practice, a fairly rapid
assessment of what's on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we made this work,
because we started talking about research
[SPEAKER_00]: as a component of the design from early on
from the first, actually from our response
[SPEAKER_00]: in the RFP and the first several meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But meeting after meeting, we would bring
up this idea of research as a component,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was conversations
like, you know, we don't necessarily know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the benefits of soil amendments are
going to be, whether it's going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for the plants that we've
planted over time, or whether it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually increase invasive species
recruitment patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're not quite sure what's
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, questions about species
richness, you know, whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be more, whether or not we'll
have more survival if we plant a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or less, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were certain things that we were
uncertain about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Parks Department was concerned
about those issues, but they had,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in this role where they had
incomplete information and had to make
[SPEAKER_00]: choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to frame the research
questions around the parks management
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions, where there's debated topics
in the literature, but the Parks
[SPEAKER_00]: Department has to take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we essentially developed a series
of research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, it builds on the flow of knowledge
with the, sorry, the biodiversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem functioning literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this here is a representative of the
BEF literature, and basically that
[SPEAKER_00]: information has made its way into the
public realm through a variety of means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say here, ecosystem services as
a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ecosystem services comes forward,
and it embodies the information and
[SPEAKER_00]: debated topics within BEF literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there are a lot of debates about the
value of species richness, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information then makes its way right
to the policy makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an idea that by increasing
canopy in an urban environment that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to increase ecological value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this influenced the urban
forest sciences where the U4 model,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and other models are used to
take information in, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look at, for example, the U4 model
doesn't incorporate species interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may be one of the fundamental
aspects of how this forest is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a number of assumptions that
make their way into the U4 model,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nonetheless, that influences decision
making about how many trees to plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: about what the benefits of these trees are
going to provide from a green
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure standpoint and a canopy
standpoint for the urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So policy makers then direct the Parks
Department to plant a million trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Parks Department, particularly the
Natural Resources Group, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, have experience planting trees
over the last 20 years, and so they are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take that on as an initiative and
move forward with it as an agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's missing is, or what's happening
is that a lot of the assumptions here are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting embedded in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we were trying to do at the
EDAW and now the UED lab is to link this
[SPEAKER_00]: together again by developing the million
trees project as a research project,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a long-term research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did we do city-wide
implementation, but we also identified
[SPEAKER_00]: pilot sites where we could develop
large-scale research as a component.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were worried about the slow pace of the
city-wide implementation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability across sites in the city,
and we wanted to have a couple discrete
[SPEAKER_00]: sites where we had a lot of replication
for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the old Queens Fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Willow Lake here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom is doing work on Willow Lake now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this area, as you mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is there, the MTA yard
adjacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a pretty interesting
hydrologically modified urban condition
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was talking to the Parks
Department about the notion, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the notion of using this as
a coastal adaptation management site
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's tide gates and it floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out there's a, this is what
I've heard, that there's a putt-putt owner
[SPEAKER_00]: just below that is the obstacle to
negotiating trying to reconstruct or to
[SPEAKER_00]: use this as a coastal adaptation,
just to show you some of the local
[SPEAKER_00]: politics that can get in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna talk today more about
Casino, which is located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The World's Fair is right there,
so it's actually a pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: linear ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Queens Botanical Garden is
adjacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's actually one of the
largest community gardens or the largest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a hospital here at Queens
Botanical Garden, East West International
[SPEAKER_00]: School.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've done is we've embedded a
series of research plots throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: parkland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of our agenda was to,
part of our goal was how do you design
[SPEAKER_00]: parkland that can accommodate research as
a component of the design and be part of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and be something that is bought into or
accepted within the public context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, the strategy was where
the research plots were surrounding it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we designed what I call the cluster
planting, which was essentially intended
[SPEAKER_00]: to modulate the grid of the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then outside of that, I actually
developed what I call the picturesque
[SPEAKER_00]: style, which goes back to the earlier
discussions that I was having about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not, my own debate,
am I a naturalistic designer or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ultimately, the picturesque served
as a kind of Trojan horse for the research
[SPEAKER_00]: plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interpretation was, okay,
this is a picturesque style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a typical urban parkland design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there weren't really many issues with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only about two weeks before we
actually planted the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staging was completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts manager and I turned to each
other and she said, no, what do we mean by
[SPEAKER_00]: the picturesque exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually sat down and talked
about 15 feet on center or 25 feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some sort of a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also planted LA trees along
pathways and desire lines and along
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational areas like ball fields to
essentially stitch, to create a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more mature landscape that the research
plantings, which were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: small at the time, could grow into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this was intentional as a
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it was designed as a research
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had soil amendment, no soil
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had high diversity, low diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also planted an understory
vegetation versus no understory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a seven by eight factorial with
56 plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went through and did a series of
sampling and vegetation biomass studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, to develop a better baseline
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're in the process of looking at
the second stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we've been
learning from this design experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which follows a model that I'm calling
build it and they will come, which is used
[SPEAKER_00]: in a variety of means, but essentially if
you build a good research project in an
[SPEAKER_00]: urban context with a lot of replication,
then the idea is will it attracts other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists to come and do their own
research on this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the example of the adaptive
experimentation from ASU where the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists there identified these circles
that were part of a military housing
[SPEAKER_00]: project that were all similar sized and
shaped and they had the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: houses around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an example of identifying a
research artifact in an urban context that
[SPEAKER_00]: has enough replication that you can set up
an experiment on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a different approach where you
kind of virally embed yourself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: design process and you construct these
research projects for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and giving people opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to this is that you get the
funding for the experimental design and
[SPEAKER_00]: the experimental construction were all
essentially paid for through public
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, the contractor who was
fantastic, it was a great way to build an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to have a contractor and his
entire crew go out and sort of establish
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the second half of the design
experiment that's still sort of a struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: because what you have is this constructed
experiment but the funding is not there
[SPEAKER_00]: for the monitoring component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you're going out and trying to
essentially sell the project to different
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies to fund the second half of this
experimental setup or this experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in that phase now looking at
questions like are constructed native
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and urban landscapes
sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in questioning whether they're
really, whether they're resilient in the
[SPEAKER_00]: face of a variety of urban stressors,
we've identified that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: drought is an issue that's already taken
place on our site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vandalism is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students that are in the schools adjacent
like to break the trees and use them as
[SPEAKER_00]: for sword fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some really interesting
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we spent, you know,
two years eradicating or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate mugwort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that the Asian population
living in this area like to spread mugwort
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's used for tea and for,
I think for sushi or other kinds of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually this kind of,
you know, back and forth between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going on in urban ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project itself included a wide
range of stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this is the role of the design
experiment is bringing the agenda of
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholder A in alignment or as a way of
furthering the goals of stakeholder B,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the Parks Department was
really looking for green infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: and biodiversity and habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a capital investment
component that was going into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, the scientists were looking for
ways of testing management assumptions and
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing manipulative experiments to
study these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the Parks and Recreation
Natural Resources Group are really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for evidence-based management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're looking for kind of quick
analysis and invasive species control
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the people like the Queens
Botanical Garden who are somewhat involved
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the Nathaniel Hawthorne Middle
School are looking for research and
[SPEAKER_00]: education opportunities, ways of getting
students involved in the process to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand their environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about this already a little bit,
the idea of the research plot adjacent to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cluster and the cluster adjacent to
the picturesque and the picturesque
[SPEAKER_00]: adjacent to the allay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just sort of the design drawings
that were used to negotiate the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an example of the plot
itself and the way we set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the research plot itself was
originally a grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the Parks Department
plants have planted several hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand trees in a four-foot on-center
grid, when we sent them the grid,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were troubled by kind of the way it
looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wanted us to kind of,
or they gave some pushback to rethink how
[SPEAKER_00]: we were organizing the species and what
our intentions were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Parks Department, they like to
plant in patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started taking on that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came up with what's actually
called the naturalistic plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was essentially an organization of
trees in patches or quadrats of similar
[SPEAKER_00]: species into these kind of clumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we reorganized the shrubs and
herbaceous on a different alignment to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of break down the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we actually realized was it
became a better experimental setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were able to ask questions at
the microplot scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now sampling in each one of these
quadrats and assessing the function or the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in soil microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as tree species performance of
these local clumped groups and able to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare clump A to clump B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turned out to be one of these
examples of a win-win situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sometimes hard to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the plots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with Mark Bradford,
who is a soil ecologist at Yale also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's really been active in analysis
of microbial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also working with Rich Hallett
from the US Forest Service on chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: and fluorescence to look at as a method of
assessing tree performance and tree health
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually found some preliminary
information, at least in this box plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that there are differences
between species on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this kind of,
I wouldn't call it yet a collaboration,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these outreach programs with local
school children who are coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to work with the Parks
Department and the school to come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: research that is doable on a short term
and meaningful to students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at things like cover
boards as a way of setting up a sample in
[SPEAKER_00]: practice for local school communities to
do their analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of this as a kind of applied
urban ecology that has a research
[SPEAKER_00]: aesthetic and it's designing an
experimental landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, I think it's starting to
bridge these fields of design and science
[SPEAKER_00]: as an approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it, as I mentioned before,
is the role of implementation and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: building these things so that you can
start to document all of the pitfalls and
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges of implementation over
time, which is what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my students recently did a life
cycle assessment of the project because
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the contractor kept notes on a
weekly basis which stacked about this high
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything that they did from the
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he looked at the different stages
of the process and how that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological function from a life cycle
assessment and found that the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: plantation process was really the biggest
consumer of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But invasive management, although you
can't always see that number for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, it was also pretty high,
it's a black one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his analysis suggested that
basically it's gonna take somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 11 to 41 years to pay back all the
energy input that went into implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: the Million Trees Project, at least on
Casina, if that's a case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is one of the arguments I
think being made about urban parkland
[SPEAKER_00]: afforestation practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the things that this doesn't
take into account are species
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, which is a kind of important
one, and a whole range of social human
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, you know, the value of having a
canopy or an urban forest in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been interested, Tom and I have
talked about this before, of looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because of the Asian longhorn
beetle and some of the other constraints,
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant pallet options were limited,
and so we planted a lot of oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oaks give off volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting them adjacent to roadways,
you know, you could get some mixing of
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust with these VOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's basic questions about what
it is that we're doing and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: implications of what we're doing are gonna
have over time in terms of ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: services or ecosystem benefits that really
need to be evaluated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Tom can attest, it's kind of a
difficult effort to try to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: turbulent dynamics of that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I wanted to briefly, how am I
doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let me end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, join me in thanking Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
