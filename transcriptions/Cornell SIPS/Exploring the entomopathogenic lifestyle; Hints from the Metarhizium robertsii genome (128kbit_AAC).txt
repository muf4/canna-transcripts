[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm part of a research group that is
very much interested in entomomorphogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, in particular secondary metabolism
of this group of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why this interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the main reason is because these
fungi are used in biological control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about control, it's a kind of reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite of the interest that
plant pathologists usually have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to know how to kill
something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant pathologists are more interested in
how to protect plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, what we both
would like to know is how our favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: organism works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what makes it virulent?
[SPEAKER_00]: And dangerous or beneficial in our case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just three quotes I would say
about biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, we want something that
is more virulent to control better our
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to have our biocontrol agent
to be more resilient in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to avoid collateral damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do not kill what we do not intend
to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also not to kill who uses this
biocontrol agent, like the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some biocontrol agents may produce toxic
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I was talking to you about,
before we are interested in metarhizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to relate to you a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phylogenetic tree is described
[SPEAKER_00]: as a biocontrol agent.
And it's a biocontrol agent.
And this is a biocontrol agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this here red, you will see also
some green things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the claviceps epicoid clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, these are relegate fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably were ethyl pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they reverse back to the plants,
either as plant pathogens or are entified
[SPEAKER_00]: of grasses in the case of epicoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bear a lot of resemblance to
metarhizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we focus on this organism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why metarhizium robertsii?
[SPEAKER_00]: This species, and particularly this
strain, is one of the most studied
[SPEAKER_00]: entomopathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others, but this is for sure one
that has the highest interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generalized entomopathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I forgot to mention is that
among these entomopathogens, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many, many times, you can see just a
preference towards some insects versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy infects about 700 different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what's reported in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more sensitive than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sexual stage, it's known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rarely observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called metachordyceps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just never seen just a picture on
the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are dealing with basically collegial
reproduction in most of the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the molecular basis of the elements
are being explored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know something about this guy,
but not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I forgot to turn this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a customer, I should talk to you
about the life cycle of metarhizium,
[SPEAKER_00]: how this guy infects its hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this life cycle is really,
really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with a collegial ending on this
little fella, this larva, and germinating,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a germ tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penetration structure goes through the
cuticle, the insect skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the difference between this cuticle
and the plant cuticle is that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really thick and is a cellular and
is made mostly of proteins and chiving,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-linked many times with some phenols
and can be as stuff as a shrink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be really tough, not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its primary target, the primary target
of metarhizium is the emocytic cavity and
[SPEAKER_00]: the anemolith, basically the insect blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it reaches the insect blood,
it switches, this is a morphogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes from filamentous to yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: These yeast-like forms are called blaster
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they disseminate these fungus
throughout the emocytic cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost works as a blood infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't target, as far as we know,
any specific organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes throughout the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to put it simply, it simply kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, when the insect is dead,
the fungus outgrows, grows back outside on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the insect, and it's
correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see these mummies covered in this,
in case of, there is your green stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of gruesome to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cycle starts again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have sequenced the genome of this
particular organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to talk about,
you are just a few specific pieces of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly these two topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is about carbon source preference and
toxin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there is something about,
well, this is an important topic that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to touch about today,
because it would require too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I wouldn't, detection by the
immune system is also kind of important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to show you something about this,
this fungus, the genome of these fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, this slide is to tell you about the
fact that this is just an average
[SPEAKER_00]: astromycetes, a genome of 40 megabases,
and has a number of gene models,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein coding models, 12,400.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's more or less what you expect
we have from now.
Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal during, our goal during this work
is to try to understand what makes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes metarhizium and metarhizium,
what is the difference between metarhizium
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do this comparison, I felt,
we felt that we need to have a large panel
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungi to basically refer to the more
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the list of 48 fungi and four
bacteria that I used throughout the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although this has to be taken with a
little bit of caution, because many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these fungi are, yes, plant pathogen,
but they can be opportunistic animal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some entomopathogens show endophagal
capabilities and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very rough classification of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we look at the, one way to
represent what's peculiar within a genome
[SPEAKER_00]: is just to find a relative abundance of
some protein classes, some functional
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, like proteins, carbohydrate
acting enzymes, secondary metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showing the relative abundance like
that, as in this case, metarhizium is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly enriched in proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting in itself, but it doesn't
tell the entire story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make you, allow you to make
contrast and compare and tell what set
[SPEAKER_00]: these fungus apart, if anything,
from other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just gene composition and protein
potential or the way these proteins are
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to show to you,
it's something I, a technique that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trying to use and then suddenly I
found that other people are trying to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I was pleased that I was on the right
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the use of principal component
analysis to reorganize these proteins and
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to correlate their presence with
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So principal component analysis is just
for you to know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to reduce the dimensionality of
your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with, in this case, 29 dimension
trying to define lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And principal component makes a linear
combination of these variable and produces
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what are called latent variables
or components that allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize these very complex problems in
a simpler fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interpretation is a little bit different,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that these 29 protein classes
have been summarizing two components that
[SPEAKER_00]: Harbor explains, sorry, about 60% of the
entire variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is remarkable is just using PCA on
those groups I showed you before just as a
[SPEAKER_00]: relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that, for example,
the entomopathogen tend to group,
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to stay close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant pathogen tend to be here in this
other side of the plot and here there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some animal pathogens in the east.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, just dealing with the
relative abundance of some protein
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, you can reorganize and describe a
little bit lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect because as I told you,
also our classification of lifestyle is
[SPEAKER_00]: very rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: An alternative way to do this,
to look at this on the other side is that
[SPEAKER_00]: before we cluster, we put together the,
we use basically just the independent
[SPEAKER_00]: variables to where protein classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, using hierarchical clustering
analysis, you can do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cluster the variables,
but also you can cluster, see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: affect clustering of your data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you don't need to look too carefully
at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just look at, there is a dendrogram
here and there are bands basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see is that just using
graphical classification, peptidases,
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate, hydrolysis, this fungi can be
grouped together a little bit like in PCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the entomopathogens
grouped here as they were grouped before
[SPEAKER_00]: using the PCA plot because they share more
or less same kind of relative composition
[SPEAKER_00]: of these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are most of the plant pathogens and
some saprops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are bacteria that are completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are almost an output.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one entomopathogen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is always a little bit of an
outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there are some animal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice way to, at a glance,
tell apart stuff, tell apart species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was quite, I mean, I was really
surprised that it didn't work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if, oh, let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get to analyze some subgroups,
for example, like lipase and glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysis, and look at the families
within this larger group, family of
[SPEAKER_00]: lipases, you can see that the story
repeats itself and the entomopathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to again cluster together and plant
pathogens are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more, if you look at glyphosate,
hydrolysis, this phenomenon is even more
[SPEAKER_00]: marked.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at polysaccharide active
enzymes analyzed using principal component
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, you can see how separated these
species are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the bacteria, yeasts,
animal pathogens, entomopathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-parasites, plant pathogens,
and saprops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more explanatory is the other
phase, the other side of the analysis that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be conducted with hierarchical
clustering, which you can see also better
[SPEAKER_00]: how these fungi clusters together when you
use these many, many glycoside,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysis, and the other carbohydrate
active enzyme as a clustering variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see how these clusters
are organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost see the bands here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How some bovaria, sorry, some
entomopathogens are clustered together and
[SPEAKER_00]: they both miss some things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have instead more of something
else that you cannot read because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how the reverse is true for some plant
pattern, for the plant pathogens are down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While, as expected, the yeasts have almost
nothing, very little of hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is for the animal,
some animal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look and zoom in and try to
understand what's more and what's less,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are these holes here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You discover a very interesting thing that
you could not discover just with
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment analysis, is that most of the
families that they've been missing in
[SPEAKER_00]: mepharism and in other entomopathogenic
fungi belong to these glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can read what they do usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, this is a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what's missing there are
enzymes, carbohydrate active enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: they degrade encephalosis and the
peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I wonder, is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have anything to do with reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really so bad at growing up?
[SPEAKER_00]: This substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you see, if you look and compare
gibberella and methalizium robertsia on
[SPEAKER_00]: polygalactronica, basically this pectin,
this demethylated pectin, you can see how
[SPEAKER_00]: methalizium robertsia after seven days
grows relatively bad compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on just glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the culture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's methalizium glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on polygalactronica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same amount of glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1% and 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it barely grows there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same on hemicellulosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fuchsianum grameannum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now to be able to grow on these
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells, distinguishes methalizium and
other entomopathogens from the bulk of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, subgroups and special pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is something that also they have
the other fungi won't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been said over and over that they are
very rich in methalizium and
[SPEAKER_00]: entomopathogens, very rich in peptidases
and chitinases, which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of them and they needed to
penetrate through the thick cuticle I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also triglycerma is out of those
peptidases and glucinases and is not an
[SPEAKER_00]: insect pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what is interesting is that just
a regression in triglycerma, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: this swath of chitinases have been shown
not to participate very much in
[SPEAKER_00]: microparasites, something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: What methalizium and some other
entomopathogens have the other fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually not all, is these three classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These basically release monomers from
animal carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you something about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are single genes that they have and
entomopathogens have and other fungi won't
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a single gene can make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems to be acquired by a result of
gene transfer because it's very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: some bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to animal poly,
sorry, hyaluronorase lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting because these are
pathogenesis factor in, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial, animal bacterial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, in Staphylococcus,
and there was another one, deletion of
[SPEAKER_00]: single PL8 just knocks it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much less violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown that these enzymes
basically facilitate penetration and
[SPEAKER_00]: spread of these bacteria and provide also
monomers from hyaluronorate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that enzyme, it looks like they
don't do very well in connected tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something I told you about what
is the preference of methalizium and other
[SPEAKER_00]: entomopathogenic fungi regarding
carbohydrates that are very important
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing we would like to know is how
does methalizium affect and kill itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the pathogenicity factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell you that we don't know
very much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hints I would discuss to you about
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the framework here is a classic
paradigm that reminds the difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: that reminds the bio-growth and natural
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been said that some entomopathogens
are stealth attackers, so they penetrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sit there, they are not recognized,
they grow, and then where the biomass is
[SPEAKER_00]: too large, they basically, the insect dies
for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is a kind of shock and awe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus penetrates and immediately
kills the host and grows on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sure what really happens,
but we know there's probably something in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: One remarkable thing that the genome tells
us is that these genomes are enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: homologs of bacterial toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually these bacterial toxins,
bacterial toxins, what I mean is animal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, bacteria that are animal
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they are multimeric, they have
multiple subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find in entomopathogens are just
some of the subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really clear what the role is or
what their action and function is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's remarkable to see these maybe in
all these genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their similarity with bacterial toxins
is low, but significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, in most cases,
only some of these subunits are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: entomopathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a breakdown or a summary
of what these toxins do in insect,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a plethora of really nasty
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you talk about entomotoxins found in
Vibrio cholerae, in escherichia coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pertussis toxins is an immunosuppressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diphtheria toxin also is a nice,
not very nice toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is botox.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see in neurotoxin they basically
inhibit the release of acetylcholine and
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has characterized them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are particularly present in
entomopathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at their distribution,
there's something kind of interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, they are typical of this
group of entomopathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look carefully, there are some
fungi that are completely devoid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some, like Mario Porto, even
Cochleoblos, sometimes they have one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two copies of some of them and it's not
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But entomopathogens have lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, in their composition assessment,
it's not the same for all entomopathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is present in Bavaria tends to be
less present in M.E.V.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the expression,
we have some transcriptome data and the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of these toxins inside the B.D
.R.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: worm that is an insect host, we see that
some are upregulated compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: axemic culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be much lower, express a much
lower level or not expressed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One particular specific bacterial life
toxin has been recently characterized in
[SPEAKER_00]: epicloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to insect toxins and
when it's been expressed or expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, in fact, to actually inject it
in insects, it was demonstrated this toxin
[SPEAKER_00]: is toxic and has an insecticidal
capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I said before, one of the things we
are interested in the most in this fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: is secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does secondary metabolism have a role in
entomopathy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have to go back in time a little
bit and tell you that until relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, this particular compound
extracts in the example, known ribosomally
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized peptide was considered
detoxing of M.E.V.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mildly insecticidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced by some strain in vitro in
sometimes large amounts and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated to the preference of the
pathogen, which means that usually insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more sensitive to this toxin have
been shown to be even more sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, this is the toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have characterized, knocked out
the genes for the synthetics for all these
[SPEAKER_00]: three, all these three compounds,
basically M minus strings for each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically none of them made any
difference in the appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are as spewed, I would say,
as lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you can hardly see any difference
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, going back to the genome,
what we know is that the fungus is really
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded with secondary metabolite pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has many BKS hybrids and ribosomal
peptide synthetases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a long way to go to rule out
the participation of secondary metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: to any facets of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true that many, many, many of these
pathways are unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But metalism also shows that there are a
few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is just two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tantalized similarities to known
secondary metabolite pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ergot by synthetic gene cluster
in claviceps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a gene cluster that is very
similar in metalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is this other pathway that is
almost identical in Penicillium etiopica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been characterized,
produces a tetracycline like compound
[SPEAKER_00]: that's antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the rest, it's really difficult to
make sense of what they might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, oops, I don't know what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to.
Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and if you compare the expression of
many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: two, you can hardly spot a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a time course of the expression
of mass majority of NRPS and BKS NRPS
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so time course is between 24 hours of
the infection and 120 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the inoculated control,
the inoculated insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the GDNA control, just to see if
you can see how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's in axelic culture and in
chlamydia.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a good amplification from insect is
kind of hard, because the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects in the fungus tends to be low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see whatever is expressed in
vivo is expressed in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever is not expressed in vivo is
not expressed in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little bit disappointing for
us, because we really like secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is another way to, a quick and
dirty way to have a rough idea of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolism does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the deletion of these PPTAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: PPTAs are required to activate,
basically, most of the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite genes, NRPS and PKSs,
not the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these genes, these proteins
are inactive because they cannot have the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphopanthenic modification of the
distillation domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, they are there,
but they are not functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you remove the right
phosphopanthenic transferase, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you have is that all NRPS and PKSs
are not functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what you have is lysine isotropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what happens is that the fungus
is not able to synthesize lysine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't produce siderophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, part of the
secondary metabolism is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, how is the PPT1 mutant looks
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This wild type pigmented is completely
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the knockout work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this basic group to the
mortality, to the survival in time of
[SPEAKER_00]: insect, really, in one time, at this level
of inoculum, you have the base 7,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of the insect are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: With PPT1 mutant, there is almost no
mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PPT1 mutants are nearly non-virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we do those responses,
we can assess the potency of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is that using those responses,
you can calculate how much inoculum you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to kill 50% of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a rough calculation tells for the wild
type, you need alpha-medial, connedia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perunial to kill half of the
population in this particular condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: while for PPT1 mutant, you need 25 times
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very much alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need 25 times more connedia to,
in theory, to get to the same old town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this presentation, I try to present
to you information about nepharism and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the genome tells us on its ability to
survive and what the villain's factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially toxin, can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conclusion is that maternism of Bersia
has expanded refer to our peptidases,
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites, and enzymes that
allows it to thrive on animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very less adapted to survival plant,
which was a surprise, compared to other
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the secondary metabolism is
required for pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what this is on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what is characteristic is the large
amount of bacterial-like toxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: for which we don't have any idea of
function, and have not been characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: by anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, I would like to
acknowledge and thank people from my lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and my unit and collaborators,
who we talked to and we worked with in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And special thanks to William for their
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, I will take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
