[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, it's 9.01.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome again, everyone, to our Cornell
Hemp Research Team Virtual Field Day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a beautiful day here in upstate New
York, and I wish you all could be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would have had a perfect day in the
field.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm going to look at the silver
lining, and that is that we are now up to
[SPEAKER_13]: two hundred and thirteen attendees already
matching what we had last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was our max capacity of our field
facilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also been able to encourage the
participation of people across the country
[SPEAKER_13]: and perhaps around the world through this
virtual format.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're going to have a broader
impact.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a good lineup of speakers today.
[SPEAKER_13]: We you see, we've broken up the session,
the program into three sessions,
[SPEAKER_13]: the first one on hemp breeding and
genetics, second on crop management and
[SPEAKER_13]: the third on supply chains and regulatory
updates.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of those presentations will be made
live.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some are pre-recorded and I will play
those through my computer.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've allowed a five minute break at the
end of each hour because we've realized
[SPEAKER_13]: now with these long Zoom meetings that
people need to take a break for a few
[SPEAKER_13]: minutes, get a cup of coffee, use the
restroom, etc.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I also want to thank our support from
Pixis International and some of my
[SPEAKER_13]: colleagues from Pixis are on as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have sponsored our research now for
the second season and have made a strong
[SPEAKER_13]: commitment to extension and outreach to
hemp growers across the country.
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I want to thank them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So without further ado, I'm going to turn
the screen over to my graduate student,
[SPEAKER_13]: George Stack, who has started in second
year of his PhD, who is going to give you
[SPEAKER_13]: a presentation about some of our
cannabinoid hemp trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: George.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: Can everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_20]: Larry, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear you well.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can see my screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: As Larry said, my name is George Stack and
I'm starting the second year of my PhD in
[SPEAKER_19]: his lab at Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today I'm going to be talking to you about
our high cannabinoid hemp cultivar trials
[SPEAKER_19]: from 2019 and 2020.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before I kind of dig in, I'd like to bring
up two points.
[SPEAKER_19]: One is that I have posted two fact sheets
on our website, one about the 2019 trial
[SPEAKER_19]: and one about the 2020 trial.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's data that I'm going to be
presenting in this talk as well as
[SPEAKER_19]: additional data that you can check out
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the second thing I'd like to bring up
is that when I talk about THC in this
[SPEAKER_19]: talk, I'm talking about total THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a regulatory issue that I don't
really have time to dig into right now,
[SPEAKER_19]: but we'll hopefully discuss it later in
the field day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_19]: So before I talk about the data,
we need to understand why different
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis plants accumulate different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it comes down to this cannabinoid
biosynthetic pathway right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to put my pointer on.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're starting with these precursor
compounds that get converted into CBGA.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the CBGA can get converted into
either CBDA by the CBDA synthase enzyme in
[SPEAKER_19]: the plant or THCA by the THCA synthase
enzyme in the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the combination of these two enzymes
that a plant has really dictate what
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabinoids it's going to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can imagine if we have a THCA
synthase enzyme, but no CBDA synthase
[SPEAKER_19]: enzyme, the plant will accumulate THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is called chemotype one.
[SPEAKER_19]: If we have both a THCA synthase enzyme and
a CBDA synthase enzyme will accumulate
[SPEAKER_19]: both CBDA and THCA, this is called
chemotype two.
[SPEAKER_19]: If we have just a CBDA synthase enzyme and
no THCA synthase enzyme will accumulate
[SPEAKER_19]: CBD, this is called chemotype three.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we have neither a CBDA synthase
enzyme nor a THCA synthase enzyme will
[SPEAKER_19]: accumulate CBG.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is how you get these high CBG
varieties.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is called chemotype four.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's look at this in the context of
our 2019 CBD cultivar trial.
[SPEAKER_19]: This trial was replicated at two sites,
one in Geneva and one in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_19]: At each of these sites, we had 30
cultivars replicated.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so one of the questions that we can
ask about the trial is what chemotypes
[SPEAKER_19]: showed up in this 2019 trial?
[SPEAKER_19]: Were all of the plants chemotype three
high CBD plants, as we would expect if
[SPEAKER_19]: we're trying to produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the answer to that question is no.
[SPEAKER_19]: So at least seven of the 30 cultivars were
not all chemotype three.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is some cannabinoid data from one
cultivar that had chemotypes one,
[SPEAKER_19]: two and three individuals in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that the chemotype one and
chemotype two individuals accumulated a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot of THC and exceeded the regulatory
threshold.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a real problem that growers are
being sold chemotype one and two plants
[SPEAKER_19]: when they're expecting chemotype three
plants and it causes them to be not
[SPEAKER_19]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_19]: The second question that we asked was how
do cannabinoids accumulate over time?
[SPEAKER_19]: And we did this by taking shoot tip
samples weekly after terminal flowering
[SPEAKER_19]: for all of the 30 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we look at the data, it looks
like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's look at CBD accumulation over
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have total potential CBD on our y-axis
here, and we have weeks after terminal
[SPEAKER_19]: flowering on our x-axis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Each of these lines is a different one of
the cultivars and shows how it accumulates
[SPEAKER_19]: CBD over time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see that for most cultivars,
they accumulate quite a lot of CBD in the
[SPEAKER_19]: weeks immediately following terminal
flowering.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this makes sense because most of the
cannabinoids are concentrated in the
[SPEAKER_19]: trichomes of the female flowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's really interesting though is when
you compare this graph of CBD accumulation
[SPEAKER_19]: to the graph of THC accumulation.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll just flip back and forth between
these slides a few times here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that the curves for each
of the cultivars are almost identical.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just that the scales are different.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the scale for the CBD graph was zero to
20, and the scale for this THC graph is
[SPEAKER_19]: zero to 0.6.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason the curves are so similar
is because CBD and THC accumulation are
[SPEAKER_19]: coupled in high CBD plants at a fixed
ratio.
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, that means these
cultivars here that accumulated high
[SPEAKER_19]: levels of CBD also accumulated enough THC
to be above this 0.3% total THC legal
[SPEAKER_19]: threshold, which leaves us a very small
window to do regulatory testing and
[SPEAKER_19]: harvest before our cultivars become not
compliant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we look at this CBD to THC ratio
across all of our cultivars, we have CBD
[SPEAKER_19]: to THC ratio on our y-axis here,
our cultivars on our x-axis.
[SPEAKER_19]: We see that it's pretty consistent for
most cultivars between a 20 to 1 ratio and
[SPEAKER_19]: 30 to 1 ratio, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that means that at a 0.3% total THC
threshold, on average, we can only
[SPEAKER_19]: accumulate about seven to 8% total CBD
before a plant becomes not compliant.
[SPEAKER_19]: The third thing I'd like to talk about is
when these plants flower and the variation
[SPEAKER_19]: in flowering time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in this graph here, you can see our
cultivars on the y-axis and the date on
[SPEAKER_19]: the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_19]: This vertical line is when we
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that these bars indicate
when each of the cultivars flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had some that flowered in June,
some in July, some in August, some in
[SPEAKER_19]: September, and one even in October.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've added these circle x's to show
when these cultivars exceeded the 0.3%
[SPEAKER_19]: total THC legal threshold.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that it's very strongly
correlated and has this one to maybe four
[SPEAKER_19]: week window between terminal flowering and
exceeding the THC threshold for most
[SPEAKER_19]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in summary, I'm going to talk about
considerations for staying THC compliant
[SPEAKER_19]: when growing for CBD.
[SPEAKER_19]: The first thing we talked about were the
different chemotypes of cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_19]: when we're producing CBD, we really want
chemotype three plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: The second thing we talked about was the
cannabinoid accumulation curves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm going to stress the importance
of regular testing to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_19]: know where you are on that curve and that
you're staying under the 0.3% legal
[SPEAKER_19]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the third thing I mentioned was that
flowering was very strongly correlated
[SPEAKER_19]: with cannabinoid accumulation,
which makes sense because cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_19]: accumulated in the trichomes of the female
flowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So monitoring flowering time is a really
good management strategy for staying under
[SPEAKER_19]: that THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I'm going to briefly talk about our
cultivar trials from this year.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have a CBD cultivar trial and a CBG
cultivar trial.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is chemotype three and chemotype
four.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we've replicated at two sites,
one in Geneva and one in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to circle around here,
in Geneva, we have a CBD trial with 40
[SPEAKER_19]: different cultivars in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also have a CBG trial with 12
different cultivars in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And over here in Ithaca, we have a
replicated CBD trial with 32 of the
[SPEAKER_19]: cultivars in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also have a direct seeded essential
oil hemp trial, which is a multi-state
[SPEAKER_19]: trial organized by Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this has nine cultivars in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll just share some preliminary data
here from our CBD and CBG cultivar trials.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as of Monday, 21 of the 52 cultivars
have started to terminally flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've represented that flowering time
in this plot over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is called a violin plot and it
shows the distribution of flowering over
[SPEAKER_19]: the course of the last two months.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see that some cultivars seem
to have several distinct groups of
[SPEAKER_19]: flowering time, some early, some late,
several appear to flower just over the
[SPEAKER_19]: course of multiple weeks, but not be
really separated into groups.
[SPEAKER_19]: And some all flower very consistently at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it'll be interesting to see how these
cultivars continue to mature over the rest
[SPEAKER_19]: of the growing season and how the other 31
cultivars that haven't flowered yet will
[SPEAKER_19]: fit into this plot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll just say thank you to all of the
people who contributed to this research
[SPEAKER_19]: and our funding sources.
[SPEAKER_19]: Please put your questions in the chat and
I'd be happy to answer them.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is my contact info if you'd like
to talk more about hemp.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, George.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to try to get on time here and
make sure that my sharing of the videos
[SPEAKER_13]: here is working.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have time for Q&A at the end of the
session.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the hour.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there will be plenty of time
for George to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's my pleasure now to introduce Jacob
Toth, another PhD student in my lab,
[SPEAKER_13]: who will give you a complimentary talk on
our molecular breeding for a compliant
[SPEAKER_13]: fiber type.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello and welcome everybody to the Cornell
Hemp Field Days.
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Jacob Toth and I'm a PhD
candidate in Larry's smart lab.
[SPEAKER_18]: And today I'll be talking about molecular
breeding of hemp.
[SPEAKER_18]: For my talk today, I'll be discussing some
of the theory and ideas behind molecular
[SPEAKER_18]: breeding of hemp and give an example of
how we're using molecular breeding in our
[SPEAKER_18]: research program to develop a high
yielding fiber cultivar that has low
[SPEAKER_18]: levels of THC to stay compliant,
as well as produces high levels of CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is important to recognize the
contribution of genetics and environment
[SPEAKER_18]: to your trade of interest for any breeding
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_18]: So how the plant grows, the phenotype,
is the result of both the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_18]: plant as well as the environment.
[SPEAKER_18]: The genetics of the plant, also known as
the genotype, refers to the DNA of the
[SPEAKER_18]: plants, the genes and other DNA which make
up the plant's genome.
[SPEAKER_18]: So many important traits such as yield are
heavily influenced by both the genotype
[SPEAKER_18]: and the environment, but some traits such
as photoperiod dependence and
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabidotype are heavily influenced by
genotype alone.
[SPEAKER_18]: Concerning photoperiod dependence,
if you look at this picture here,
[SPEAKER_18]: the small plant is photoperiod independent
and started flowering almost immediately
[SPEAKER_18]: after planting, while the larger plant,
which is photoperiod dependence,
[SPEAKER_18]: didn't start flowering until the night
length hit a certain threshold.
[SPEAKER_18]: So another important trait that is
influenced heavily by genotype in cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: is cannabinoid type, and breeding for
cannabinoid type is a fundamental part of
[SPEAKER_18]: any hemp breeding.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is molecular breeding?
[SPEAKER_18]: So in molecular breeding, very broadly,
instead of just looking at the genotype of
[SPEAKER_18]: the plant, which is the result of both the
genotype and the environment, you look at
[SPEAKER_18]: the actual DNA.
[SPEAKER_18]: So advances in molecular biology have
allowed much easier analysis of DNA,
[SPEAKER_18]: and because the DNA is the same in every
cell of a plant, whether it's young or
[SPEAKER_18]: whether it's old, being able to assay a
plant just by looking at the DNA allows
[SPEAKER_18]: you to look at certain traits before
they're even expressed.
[SPEAKER_18]: For instance, to determine if a plant is
going to be male or female, or if it's
[SPEAKER_18]: going to produce mostly THC or mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: So with molecular breeding, you can
develop new cultivars based on the
[SPEAKER_18]: genotype alone, and when done accurately,
this can result in less expensive
[SPEAKER_18]: phenotyping and ultimately reducing the
cost and reducing the time it takes to
[SPEAKER_18]: develop a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit about
how our research group is using molecular
[SPEAKER_18]: breeding to develop new, elite,
high-yielding fiber cultivars that have
[SPEAKER_18]: compliant levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: In 2019, we grew several varieties for
grain and fiber production, including two
[SPEAKER_18]: cultivars from China called Dama and Puma.
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't know much about these cultivars
when we first planted them, aside from a
[SPEAKER_18]: little blurb for Puma, which claimed to
have high CBD seeds, high leaves,
[SPEAKER_18]: and flowers output.
[SPEAKER_18]: When these plants were grown, we were
quite impressed by the plants in that they
[SPEAKER_18]: had extremely large leaves and extremely
fast growth rate and would routinely hit
[SPEAKER_18]: 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_18]: When we harvested these plants and readed
them to measure the fiber yields,
[SPEAKER_18]: we found that Dama and Puma had nearly
double the biomass yield of other elite
[SPEAKER_18]: cultivars grown for fiber.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of this, we thought that Dama and
Puma would make excellent fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_18]: However, when we looked at the
cannabinoids, we found that both Puma and
[SPEAKER_18]: Dama produced THC at levels exceeding 0.3%
and would be non-compliant in the modern
[SPEAKER_18]: regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked further at the cannabinoids that
Puma and Dama were producing, and we found
[SPEAKER_18]: that they were relatively high in
cannabinoids, with Puma producing a little
[SPEAKER_18]: over 1.5% total cannabinoids, and Dama
sometimes exceeding 2% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is considerably higher than what
other fiber cultivars produced in terms of
[SPEAKER_18]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, we sampled these plants when
they were just starting to flower,
[SPEAKER_18]: so we hypothesized that as the plant
became more mature, the total cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_18]: would increase even further.
[SPEAKER_18]: However, the big problem was that Puma and
Dama produced THC at levels as a major
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabinoid, which isn't what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_18]: So ultimately, what we would like in a
cultivar would be something that produces
[SPEAKER_18]: as much dry biomass as Puma and Dama,
but instead of producing THC, produces
[SPEAKER_18]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: And to achieve that goal, we turned to
molecular breeding.
[SPEAKER_18]: So to understand what we did for molecular
breeding, it's first important to
[SPEAKER_18]: understand the different chemotypes that
are found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are three important chemotypes
that I'll talk about right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's type 1, which is mostly THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's type 2, which is CBD to THC at
about a 2 to 1 ratio, but this number can
[SPEAKER_18]: vary.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's type 3, which produces
mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're growing a population or a
cultivar for CBD, you'd expect all the
[SPEAKER_18]: plants to be type 3.
[SPEAKER_18]: But in 2018 and 2019, we found that some
of the plants that we were growing were in
[SPEAKER_18]: fact type 2 or even type 1, producing
almost no CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: Using this data and this figure in the top
here shows data from 2018, we developed a
[SPEAKER_18]: molecular marker which looks at the DNA of
the plants and can distinguish type 1 from
[SPEAKER_18]: type 2 and type 3 plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: So getting back to Dama and Puma,
when we were looking at the THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_18]: ratio for these plants, we saw that it was
about a 2 to 1 ratio of CBD to THC,
[SPEAKER_18]: which would suggest that most of the
plants that we were sampling were type 2.
[SPEAKER_18]: So an interesting thing about these type 2
plants is that they won't breed true.
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's a population which is freely
intercrossing with a lot of these type 2
[SPEAKER_18]: plants, you'd expect to see a certain
number to be type 1 and a certain number
[SPEAKER_18]: to be type 3.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we didn't have the HPLC, the chemical
data on a lot of different plants from
[SPEAKER_18]: Dama and Puma.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were just looking at pooled samples.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we could apply this molecular marker
to these populations and distinguish the
[SPEAKER_18]: different plants that were in these
different chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_18]: So late last year, around December,
we grew about 100 plants each of Dama and
[SPEAKER_18]: Puma and tested them with this marker that
we developed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And as expected, we found that about half
of the plants were type 2.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we found that about a third of the
plants were type 3.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the remainder were type 1.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we did was we selected the type 3.
[SPEAKER_18]: And in theory, these plants should form an
excellent basis for a high producing fiber
[SPEAKER_18]: cultivar that produces mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: However, after selection of these type 3
plants, we run into a few problems with
[SPEAKER_18]: their propagation.
[SPEAKER_18]: So these plants, which are so vigorous in
the field, are also very vigorous in a
[SPEAKER_18]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they grew extremely fast and extremely
tall, sometimes an axis of 14 feet.
[SPEAKER_18]: They were also quite susceptible to
various greenhouse pathogens, such as
[SPEAKER_18]: thrips and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_18]: To make matters worse, they appear to be
very photoperiod dependent and did not
[SPEAKER_18]: flower in the greenhouse in the spring
when we were growing them.
[SPEAKER_18]: There were also some issues with the
cutting propagation.
[SPEAKER_18]: These plants form a very nice single stem,
as you can see in this photo here.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not always simple to take a
cutting and root that very nice stem.
[SPEAKER_18]: So to address this, we're attempting to
grow the plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've planted them out and hopefully we'll
harvest some grain at the end of the
[SPEAKER_18]: season, which will form a good basis for
scale up.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've also sent the cuttings of these
plants to a collaborator in Florida who
[SPEAKER_18]: should be able to grow the plants without
any issue.
[SPEAKER_18]: In summary, molecular breeding involves
selection on the genotype on the DNA
[SPEAKER_18]: directly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bama and Puma, two cultivars from China,
are high biomass producers, but they
[SPEAKER_18]: produce high non-compliant levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: Selection in Bama and Puma for chemotype 3
plants using a molecular marker should
[SPEAKER_18]: produce a high yielding compliant fiber
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_18]: These plants here growing in the field in
New York should form the basis of a new
[SPEAKER_18]: compliant fiber cultivar.
[SPEAKER_18]: We hope to harvest the seeds at the end of
the season, scale them up, ensure that the
[SPEAKER_18]: resulted plants have the same biomass
potential as the parent Bama and Puma
[SPEAKER_18]: populations, and eventually potentially
release new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks very much, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are now going to switch to my postdoc,
Craig Carlson, who is out at the field in
[SPEAKER_13]: one of our breeding trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Craig is going to talk about some F1
hybrids that he has produced and show you
[SPEAKER_13]: some of their traits.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty, Larry, can you see me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Craig Carlson.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a postdoc with Cornell Hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: I work on breeding genetics and genomics
of hemp, and I've got Chris Smart here
[SPEAKER_11]: with me recording, and we are more than
six feet apart.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get this thing rolling.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you've been with the hemp industry
for about three or four years,
[SPEAKER_11]: you'll know that there is a big need for
cultivar development.
[SPEAKER_11]: For many years, we've seen uniformity in
the field in grain and fiber cultivars,
[SPEAKER_11]: but we've also seen a lot of issues with
uniformity in high cannabinoid cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're standing in our breeding and
selection trial right now, and this trial
[SPEAKER_11]: consists of 24 families.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's owned by Stem Holdings.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been kind of our model hemp plant for
the past three or four years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So typically, when we conduct these high
cannabinoid trials, we'll space plants
[SPEAKER_11]: about four feet apart and have about
six-foot alleys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do weekly measurements of plants,
plant height, we'll look at leaf area,
[SPEAKER_11]: branching angle, number of nodes within
the canopy, plant canopy width,
[SPEAKER_11]: and so we can get a nice shape descriptor
for those individuals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I've seen is really
lacking in the literature,
[SPEAKER_11]: is shape descriptors that are very basic,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So tree form, globe shape, columnar,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of these families have been crossed
with TJ or an inbred S1 or S2 of TJ.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I wanna show you is how some of these
phenotypes are segregating in these
[SPEAKER_11]: families, because TJ is actually quite
heterozygous, but the parents are
[SPEAKER_11]: heterozygous to more inbred.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanna show you kind of what our
important traits are doing in the field
[SPEAKER_11]: and the differences between crossing
heterozygous with heterozygous and
[SPEAKER_11]: heterozygous with inbred material.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can get Chris to move over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This row right here is a TJ.
[SPEAKER_11]: TJ is S2, meaning that we selfed TJs using
STS to produce pollen, silver thiosulfate,
[SPEAKER_11]: selected an individual and then selfed
that progeny from that individual.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's an S2 population.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I was going for with this family
was to select an S1 that looked a lot more
[SPEAKER_11]: like the parent.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we are finding out, what we have
found out is that TJ is actually
[SPEAKER_11]: heterozygous for a flowering time gene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is an S2 family in this row.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we see is that a lot of these
early flowering individuals are fairly
[SPEAKER_11]: uniform and many of the later flowering
individuals are fairly uniform.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is some uniformity, but it's just
so dramatic what differences in flowering
[SPEAKER_11]: time can do to a family.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we wanna come over here,
Chris, we're gonna look at another family,
[SPEAKER_11]: another S2.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Chris, this is TJ.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is that common parent of all of these
F1s.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a really irregular shape to it,
kind of drooping leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a high cannabinoid hemp type.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also in that S1 made a selection of a
early flowering individual.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of homozygous for that
flowering time gene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you can see, it's far more uniform
besides differences really in maybe plant
[SPEAKER_11]: size, but small differences in plant size.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's far more uniform that than that
other S1 that was segregating for the
[SPEAKER_11]: flowering time locus.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some really interesting
families.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: They got dropped again.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are going to move on to our next
presentation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris, we're gonna move on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're gonna move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Craig is gonna run into the office
here so he can join our Q and A.
[SPEAKER_13]: So our next presentation is from Jamie
Crawford.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who will be talking about our grain and
fiber trials mostly in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me get that going for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Jamie Crawford and I'll be
giving you a brief update on our hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: grain and fiber trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our trial design is a randomized complete
block where each entry is replicated four
[SPEAKER_08]: times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plots are four feet wide and 20 feet long
and seeding rate is calculated based on
[SPEAKER_08]: the germination rate and seed weight of
each entry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the 20 live seeds are planted per
square foot in the grain and dual trials
[SPEAKER_08]: and 40 live seeds are planted per square
foot in the fiber trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Complete hemp grain and fiber reports for
each year can be found on our website,
[SPEAKER_08]: but this graph shows the range of grain
yields in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ithaca and Geneva by year.
[SPEAKER_08]: The yields for 2017 and 2019 were quite
similar, ranging from seven to 800 pounds
[SPEAKER_08]: per acre for the lower yielding entries to
1300 to 1400 pounds per acre in the higher
[SPEAKER_08]: yielding entries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Decrease in yield in 2018 was due to the
timing of harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: One location was harvested too early
before grain was mature in all entries and
[SPEAKER_08]: one location was harvested too late with
much of the grain lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shattering our birds when harvesting for
grain timing is very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fiber yields in 2017 were low due to poor
seed quality and very thin stands with new
[SPEAKER_08]: higher germinating seed lots in 2018 and
2019 entries were yielding between five
[SPEAKER_08]: and six dry tons per acre before reading
and two and a half to three and a half dry
[SPEAKER_08]: tons per acre after reading.
[SPEAKER_08]: We established grain and fiber trials in
two locations this spring, the first in
[SPEAKER_08]: Geneva planted on June 4th.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second planted in Ithaca on June
6th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ithaca had received six tenths of an inch
more rain than in Geneva in the two weeks
[SPEAKER_08]: leading up to planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this made a huge difference in the
success of the trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the field was so dry when it was
prepped for planting, hard baked chunks of
[SPEAKER_08]: soil limited seed soil contact.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had we received the predicted rain,
it could have been okay, but the lack of
[SPEAKER_08]: rain in the weeks after planting led to
poor emergence and then the trial was
[SPEAKER_08]: overrun by rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: The additional soil moisture at the Ithaca
location led to a finer seed bed,
[SPEAKER_08]: excellent emergence and what should have
been an excellent stand if our cone seeder
[SPEAKER_08]: hadn't been slowly breaking as we were
planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: While we were planting the Ithaca trials,
the load bar which supported the packer
[SPEAKER_08]: wheels was slowly twisting, planting some
of the rows more deeply and packing the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil over top of them very firmly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We planted the fiber trial first that day
and all six rows emerged.
[SPEAKER_08]: But by the last plot planted that day,
only two rows emerged as expected.
[SPEAKER_08]: The planter was repaired and then the
grain and dual purpose trials were
[SPEAKER_08]: replanted on June 24th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since these hemp varieties are photo
period sensitive, planting later leads to
[SPEAKER_08]: shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tops of the signs in both pictures are
30 inches from the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Piccolo planted the beginning of June is
close to four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Piccolo planted the end of June is two and
a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canola is over five feet tall in the
original planting and not quite four feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the replant, we expect the grain yields
to be similar between these trials,
[SPEAKER_08]: but shorter entries are more susceptible
to weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: For my remaining time, I'd like to show
you some pictures of our trials here in
[SPEAKER_08]: Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start out with the fiber trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fiber trial was planted on June 6th,
so it's from the original planting and has
[SPEAKER_08]: four entries.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two new entries this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one on the left is called Yuma
crossbow.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some conflicting information on
whether it should be included in the dual
[SPEAKER_08]: purpose or the fiber trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you can see here, we made the wrong
choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually earlier flowering than some
of the entries in our dual purpose trials
[SPEAKER_08]: and we will be harvesting it for grain
later this month.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other new entry this year is Jinma.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a little bit later maturing than
the Italian varieties we have in the trial
[SPEAKER_08]: as sort of our checks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's looking really good so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our grain trial has eight entries,
starting on the left with X-59.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's CRS-1 in the middle and Canda on
the right.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this photo, that's Canda again on the
left, followed by USO 31 in the middle and
[SPEAKER_08]: Canola on the right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, this photo has Piccolo
on the left, Joey in the middle and CFX 2
[SPEAKER_08]: on the right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our dual purpose trials has 15 entries
this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: First there on the left, you can see NWG
Elite, followed by NWG Abound and Felina
[SPEAKER_08]: 32 in the second set.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this slide, you see Fedora 17,
Vega, and then Anca.
[SPEAKER_08]: This slide is Futura 75 on the left,
Felicia in the middle and Bia Jurecki on
[SPEAKER_08]: the right.
[SPEAKER_08]: This slide contains the variety we're
calling H-51 on the left, Hylianna in the
[SPEAKER_08]: center and Rigel on the right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The final three entries in our dual
purpose trial are Altair on the left,
[SPEAKER_08]: Pheromone in the middle, and Voico on the
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so disappointed that we can't be
together in person to show off our trials
[SPEAKER_08]: properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we've held field days in the past,
I've noticed that people just cannot help
[SPEAKER_08]: but touch and smell the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't send the smells of the hemp field
to you, but here is a video of one of our
[SPEAKER_08]: technicians petting the hemp plots for you
to watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy vicariously.
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a great look at the beautiful
trials we have this year in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, our trials here in Geneva
suffered from the drought.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't look nearly as pretty as the
ones in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have now come to our first Q&A.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're right on time, so we have 15 minutes
for live Q&A.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would encourage the panelists to unmute
their video.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go through some of the
excellent questions we got in the chat and
[SPEAKER_13]: start with George for this one.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a very good question about how you
define the start of flowering and what we
[SPEAKER_13]: mean by terminal flowering versus axillary
flowering, if you could elaborate on that
[SPEAKER_13]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that's challenging about
female flowering in hemp is that not all
[SPEAKER_19]: of the cultivars flower in the exact same
way, so their floral morphology is
[SPEAKER_19]: different.
[SPEAKER_19]: We define terminal flowering as a cluster
of female flowers at the shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_19]: We found that that was a pretty consistent
way to mark all of the cultivars at the
[SPEAKER_19]: same physiological point.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will note that some cultivars do form
axillary flowers, just one single small
[SPEAKER_19]: female flower in the axils of the leaves a
lot earlier, but that is very variable and
[SPEAKER_19]: is not a great indicator of when the
plants will start terminally flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it can get tricky.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely you want to get a loop or some
other magnifying glass so you can look at
[SPEAKER_13]: the development of the trichomes as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to see the development from clear
trichomes to milky and then to amber.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those will be your cues as to the time of
maturity and the time of harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jacob, I'll point this one to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a question about whether we are
breeding cultivars that are high in varan
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids or CBC as an example.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'll answer that question.
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year we tested several varieties and
especially a few from China had quite high
[SPEAKER_18]: varan concentrations, but just like as I
was talking about with Bama and Puma,
[SPEAKER_18]: they tended to mostly be THCV,
they tended to be mostly type 1 and type
[SPEAKER_18]: 2.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're actually currently growing a large
population that we intend to screen with
[SPEAKER_18]: the molecular marker to pull out the type
3 plants and we hope that those types of
[SPEAKER_18]: type 3 plants in that population that
produces a lot of varans will produce a
[SPEAKER_18]: lot of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_18]: So in theory, if this works and you can
get high varans, we may be able to develop
[SPEAKER_18]: a dual purpose CBDV grain or fiber
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_18]: As for CBC, we're seeing some very
interesting results, especially in some of
[SPEAKER_18]: these high CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have one that produced up to 2% CBC.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're currently working to understand the
basis of that production, but at the
[SPEAKER_18]: moment, we're not actively working to
create any pure high CBC lines.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to follow on, there are a couple more
questions that I'll aim at you regarding
[SPEAKER_13]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you could briefly describe the
genetic systems, George did touch on this,
[SPEAKER_13]: of how we get a high CBG line and what
would happen if that CBG line were
[SPEAKER_13]: segregating, for example, were
heterozygous for an active THCA synthase
[SPEAKER_13]: or was heterozygous for an active CBDA
synthase?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_18]: So all cannabinoids start off as CBDA.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what it starts at and then if
there's an active CBDA or an active THCA,
[SPEAKER_18]: that enzyme converts the CBGA to THCA or
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the absence of those enzymes,
you get a CBGA dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if you have a plant that's
heterozygous for a CBDA synthase or a THCA
[SPEAKER_18]: synthase, that's something that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not 100% sure what the result will
be.
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on the activity of this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's a lot of that enzyme in this
heterozygous case, it's possible that
[SPEAKER_18]: we'll get the same conversion from CBGA to
CBDA or THCA.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's also possible that in the
heterozygous case, the enzyme wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_18]: expressed at high enough levels to fully
convert the CBGA to CBDA or THCA.
[SPEAKER_18]: And in that case, we would expect to see
an intermediate value.
[SPEAKER_18]: We currently have a few F1s growing in the
field between chemotype 3 and chemotype 4.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'll be testing those once they start
to flower.
[SPEAKER_18]: But at the moment, we don't have any hard
data.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's probably going to be some
variation.
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a significant amount of variation
in CBDA synthase enzymes.
[SPEAKER_18]: We would expect some to be more active
than others.
[SPEAKER_18]: So in short, it probably varies.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're working to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We should, again, qualify that much of the
results that were presented today are
[SPEAKER_13]: mid-season results.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not analyzed any of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: From the 12 CBG lines that we have in
trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to point to Jamie.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an excellent question about
pollination.
[SPEAKER_13]: And how do we maintain these feminized CBD
trials at the same time we're also doing
[SPEAKER_13]: grain and fiber trials?
[SPEAKER_13]: So Jamie, you touched on that in the chat
box, but let's elaborate on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here in Ithaca, our terrain is very
full of hills and gorges and very
[SPEAKER_08]: different landscapes that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so by mileage, we keep all of our
trials at least one mile apart.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then in addition to that, they're
definitely separated by lots of landscape
[SPEAKER_08]: features.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our CBD and essential oil trials are on
an area that's pretty much surrounded by
[SPEAKER_08]: forested areas as an additional barrier to
try and keep the pollen out of those
[SPEAKER_08]: areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's another set of questions in
there about irrigation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So did we irrigate through the drought?
[SPEAKER_13]: And how was fertilization done?
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is one of the major differences
between our current CBD cultivation
[SPEAKER_13]: practices, which are based on plastic
culture and drip irrigation, versus the
[SPEAKER_13]: broadacre grain and fiber cultivation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want to talk about that a little
bit, Jamie?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So none of our fiber and grain trials were
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did our very best guess on when to
plant based on the weather forecast and
[SPEAKER_08]: what we could see.
[SPEAKER_08]: But because they have to be separated by
such a great distance, a lot of the areas
[SPEAKER_08]: where we would plant our grain and fiber
trials are not necessarily in spots where
[SPEAKER_08]: we even could irrigate if we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the fields are fertilized before we
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe this year we used $22.99.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was broadcast on the field at a
rate about 75 pounds of nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at about a month into the
planting, the fiber trials and the grain
[SPEAKER_08]: trials were given an additional 70 pounds
of nitrogen per acre as ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_08]: The CBD trials, Craig is there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could probably talk more about those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were all through the drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been injecting a water-soluble
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did include granular fertilizer as we
laid the beds at about 90 pounds of
[SPEAKER_13]: nitrogen to the acre.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have supplemented that with
soluble 12-5-16 fertilizer through the
[SPEAKER_13]: drip line.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done that twice in our CBD trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point, most of those CBD plants
are in flower or very close to flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will not add any additional
fertilizer at this point, although there's
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of research that needs to be done to
clarify a best practice here, an optimum
[SPEAKER_13]: management practice.
[SPEAKER_13]: But our plants are quite large right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And encouraging additional vegetative
growth may not be beneficial overall at
[SPEAKER_13]: this point.
[SPEAKER_13]: So many other good questions in here,
and we're going to do our best to answer
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can't answer them in this Q&A
session, by all means follow up with us
[SPEAKER_13]: afterwards or follow up with your local
Cornell Cooperative Extension specialist.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a question about why sending the
Chinese fiber plants to Florida?
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there not supplemental lighting in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Jacob, do you want to answer that
question?
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot that we don't know about
these plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've run some GBS on them, and Craig has
some interesting data about them.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they tend to be quite genetically
distinct, and quite genetically distinct,
[SPEAKER_18]: especially from other grain and fiber
types.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we think is going on is that it
requires a very short day length.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know what that critical photo
period is.
[SPEAKER_18]: For a lot of our full season CBD
varieties, once the day length gets below
[SPEAKER_18]: about 14 hours, we start seeing flowering.
[SPEAKER_18]: For these plants, it might be considerably
lower.
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be 13 hours.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: But in Florida, which is a lot closer to
the equator, we're expecting the day
[SPEAKER_18]: length to be shorter.
[SPEAKER_18]: And in Florida, the East Collaborator has
also been testing these lines.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they flowered late in Florida.
[SPEAKER_18]: But they flowered, and they were able to
harvest seed.
[SPEAKER_18]: In our trials, we didn't push it to the
last possible second.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we were not able to harvest seed from
these varieties.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we think it's due to a very short
photo period requirement for these plants
[SPEAKER_18]: to flower.
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the greenhouse, the plants were
mature.
[SPEAKER_18]: They mature around March or so.
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that point, some of the plants were
just starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we don't have a shade curtain.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the day lengths were starting to get
too long at that point.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the plants that were starting to
flower ceased flowering, went back to
[SPEAKER_18]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_18]: So ultimately, if we had a shade curtain
and could block out the sun, we might have
[SPEAKER_18]: been able to get them to flower.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we don't have that facility yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the problem was actually not
supplemental lighting, but our lack of
[SPEAKER_13]: ability to deprive the plants,
to shade the plants, and keep them dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're very much looking forward to
having that light deprivation shading so
[SPEAKER_13]: that we can control flowering all 12
months of the year, even when the days get
[SPEAKER_13]: too long, which is in March and April.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some other questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a good question from Paul about
whether molecular breeding can be used for
[SPEAKER_13]: pest and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a great lead-in to our next talks
in the next session, starting at 10 o
[SPEAKER_13]: 'clock, where Chris and Ali will talk
about some of our work on powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_13]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, we are confident that we will be
able to develop molecular markers for at
[SPEAKER_13]: least for some disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are questions about recommendations
for the best cultivars for dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me also get back to a question
about a dual purpose fiber and CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have posted our grain and fiber
trial results on our website.
[SPEAKER_13]: So please look those up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say there is variability in the
quality of seed lots from year to year
[SPEAKER_13]: still.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is still a major issue in the
industry, is the ability to get reliably
[SPEAKER_13]: high quality seed from year to year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Finding a local seed source helps with
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have had very good relationship with
uniseeds just across the border in Ontario
[SPEAKER_13]: in providing us high quality seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: But please look over those results and
recognize that they are still only on a
[SPEAKER_13]: relatively small number of sites and soil
types in New York state.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just say in general that hemp demands
the highest quality soils you have in your
[SPEAKER_13]: farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: It requires a deep rich loam that is well
drained.
[SPEAKER_13]: So don't believe the hype that hemp can
grow on marginal soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or as one of my good friends and
colleagues said, you can grow it on
[SPEAKER_13]: marginal soil and you'll get marginal
yield.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a good question about producing
CBD and fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the CBD is produced in the female
flowers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to get the optimum fiber, high quality
long fiber, you need to harvest relatively
[SPEAKER_13]: early right at the start of flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there may well be enough CBD produced
in those flowers at that point in the
[SPEAKER_13]: development that you can get a reasonable
yield of CBD as well as your yield of high
[SPEAKER_13]: quality fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: And hemp flax has produced a harvester
that has a flower harvesting combine head
[SPEAKER_13]: that can rise quite high and chop those
flower heads and at the same time be
[SPEAKER_13]: chopping the fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we look forward to the industry
continuing to expand and develop that
[SPEAKER_13]: machinery so that we can potentially do a
dual purpose CBD and fiber harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll just answer one more question in
here that I noticed.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about going to a broad acre
cultivation for CBD?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's definitely a trend that we're
seeing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're seeing in Colorado, center pivot
irrigation and broad acre planting for
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually have two trials planted this
year, direct seeded CBD trials,
[SPEAKER_13]: one at very high density, similar to our
grain and fiber trials and the other a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit lower planted on 30 inch
spacing that we've been down to 12 or 18
[SPEAKER_13]: inches between plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a flower company combine header
on order.
[SPEAKER_13]: It should come in in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we look forward to
researching next year.
[SPEAKER_13]: The end of this year and next year is
focusing more on broad acre plantings and
[SPEAKER_13]: combine harvesting of flower heads for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to pause right here and we
have a five minute break.
[SPEAKER_13]: So continue to ask your questions in the
chat box so the panelists can respond to
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will be back and start our program
again at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, welcome back everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 10 o'clock and we're going to resume
our program.
[SPEAKER_13]: Next on our program, well, we're starting
our second session on hemp crop management
[SPEAKER_13]: with some of our pathologists and
entomologists and weed scientists in this
[SPEAKER_13]: group, starting with a live presentation
from graduate student, Ali Kala in the
[SPEAKER_13]: field with Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Chris, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go ahead and unmute and we will
start the presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Larry said, my name's Ali,
Ali Kala.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a graduate student in Chris Smart's
lab who is out here with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we're staying six feet apart
and also out here is another lab member of
[SPEAKER_04]: ours, Colin Day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry in advance if we disconnect,
we're going to do our best.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to talk a little bit
about some of my research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking mostly at a pathogen called
powdery mildew, which we have out here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the field that we wanted to show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working with Larry's lab to do
some looking for resistance for powdery
[SPEAKER_04]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to talk a little bit about a
different project today about how powdery
[SPEAKER_04]: mildew can affect secondary metabolites in
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all know about some secondary
metabolites like cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: which include CBD and CPG.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's another class of secondary
metabolites that hemp produces a lot of,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And terpenes are volatile compounds that
are also produced by the flowers and are
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for the fragrance and flavor
of the hemp flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have three major questions that
we're trying to address with this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first being how do the terpene
profiles in hemp change throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: season and how does flowering time affect
those terpene profiles?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for that project, we are collecting
terpene samples weekly throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: season from the same plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our second question is how does a
biological fungicide affect the terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that project, we have been
treating some plants with a bacillus-based
[SPEAKER_04]: biological fungicide according to the
label rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've taken samples from plants that
were treated and plants that were
[SPEAKER_04]: untreated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I recently inoculated those plants
with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once an infection is established,
we'll take another collection from those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and we'll be able to see how those
compare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third question is more
relating to the pathogens themselves and
[SPEAKER_04]: how the pathogens can affect terpene
profiles as well as cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that one, we're adding in a second
pathogen, botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have plants inoculated with
powdery mildew, plants inoculated with
[SPEAKER_04]: botrytis, and healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll take terpene samples from all
three of those types of plants and see how
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpene levels differ.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that project as well, at the end
of the season, we will also take flower
[SPEAKER_04]: samples so that we can look at cannabinoid
profiles as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for collecting terpenes, it's a little
bit more challenging and we have to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more creative since those
compounds are volatiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have kind of an interesting setup
for our collections that we kind of wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about and show you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have our setup here and we use these
turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just these plastic bags that
people use to cook turkey in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually have to bake these so that
we don't have to have any interference
[SPEAKER_04]: with chemicals from the bags and what
we're collecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we take these bags and we just secure
them around a part of the plant that we
[SPEAKER_04]: want to collect, usually a part that has
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We secure it at the base with zip ties to
make it nice and secure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, we cut two holes in
the bag, one so we have airflow in and one
[SPEAKER_04]: so we have airflow out.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the hole that is the airflow in,
we secure a filter so that the air coming
[SPEAKER_04]: in isn't going to contaminate our sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the airflow out, we have,
it's connected to some tubing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is then connected to a collection
tube, which has a filter inside that the
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds can stick to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the collection tube is connected to a
pump, which provides the airflow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of this equipment is provided to
us by Dennis Willett's lab, who we're
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborating with on this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we have our collection on this
tube, it goes directly onto a machine
[SPEAKER_04]: called a gas spectrometer and mass
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that machine can allow us to see what
compounds are there and at what levels
[SPEAKER_04]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can determine a secondary metabolite
profile for all of our samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the GC-MS is also provided by the
Dennis Willett lab, who is working with us
[SPEAKER_04]: on this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're kindly letting us use all of
this equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is what I've got for my secondary
metabolite project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have some more powdery on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the reason we're out in
this trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some nice examples of powdery out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to answering any
questions later during the Q&A session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Larry.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: That worked great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And folks can definitely see that we have
our share of powdery mildew in our trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to shift now to start the
presentation from Jen Starr in Gary
[SPEAKER_13]: Bergstrom's lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she will give you some excellent
descriptions of other disease we have had
[SPEAKER_13]: in hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, and welcome to the 2020 Virtual
Cornell Hemp Research Team Field Day.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Jennifer Starr, and I am the
research support specialist for Dr. Gary
[SPEAKER_10]: Bergstrom's field crops pathology
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also work alongside Kevin Myers,
who helps with scouting for hemp disease
[SPEAKER_10]: and does our molecular testing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, I'll be giving a brief overview of
foliar diseases and possible management
[SPEAKER_10]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to focus this talk on just a few
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: To highlight, I will start with septoria
leafspot and bipolaris leafspot,
[SPEAKER_10]: also known as hemp leafspot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I will move to lesser impact emerging
leaf diseases, such as Down syndrome.
[SPEAKER_10]: These spots expand over time, turn brown,
and the yellow margins broaden to look
[SPEAKER_10]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was observed in eastern New York in
2019, and in eastern and western New York
[SPEAKER_10]: in 2020.
[SPEAKER_10]: In this slide, I have a video of what
septoria leafspot looks like in the field.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you can see, it is on the lower
leaves, with the bigger yellow margins.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is septoria leafspot.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next highlight is bipolaris leafspot,
also known as hemp leafspot.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is caused by a fungus that's being
classified as bipolaris gigantea,
[SPEAKER_10]: related to dreshlara gigantea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Symptoms start as round specks and spots
that coalesce over time, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_10]: they have a dark margin here with lighter
tan interiors, or sometimes don't have any
[SPEAKER_10]: margin at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have noticed this leafspot disease
since Cornell's hemp team started the
[SPEAKER_10]: program a few years back, and we usually
notice this at the end of the growing
[SPEAKER_10]: season, and we have noticed this
throughout New York State.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a super high impact disease,
as other states have seen it defoliate
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have not seen that yet in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we have downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lesser impact, emerging disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is caused by Pseudoprenospora
cannabina, which has just been recently
[SPEAKER_10]: ID'd by sequencing last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: The spots start out as these light green,
yellow spots with necrotic margins,
[SPEAKER_10]: and the lower surface of the leaf,
you can actually see the fungus growing in
[SPEAKER_10]: humid conditions, or if you catch it in
the morning time when the dew is still
[SPEAKER_10]: there, it starts to grow on the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Later on, the lesions become a little more
angular and are defined by the leaf veins
[SPEAKER_10]: of the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was just recently observed in Ithaca
last week, so in 2020.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the next slide, I have a video of what
it looks like on the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a good example of how the veins of
the leaf are demarcating the spot and
[SPEAKER_10]: confining it, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is downy mildew on hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our last feature is hemp rust.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hemp rust has been morphologically
identified as urido cragariana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this is something we're going to
want to be looking at on the lower surface
[SPEAKER_10]: of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have yellow to orange pustules,
or spots on the lower surface.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the upper surface, we have these
necrotic areas with very faint chlorosis
[SPEAKER_10]: around them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then sometimes, rust disease systems have
alternate hosts to complete their life
[SPEAKER_10]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have not found an alternate host with
this hemp rust.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes, rust disease systems don't have
alternate hosts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We found this last year at the end of the
growing season in October of 2019.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be looking again this year for
this so we can try to study it further.
[SPEAKER_10]: The following slide is a close up of what
the pustule looks like on the under
[SPEAKER_10]: surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do see other hemp leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to include a quick summary of
those here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see crystal areola zonate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see circospiral leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see some psyllium leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also see a number of other diseases
that are not leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see fusarium bud blight, which could
have implications for quality of flowers
[SPEAKER_10]: and grain.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see white mold.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, in addition to leaf spot
diseases, we do see and work on other
[SPEAKER_10]: diseases that are affecting hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Possible product treatments, we are
directing growers to go to the New York
[SPEAKER_10]: DEC webpage at this address and go to
pesticide product information,
[SPEAKER_10]: hit search.
[SPEAKER_10]: This will bring you to advanced search.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to click that, press search.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which will then bring you to pesticide
use.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to choose hemp industrial,
hit search.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will bring up about 98 products,
most of which are biologic in nature,
[SPEAKER_10]: some bacillus type products.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to check the labels on those to
make sure hemp is included.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of this information again is present
on the Cornell hemp webpage under the FAQ
[SPEAKER_10]: heading.
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to the DEC webpage,
we want to use best agronomic practices.
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be second nature to seasoned
growers and producers.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we want to start with prevention,
with having reliable seed source and good
[SPEAKER_10]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a myth that hemp can be produced on
marginal soils.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want fertile soil, well-drained soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want our plant spacing to be such where
we're reducing the humidity between the
[SPEAKER_10]: plants, because fungus really loves to be
in humid places.
[SPEAKER_10]: It encourages its growth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sanitation, very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to remove debris off-site.
[SPEAKER_10]: You may burn it, you may compost it,
but we want it away from the hemp field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weed control, also very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have noticed circospora growing on
weeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have noticed downy mildew growing on
weeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are those weeds vectors for fungal growth
too?
[SPEAKER_10]: To the hemp or is it the other way around?
[SPEAKER_10]: We are still investigating that,
but it's important to keep those weeds in
[SPEAKER_10]: control and out of the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crop rotation, also something to note.
[SPEAKER_10]: Edible beans, soybeans, sunflowers,
and their white mold, probably not a great
[SPEAKER_10]: idea to follow hemp after those crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in question recently, corn and cereal
crops producing mycotoxins will be wise to
[SPEAKER_10]: put hemp after those crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then resistant cultivars, something that
our program here at Cornell are working
[SPEAKER_10]: towards now.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have questions about your hemp crop
and have problems and want some
[SPEAKER_10]: diagnostics, it may be wise for you to
contact your Cornell Cooperative Extension
[SPEAKER_10]: Educator.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know who yours is,
you may go to the Cornell hemp page and
[SPEAKER_10]: find who your representative is.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you would like to submit samples to my
lab, you may submit them through your
[SPEAKER_10]: Cornell Cooperative Extension Educator
through them to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may not give you the best turnaround
time, but it will be of no charge to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you're looking for some quick
results, you can use our plant disease
[SPEAKER_10]: diagnostic clinic at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a fee for service.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's relatively low cost.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's $30 to $35 if you're in
state, $50 if you're out of state,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I've left the contact information for
you here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, all of this information is on the
Cornell team web page.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to leave you with our lab's
contact information.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Dr. Gary Bergstrom's email
address.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my email address and our
laboratory phone number if you have
[SPEAKER_10]: further questions after this talk today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your time, and I hope you enjoy
the rest of Cornell's virtual hemp talks
[SPEAKER_10]: today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, Jen.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're a little bit ahead of schedule now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a couple of minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do see a couple of questions in the chat
box if Jen or Gary are available and want
[SPEAKER_13]: to follow up on those questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: One is, are any of these products OMRI
listed?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just jump in.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Gary.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are quite a few things listed with
fungicidal or insecticidal activity on the
[SPEAKER_16]: OMRI list, and a lot of those are on the
DEC list.
[SPEAKER_16]: The term suggested is problematic because
there's very little test data supporting
[SPEAKER_16]: efficacy at this point, and I know that
Chris and her lab is looking at that in
[SPEAKER_16]: the context of mildew and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've done some fairly rudimentary testing
for some of the late season things,
[SPEAKER_16]: but really there's not a database there to
point to.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have counseled growers to look at a few
materials that have efficacy in other crop
[SPEAKER_16]: areas.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some insights that they might work
and to try to do some treated strips and
[SPEAKER_16]: leave some non-treated to try to learn
something here.
[SPEAKER_16]: But recommendations are a bit elusive,
at least for us in New York at this point.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's another question specifically
about Bacillus fungicides cease or
[SPEAKER_13]: serenade.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if Chris has included those
in her trial.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Chris is on, but again, the trial is
underway.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have results at this point.
[SPEAKER_13]: As Gary mentioned, it's definitely an
active area of research.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jan and Gary, one more question before we
move on to Marion's presentation from
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you see any cultivar differences in
susceptibility to leaf spots?
[SPEAKER_16]: Great question, Nicole, and I know you're
interested in this as well, and the answer
[SPEAKER_16]: is hopefully yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether they're repeatable differences,
that's what we want to know.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have particular opportunity in the
cultivar trials out this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: To try to discriminate cultivars in the
sense of downy mildew, for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I think with the Bipolaris hemp leaf
spot as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, that's a goal and we're not
there yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps in Kentucky, you got a better read
on some of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, Gary and Jan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great presentation.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to start Marion Zufles.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Marion Zufles' presentation from
New York State IPM.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will just give you a heads up.
[SPEAKER_13]: The audio levels on this video are pretty
low, so you may need to turn up your
[SPEAKER_13]: volume a bit once it gets started here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Marion Zufles and I work for
the New York State Integrated Pest
[SPEAKER_06]: Management Program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I'm going to talk to you about
insect pests or potential insect pests of
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp and their management.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was my first summer working in hemp
and I've really enjoyed the experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal this summer was to just go out
there and learn as much as I can about
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp, try to identify any insects and
diseases that are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I'm going to specifically just talk
about the insect pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already heard about some of the
diseases out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to focus in on what insects
I found.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get started, I first just wanted
to stress the importance of scouting and
[SPEAKER_06]: identification because not everything
that's out there is a pest.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, very few insects today have
caused enough damage to impact hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: This crop is still relatively new,
so we don't have a lot of thresholds for
[SPEAKER_06]: any insect pests that we do find.
[SPEAKER_06]: For this reason, it's very important for
you to go out, scout your hemp fields
[SPEAKER_06]: regularly, and that way you can notice any
potential problems and keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did this summer was I scouted nine
different hemp fields weekly, as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: one high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also set up European corn borer tracks,
which you can see here in the picture,
[SPEAKER_06]: next to hemp fields so I can monitor the
flight of European corn borer,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is one of the known potential pests
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, not everything is a pest,
so we have to be able to identify what's a
[SPEAKER_06]: pest, what's a beneficial, and what's an
incidental, an insect that just happens to
[SPEAKER_06]: be out in the field but isn't causing any
damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to go over some of the
insects that I did find this season.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one that I encountered was early
in the season while the plants were still
[SPEAKER_06]: in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The grower came to me and he informed me
that hundreds of seedlings were dying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that from the top upper
right-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: The seedlings were turning yellow and were
dying, and he wasn't quite sure what was
[SPEAKER_06]: causing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We noticed that he had a lot of fungus
gnats, and he also had fusarium.
[SPEAKER_06]: We determined that it was fusarium.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took some seedlings and sent them to
Chris Smart, and she identified fusarium
[SPEAKER_06]: in the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fungus gnats, they are tiny little
flies that lay their eggs in wet soil near
[SPEAKER_06]: the base of the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The larvae will hatch out of the eggs,
and then they start feeding on decaying
[SPEAKER_06]: matter, but they will also feed on roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both the adult fungus gnats as well as the
larvae can transmit diseases such as
[SPEAKER_06]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the grower did is he changed out his
potting media, and then he also decreased
[SPEAKER_06]: his watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was over-watering his plants,
and you're supposed to really let them dry
[SPEAKER_06]: out between waterings, let the top layer
dry out between waterings.
[SPEAKER_06]: That really helped his fungus gnats
problem, and he also introduced nematodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing you can do to monitor for fungus
gnats is you can place yellow sticky cards
[SPEAKER_06]: in your greenhouse so the you can detect
them early.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do have fungus gnats, you should
allow the top layer of soil to dry out
[SPEAKER_06]: completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will kill both the fungus,
which the gnats feed on, as well as the
[SPEAKER_06]: fungus gnats larvae.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really let that soil dry out between
waterings.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the two-spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are small little mites found on the
underside of leaves, and they cause this
[SPEAKER_06]: stippling appearance that you can see in
both of the pictures, kind of on the upper
[SPEAKER_06]: surface of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You usually notice the stippling first,
and then if you turn the leaf over,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll find the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: These I found in the high tunnel as well
as in the field, and both in the high
[SPEAKER_06]: tunnel as well as in the field,
the numbers stayed fairly low.
[SPEAKER_06]: The high tunnel has since been harvested,
and no control measures were needed,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the populations in the field have
never increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: I monitor it weekly, and the numbers have
stayed very, very low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two-spotted spider mites do prefer very
hot, dry weather, so one of the ways to
[SPEAKER_06]: manage for them is to make sure that your
plants aren't water-stressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also remove any potential weed
hosts that are surrounding your field,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then if you do have a spider mite
problem or you know that you will,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can release predatory mites to control
the spider mite population.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you do do this, you have to do it
in advance of the spider mites becoming
[SPEAKER_06]: out of control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as soon as you have that first sign of
two-spotted spider mites, you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: release your beneficial predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the red-headed flea beetle,
which was probably the most numerous
[SPEAKER_06]: insect that I observed this summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The adults are fairly large, three to six
millimeters, and have a reddish-brown head
[SPEAKER_06]: and a shiny black body.
[SPEAKER_06]: They feed on the leaves between the veins
and cause these holes all over the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though they were very numerous and I
saw quite a bit of damage, all the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: grew out of it, and the young seedlings
are the ones that are most at risk from
[SPEAKER_06]: flea beetle damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the control measures you can do
is you can protect your young seedlings
[SPEAKER_06]: with row cover until they're large enough
to withstand the feeding pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also plow to decrease the
overwintering population, and then you can
[SPEAKER_06]: use beneficial nematodes, which will
control the larvae in the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also found some aphids.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are small sap-sucking insects,
kind of pear-shaped.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're found on the underside of the
leaves, but they can also be found near
[SPEAKER_06]: the stem or in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are several different species of
aphids that are known to occur on hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the nine fields that I was scouting,
only one of them did I find aphids,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they remained on the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of beneficials,
including ladybugs and minute pirate bugs
[SPEAKER_06]: and lacewings that really kept the
population under control.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are still out there, and I'm still
monitoring them weekly to make sure the
[SPEAKER_06]: population doesn't get any bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did take a sample and I sent it to the
Cornell Insect Diagnostic Lab for
[SPEAKER_06]: identification because I don't know what
species it is, but I only found the one in
[SPEAKER_06]: one field.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a few different insects that
will bore into the stem of hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: including the common stalk borer,
which is pictured here, as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: European corn borer and the hemp borer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one that I found this season was
the common stalk borer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've not found the other ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did set up traps for European corn
borer, but the numbers were very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very low and I never found any in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a picture of a larvae inside a
hemp stalk.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are brown with these long white lines
that run the length of the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: The female will lay her eggs in grasses
and weeds kind of around the edge of a
[SPEAKER_06]: field, and when the larvae hatch,
they will move into the field looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: a suitable plant to bore into.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the management options is to
control your weeds and grasses in the
[SPEAKER_06]: surrounding fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually, if you do have stalk borer,
it's going to be on the edge of fields
[SPEAKER_06]: where you're going to find the damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another option is to plant your plants
early so that they're large enough that
[SPEAKER_06]: when the larvae move in, they can
withstand some of that boring damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chemical control options are limited
because once they're inside the stem,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're protected from any kind of
chemical control.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last insect that I'm going to
talk about, the yellow woolly bear
[SPEAKER_06]: caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a caterpillar that feeds on many
different plants, including hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's covered in dense yellow hairs over
its entire body.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this one I found in the high tunnel
that I was scouting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually it doesn't cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The female lays about 50 eggs on a host
plant and the caterpillars, they feed
[SPEAKER_06]: together for a little while, but then they
disperse throughout the field and just
[SPEAKER_06]: cause a little bit of damage to individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: But because this was in a high tunnel,
they were all concentrated in one area and
[SPEAKER_06]: they couldn't disperse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It caused much more significant damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I was in there scouting,
I noticed a lot of the plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: the lower third of the plant was
completely defoliated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I notified the grower about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we ended up doing, he just went
in and handpicked them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably about 100 or so in the
high tunnel, but he couldn't control them
[SPEAKER_06]: since it wasn't a defined area.
[SPEAKER_06]: He could just go in and handpick them all
to remove them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it didn't really cause any serious
damage because we were able to get rid of
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here just real briefly is a list of
some of the other insects that I found on
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp, which includes the leaf miner,
which I'm attempting to rear out to
[SPEAKER_06]: determine what species it is, four-lined
plant bug, various caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_06]: different grasshoppers, brown marmorated
stink bug, leafhoppers, treehoppers,
[SPEAKER_06]: the oblique banded leaf roller I was able
to rear that out, and the tarnished plant
[SPEAKER_06]: bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see, there's a lot of
different insects that are found on hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them are pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to know what's a pest,
what's an incidental.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as I mentioned before,
what are your beneficial so that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: just control the ones that you need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's any questions, I will take
those now.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Marion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marion is on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I see a couple of questions in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one minute here.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to pick one out, there's a
question about how prevalent corn borers
[SPEAKER_13]: have been in corn fields in New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: And will this corn borer population
potentially impact hemp?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, you can hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So European corn borer in general has been
very low in the state for at least 10,
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: After the introduction of BT field corn,
we do think it might start increasing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more non-GMO field corn being
grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the European corn borer population
might increase.
[SPEAKER_06]: What impact European corn borer is going
to have on hemp?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have personally not seen any corn borer
on hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think hemp, it doesn't tend to lodge or
break as easily as corn does.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the corn borer gets inside the
hemp plant, it might not have as much of
[SPEAKER_06]: an impact on the hemp itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But having not seen it, I couldn't say for
sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe one other question here.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a question about beneficial
control of two spotted spider mites,
[SPEAKER_13]: predatory mites versus ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any data on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any data.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with two spotted spider mites
in other crops, and the predatory mites do
[SPEAKER_06]: a great job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never intentionally released ladybugs
specifically for spider mite control,
[SPEAKER_06]: more so for aphid control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how well the ladybugs
would do on spider mites specifically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that predatory mites do well,
but I don't have any data on the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Marianne.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to move on to Lynn
Sosnowski's talk here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me get that cued up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, welcome to my talk about weeds and
weed management in hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Lynn Sosnowski, and I'm an
assistant professor of weed biology,
[SPEAKER_03]: ecology, and management and specialty
crops here at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds in any cropping system compete with
the crop for water, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: and light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can directly impact yield,
quantity, and quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds that become established in crops can
alter the microclimates around the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: which can then impact disease development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And weeds can actually serve as alternate
hosts for both pests and pathogens in
[SPEAKER_03]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegetation that isn't controlled can
reduce the final harvestability of the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the absence of any kind of vegetation
control chemicals in the hemp crop itself
[SPEAKER_03]: may necessitate the use of multiple and
integrated practices to suppress weeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that become established.
[SPEAKER_03]: With respect to integrated weed management
in hemp, the first step should always be
[SPEAKER_03]: proper site selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means avoiding fields with
perennials or extremely high weed
[SPEAKER_03]: densities.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to start clean,
make sure to try and stay clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always manage and harvest your cleanest
fields first.
[SPEAKER_03]: With respect to planting date,
you might be able to plant and get ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: of weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if the field that you're
planting into has a lot of summer emerging
[SPEAKER_03]: weed species, choose an earlier planting
date that allows your crop to get up and
[SPEAKER_03]: gives it some kind of competitive
advantage against the vegetation it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be competing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using a stale seedbed technique where you
stimulate the germination of weeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: then eliminate emerged seedlings both
physically and chemically can be a really
[SPEAKER_03]: useful tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But understand that not all weeds are
going to respond equally well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Species with non-dormant seeds might be
better controlled under this strategy as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to species with dormant seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you have the best planting
conditions that you can achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, making sure you have a nice
even seedbed so that you have good soil to
[SPEAKER_03]: seed contact for even germination,
which will improve the crop's competitive
[SPEAKER_03]: ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you plant with appropriate
densities to minimize that open space that
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds can then colonize.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using transplants, this can be a
really useful strategy to give your crop a
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive size advantage over the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choosing varieties can have an influence
on how competitive the crop is as well
[SPEAKER_03]: based on the heights and the branching
traits that that variety possesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to be cultivating,
make sure you keep your rows as straight
[SPEAKER_03]: as possible to maximize cultivation
performance and get the weeds while they
[SPEAKER_03]: are small, either at the white thread or
the early seedling stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using plastic mulch,
remember that this is still going to
[SPEAKER_03]: require weeding between beds and removing
weeds that emerge through the planting
[SPEAKER_03]: holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though herbicides aren't available
for use in hemp directly, they're likely
[SPEAKER_03]: to be used in crops that are planted
before hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to pay attention to this
because these products have rotation
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions on the label and hemp may not
be explicitly listed, but the term other
[SPEAKER_03]: crop often is and hemp is going to fall
into that other crop category.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in understanding
the type of plant back restrictions that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be encountered in industrial hemp
production, I suggest doing a Google
[SPEAKER_03]: search for the terms Wisconsin hemp and
rotation restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're really likely to find this nice
handout that was produced by UW Madison,
[SPEAKER_03]: which explicitly looks at the restrictions
that are associated with the herbicides
[SPEAKER_03]: that are used in pre seeding crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of the rotation
restrictions that my colleagues at UW
[SPEAKER_03]: Madison found across multiple herbicide
labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see they're extremely varied
in the amount of time that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: wait before you can plant industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, for the Fusilade and Select
Max labels, there was a one month rotation
[SPEAKER_03]: restriction.
[SPEAKER_03]: For something like Pursuit in Mizethapur,
there was a 40 month rotation restriction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now understand the list is not inclusive
and labels can and do change and it is
[SPEAKER_03]: your responsibility to always consult the
labels before making any herbicide
[SPEAKER_03]: application and before planting crops
following herbicide applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because we don't have herbicides
currently labeled for use in hemp doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: mean that we aren't looking to see how
herbicides affect hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of herbicide trials that are
currently underway in the United States
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're being undertaken for multiple
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first of which is to identify active
ingredients that will be safe to use in
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and to address pest management needs
in the US hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second reason is to identify
herbicides that will be able to control
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp escapes that occur in following
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third reason is to characterize
herbicide symptomology in the case of
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicide carryover or drift injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: While there's considerable interest in
conducting hemp herbicide trials,
[SPEAKER_03]: very few have actually made it to formal
publication stage yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one exception being some work that's
been recently undertaken by Michael
[SPEAKER_03]: Flesner's group at Virginia Tech
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a really good paper where they
evaluated herbicide tolerance of
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial hemp in both greenhouse and
field conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the objective of the research that was
conducted in Michael Flesner's group was
[SPEAKER_03]: to test hemp tolerance to both
pre-emergence and post-emergence
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we say pre-emergence herbicides,
we're talking soil applied herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we're talking post-emergence,
we're talking foliar applied herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did conduct this across years and
they did do the studies in both greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: and in field trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they saw was variability across
time and between growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although with respect to the results,
they did find that S-metolachlor was the
[SPEAKER_03]: least injurious of the soil applied
herbicides in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although their greenhouse trials did
suggest that other active ingredients may
[SPEAKER_03]: have potential for future research.
[SPEAKER_03]: With respect to the foliar applied
herbicides, quazalafop and sethoxidin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are both grass herbicides,
were found to be the least injurious of
[SPEAKER_03]: the post-products along with clopyrrolid
and bromoxanil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like you to know that we're also
conducting herbicide trials here at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the results from a preliminary
screening project that we've started to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the safety of post-emergence or
foliar applied herbicides on industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that our results largely
agree with those that were achieved by
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Flesner's group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primarily, if we're looking at percent
injury, the post-emergence herbicides
[SPEAKER_03]: currently in our trial providing the least
amount of injury to hemp are cletidin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a WSSA1 herbicide, clopyramide
and bromoxanil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we plan to continue these herbicide
screens both in the greenhouse and under
[SPEAKER_03]: field conditions this fall and in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous slide showed you our
post-emergence herbicides that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a suite of pre-emergence
herbicides that we'll be evaluating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we'll be doing it in both the
greenhouse and field conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope to have some trials describing the
impacts of herbicide carryover and drift
[SPEAKER_03]: on crop growth and yield development.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also hoping to look at the biology
of hemp and evaluate its competitiveness
[SPEAKER_03]: with both current weed issues such as
velvet leaf, foxtail, bindweed and
[SPEAKER_03]: nightshade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And up and coming problems in New York
such as Palmer amaranth and water hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank you very much for
attending today's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to get in touch with me to
discuss weeds and weed management in hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: or in any specialty crops, feel free to
contact me via email at lms438 at Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: .edu on my office phone at 315-787-2231.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on social media, you can find me
on both Twitter and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, thank you so much for coming and
attending my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be present during the break if you
have any questions and have a good rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: your day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks very much, Lynn.
[SPEAKER_13]: We now have time for our Q&A session for
about 15 minutes and then we'll take
[SPEAKER_13]: another five minute break.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've seen if our panelists here could
unmute.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll try to pick out some of the
questions from the chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: There were some questions about seeing
leaf hoppers on hemp and gypsy moth on
[SPEAKER_13]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marion, do you want to comment on the
potential impact of I think Joe meant
[SPEAKER_13]: potato leaf hoppers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did find some potato leaf hoppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember exactly when.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably at least six, seven weeks ago
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of adults, they came in,
I was concerned and within two weeks they
[SPEAKER_06]: were all gone and they did not reproduce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I did hear from others that they have
caused problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the fields I were in, they never
reproduced and it's mainly the nymphs that
[SPEAKER_06]: caused the hopper burn and a lot of the
feeding damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did not experience that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if other people have had
issues with leaf hopper, but not that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the gypsy moth, those were in the
high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found I think about two or three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's actually a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happened to be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how extensively they were
feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably nibbled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that gypsy moth is going to
be a pest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one of those things that I
found.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put it in the other insects I found
category.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing, if I have a minute,
just to mention one thing real quickly,
[SPEAKER_06]: I said that I found some aphids on hemp
and I sent them to the diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I received verification that they are
cannabis aphids, which is the first
[SPEAKER_06]: verification in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have it here just so everybody's
aware of.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a lot of aphids last year at the
end of the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you find out what they were?
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we did have them confirmed as
cannabis aphids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you did.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elson had told me that was for as far as
he knew his first verification,
[SPEAKER_06]: but okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just point it to Jamie,
because again, in the Vines lab,
[SPEAKER_13]: they have a lot of experience working with
potato leafhopper and hopper burn on
[SPEAKER_13]: alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know Jamie, if she's still on,
has seen some hopper burn on hemp in
[SPEAKER_13]: Ithaca, but she may not be on right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Larry, I can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in the Ithaca fiber and grain plots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think last week, it might've been the
week before, and there's considerable
[SPEAKER_09]: damage from potato leafhopper on grain,
dual and fiber.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is quite striking and remarkable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not an entomologist or insect person,
so I don't know what stage these insects
[SPEAKER_09]: are, but it is occurring and striking,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if they have good years
and bad years, but this was definitely a
[SPEAKER_09]: good year for potato leafhopper on hemp in
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back to some of the earlier
questions to Ali and Chris, folks were
[SPEAKER_13]: asking about whether we're asking both the
volatile terpenes and the non-volatile
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So unfortunately, we haven't had the
bandwidth to do as much detailed work on
[SPEAKER_13]: the terpenes as we would like,
but Ali and Chris, where do we stand on
[SPEAKER_13]: characterization of all the different
types of terpenes?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're right now just looking at
volatile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we have standards for,
and anything that's not volatile are
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the end of the season, we'll take
flowers and get total cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: analysis, and we'll be working with Dennis
to try to get a broader panel of terpenes
[SPEAKER_14]: as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a question from Jeff Costier to
Lynn.
[SPEAKER_13]: Any work on ethyl fluorolyne for pre-plant
application in hemp?
[SPEAKER_13]: Has minor use approval in Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I just sent a written response
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, there is some work that is being
done in the US in various labs looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: ethyl fluorolyne as well as the other
dinitroaniline herbicides, so
[SPEAKER_03]: pentamethylene and trifluorolyne.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the exact results with
ethyl fluorolyne that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been varied response and safety
with respect to pentamethylene,
[SPEAKER_03]: but pentamethylene, ethyl fluorolyne,
and trifluorolyne are all going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: products that will be tested in our
pre-emergence herbicide trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let me just throw out a question
probably to everyone, and that is,
[SPEAKER_13]: what is the potential outcome of using
some of these products on the test results
[SPEAKER_13]: for CBD extracts?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is some evidence that hemp can
concentrate some of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we do know through our interactions
with the folks at Pixis International that
[SPEAKER_13]: some of their hemp crops have failed in
that final testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So growers definitely need to be in
contact with their buyer and understand
[SPEAKER_13]: the standards for testing that's going to
be done in the final CBD product.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone want to comment on that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right,
Larry.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've actually interacted with now two
different growers here in the state of New
[SPEAKER_14]: York that have gone through quality
control testing and had either a microbial
[SPEAKER_14]: issue, so things are tested for heavy
metals, for pesticides, and for
[SPEAKER_14]: microbials.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it is important to know the final
market, know what's going to be tested,
[SPEAKER_14]: and then I guess I would throw it to Gary
in terms of grain issues, which are really
[SPEAKER_14]: important as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know all the answers to that,
Chris, to that question, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_16]: super important, as you stated there.
[SPEAKER_16]: We were both on a conference at the plant
pathology meetings where speakers from
[SPEAKER_16]: Canada were telling us absolutely nothing
was allowed in end products, no residues
[SPEAKER_16]: of a biological control, no residues of
any kind of chemical.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if the US industry will be
handled that same way, but it's a real
[SPEAKER_16]: concern.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're focused on trying to reduce any
potential for mycotoxins, which there's
[SPEAKER_16]: significant potential there, and that
takes away a pretty big set of tools if we
[SPEAKER_16]: can't control things during the flowering
process.
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe somebody else on the call has
some insights.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a real question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lynn, do you have any insights on
herbicide carryover or herbicide uptake
[SPEAKER_13]: from hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's actually a really good
question, and that is not a topic I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that any weed scientist to date has
actually addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, a lot of the weed science work
hasn't been addressed at all to date,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was actually a paper put out
last year in 2019 kind of expressly saying
[SPEAKER_03]: how far behind we are with respect to all
of these questions in the discipline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's more that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, and I'll just very briefly try to
answer Paul's question about what specific
[SPEAKER_13]: soil testing would you recommend
pre-planting?
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I know we have discussed this with
our colleagues at PIXIS.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hemp is particularly good at taking up
cadmium.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lead, you don't want to plant on a field
that has lead, but we really have a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: more work to do to characterize what heavy
metals you would want to test for and
[SPEAKER_13]: specifically avoid those fields in
planting CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: There may be other pesticide residues also
that you would want to test for,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we really don't have a good handle on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an interesting question here or
comment from Raul at Rutgers that they've
[SPEAKER_13]: had a substantial population of stink bugs
in their CBD hemp trial.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Marion, do you want to comment on
stink bugs?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've seen brown marmorated stink bugs,
and I found some stink bug egg masses.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have some pictures of brown
marmorated stink bugs mating in hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: But have not seen a lot of feeding damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned the majority of the feeding
damage I've seen, but it's also hard to
[SPEAKER_06]: distinguish sometimes feeding damage if
I'm not actively seeing the insect feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of other sucking insects
that could have caused the damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have not personally observed a lot of
stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one I've seen is brown marmorated
and a few stink bug egg masses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was also asked a question about spotted
lanternfly, whether hemp might be a host
[SPEAKER_13]: for spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, as far as I know, in Pennsylvania,
they have not seen, and I heard this from
[SPEAKER_13]: Alyssa Collins at Penn State, they have
not seen any damage to hemp from a spotted
[SPEAKER_13]: lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any insights on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I actually have no idea if they
would get onto hemp or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to have a pretty broad host
range, so potentially, but yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's a question from Josh with Palmer
Amaranth in New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: What challenges might we see in regard to
hemp production and harvest?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are hemp harvesters capable of doing a
good job?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, have not dealt with hemp and
hemp harvest and Palmer Amaranth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have worked with Palmer Amaranth,
which is the weed behind me in almonds,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that goes back to the
harvestability issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Palmer Amaranth gets very large,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets lignified, and it can stop up
cotton harvesters and corn harvesters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I expect that a significant population
will impede the harvestability of hemp as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll just comment that, again,
for high-quality fiber production,
[SPEAKER_13]: fiber hemp production, there is a very,
very low tolerance for weeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it has been a challenge for us in the
absence of any labeled herbicides to
[SPEAKER_13]: maintain and to establish and maintain a
weed spotless field that would meet those
[SPEAKER_13]: quality thresholds for high-quality fiber
harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: For those folks who have been looking at
the chat, any final questions you want to
[SPEAKER_13]: address here in our last minute before the
break?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw, there was a question
about crop density and weed control,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that falls into that last bullet point
from my slide of future research that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to look at the competitiveness of
hemp with various weed species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And crop density impacts are going to be
rolled into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is work that is being done by
other universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing has been published yet,
but I'll be doing some of that work here,
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully, in the coming 2021.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, in CBD hemp, at least,
we've relied on plastic mulch heavily for
[SPEAKER_13]: weed management.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as the industry shifts to more
broad-acre direct seeded plantings,
[SPEAKER_13]: those studies are going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's great to have Lynn on our team.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a question about Xerotol and
powdery mildew, and I have tested that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Xerotol is going to sanitize whatever
it touches, but it will become ineffective
[SPEAKER_14]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so in what we have done to date,
and we are expanding this, but other
[SPEAKER_14]: products, including bacillus-based
products and oil-based products,
[SPEAKER_14]: when applied prior to powdery mildew
getting there, are much more effective
[SPEAKER_14]: than the Xerotol in our studies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one final comment here.
[SPEAKER_13]: There have been a couple of questions
about recommending labs for testings.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not going to recommend a particular
lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have a validation protocol for
validating the results from different
[SPEAKER_13]: commercial labs.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do have a listing of potential labs
that you can use, in particular,
[SPEAKER_13]: ones that can test for heavy metals and
toxins are kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're relatively few.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you go to our website, we try to
maintain a complete list of lab resources
[SPEAKER_13]: that you could potentially use.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I won't call them recommendations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are going to take a break here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 10 56.
[SPEAKER_13]: So another five-minute break, and we will
be back at 11 o'clock with our
[SPEAKER_13]: presentation from Alan Taylor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: To our panelists.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 1101.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to move on to our third
session here, talking about supply chains
[SPEAKER_13]: and regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to start with a talk from
Alan Taylor on seed treatments and
[SPEAKER_13]: soil-borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alan Taylor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm professor of seed science and
technology at Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_01]: My laboratory has been involved in hemp
seed science and technology research since
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cornell hemp team formed in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to speak about today is on
our work on the research and development
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary Berkstrom is my cooperator in plant
pathology as his laboratory, is supportive
[SPEAKER_01]: in helping characterize the pathogens
associated with disease seedlings from our
[SPEAKER_01]: research plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have field trials at North Dakota
State with Burton Johnson and Chuck
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson and John Fike at Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the focus of our work is on application
technology to begin with, to have good
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology for seed treatment and coding
technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a laboratory scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unit called a rotary pan technology,
an R6 for a six inch diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same technology is used for commercial
scale equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that we do in the laboratory
can quickly be scaled up to a larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: An issue that we had early on is that we
need to ensure that we have uniformity of
[SPEAKER_01]: application over the seed surface and from
seed to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to protect each seed from attack
on the soil-borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: At time of sowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a step back and look at the
biological market as there's a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is not restricted to seed
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: These could be foliar applications or soil
applications and furrow applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have bio-fertilizers and
bio-stimulants, which we're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though my laboratory is working with
bio-stimulant seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to focus on biological control
products and particularly the
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to kind of focus in on that
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under the bio-pesticides, we have
biochemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be kind of a mineral based.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be either formed from copper or
phosphites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have examples of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We normally think of a microbial as a
bio-pesticide, but they're not the only
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, we are using specific
seed treatments from bacillus and
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma and with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are commercial formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we are testing as seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our list of 12 seed treatments
that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those in green are the biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing we have to do is test the seed
treatment application rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to ensure that there's no
phytotoxicity from the seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those in red are the biochemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safeguard is an organic copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prudent is a phosphite material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the group at the bottom in blue
apron XL maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably recognize as these are widely
labeled on vegetables and field crops for
[SPEAKER_01]: as seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first let's look at what happens to
seeds after they're planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start off here in the laboratory to
look at hemp seeds germinate very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this pathogen infested soil that we
have the soil sprinkled over on top during
[SPEAKER_01]: the germination process after four days
the seeds germinate very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: After seven days, many of the seedlings
have died or are dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by 10 days, non-treated seeds are
killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a way that we can use a
laboratory screening method.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take an advantage of a naturally
pathogen infested soil to go ahead and to
[SPEAKER_01]: test these seed treatments before we
actually go to the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our primary interest and shelf view
today is the field data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two field studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Cornell, the first one planted on June
12th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, now we can see how this color
coding is going to help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black bar on the left is the control
non-treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see all the green treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the biological is doing any better
than the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the safeguard, the organic
copper, the prudent, the phosphite doing
[SPEAKER_01]: quite well and is good as one of our best
apron maximum treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this looks very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a second study also in Ithaca this
year planted on June 26th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same trend is the biological is
not performing any better than the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-treated control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are seeing improvements with both the
safeguard and particularly the safeguard
[SPEAKER_01]: and the prudent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's comparable to our best
apron maximum treatment as the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where Gary's laboratory was
instrumental in supporting this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would see the symptoms in the field as
far as diseased seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: His laboratory has done the
characterization of what pathogens are
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with those diseased seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see here in the picture on the
photo at the bottom on the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: indicative of those testing positive for
fusarium species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture on the lower right,
having pythium species present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary's laboratory is still ongoing work to
characterize the species of these along
[SPEAKER_01]: with other samples that we have provided
to their lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, this is a multi-state project
and being a multi-state project is good in
[SPEAKER_01]: that we do not want to simply have seeds
that are tested in Cornell that only have
[SPEAKER_01]: good control in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've expanded the test testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seed testing at Virginia Tech in
the southern region and then North Dakota
[SPEAKER_01]: State in the north central region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same color coding and the same
scheme as we had in our previous slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see safeguard and prudent doing very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from one study we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be one more study coming with
data this fall from Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then North Dakota State.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we're seeing the chemical
seed treatments doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one across the board,
but still we're seeing, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: safeguard doing a nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gathering information now and the
very good picture is that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: some consistency in our results from field
to field and from location to location
[SPEAKER_01]: within the regions of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and summarize where
we're at with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biochemical seed treatments,
the safeguard, which was the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: copper and the prudent, which is a
phosphite, had good efficacy in all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, the data that we have in hand at
this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemical seed treatments, Apron XL and
Maxon still had good efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are tried and true
chemical seed treatments that are widely
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, after two years,
two years of work where Syngenta was
[SPEAKER_01]: initially very interested in this project,
Syngenta is no longer providing support
[SPEAKER_01]: for hemp on any particular application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be Syngenta herbicides and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be supporting those
hemp labels in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a big setback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need other chemical seed
treatments from another company to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking into that at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the biologicals, and we've done
now two years in a row trying to test a
[SPEAKER_01]: good range of commercially available and
use biological seed treatments,
[SPEAKER_01]: simply were not effective in our study to
control damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank people.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, in my laboratory,
Hilary Maton, Hilary kind of headed up all
[SPEAKER_01]: the field studies that you had as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as gathering data from the other
states and then summarizing some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: data in the graphs that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Luce in my laboratory has done all
the seed treatment application,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the in-house testing as far as
germination, soil testing and our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: bioassay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Masi has done a lot of the photographic
work and other support work for this
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very nice team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very fortunate to have people working
with me on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Gary's laboratory, Jen Star was really
instrumental in working with Hilary taking
[SPEAKER_01]: those field samples and doing the
characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin in Gary's lab is helping at the
molecular characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what species are involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we work very closely with the
company registrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the companies that
actually are producing these, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working directly with our R&D people to
make sure that we're testing the best
[SPEAKER_01]: biological, chemical, biochemical
treatment that they would have available
[SPEAKER_01]: for this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I want to thank support from
IR4, but in particular for New York Ag and
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets for their continued support for
this and for other Cornell hemp projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks very much, Alan.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to move on now because we
have three short presentations from some
[SPEAKER_13]: of my colleagues in Cornell Cooperative
Extension talking about their work on the
[SPEAKER_13]: economics and supply chains, starting with
John Hanchar.
[SPEAKER_12]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is John Hanchar.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am with Cornell University and a member
of the Cornell University Hemp Group that
[SPEAKER_12]: is stunning hemp production in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lindsay Paschow and Mary Ulrich,
also with Cornell University, and I've
[SPEAKER_12]: been doing research and extension work on
the economic aspects of growing hemp in
[SPEAKER_12]: New York.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lindsay, Mary and I will be presenting
update type information from an economics
[SPEAKER_12]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_12]: Based upon our cost of production work,
I will describe the economic environment,
[SPEAKER_12]: the market signals, which growers
considered earlier in the year regarding
[SPEAKER_12]: planting decisions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lindsay will then provide update
information for processing retail and
[SPEAKER_12]: consumer activities.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mary will discuss what do growers need to
be thinking of to obtain viable hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: enterprises.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cost of production and expected prices are
key determinants of growers planting
[SPEAKER_12]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Should I produce or not?
[SPEAKER_12]: If production makes sense, then how much
should I plan to supply at expected
[SPEAKER_12]: prices?
[SPEAKER_12]: Acreage and production input decisions are
involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: Item one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Figure one contains information produced
by Cornell University and others.
[SPEAKER_12]: For Cornell University resources,
please see hemp.cals.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cornell analysis for a plastic culture
system suggests variable costs and total
[SPEAKER_12]: costs equal $12,600 and $13,100 per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Cornell work excludes a charge for the
value of management inputs required and
[SPEAKER_12]: reflects pre-planting inputs, tasked to
the point where dry materials in totes
[SPEAKER_12]: ready for immediate delivery or ready for
storage and future delivery.
[SPEAKER_12]: Item two.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other studies use similar cost of
production methods, but the item is
[SPEAKER_12]: included in time periods considered
different.
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, the University of Connecticut
values include a charge for management
[SPEAKER_12]: inputs required, various marketing
expenses and others.
[SPEAKER_12]: Variable costs for the five study range
from $8,800 to $13,400 per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: The five study average was $12,200 per
acre for the variable cost measure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Total costs ranged from $9,200 to $19,300
per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: The five study average was $14,000 per
acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: Item three.
[SPEAKER_12]: Calculated breakeven prices and expected
prices received that would cover variable
[SPEAKER_12]: and total costs using the five study
averages equaled 1.31 and 1.51 dollars per
[SPEAKER_12]: percent CBD per pound of dry matter
respectively.
[SPEAKER_12]: Given percent CBD equals six, dry matter
per plant equal one pound and harvested
[SPEAKER_12]: plants per acre equaled 1,550 plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Expected prices for the 2020 growing and
harvest year, late 2019 of about a dollar
[SPEAKER_12]: and early 2020 about 65 cents relative to
cost suggest a relatively unfavorable
[SPEAKER_12]: economic environment for hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Item four.
[SPEAKER_12]: In summary, there are three aspects that
this information supports.
[SPEAKER_12]: An unfavorable economic environment,
unfavorable market signals was being
[SPEAKER_12]: considered by growers as they made
planting decisions early in the year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially when compared to expectations
for alternative horticulture crops.
[SPEAKER_12]: Risks and uncertainties still concern
growers.
[SPEAKER_12]: A comment by Mary Ulrich, CCE Eastern New
York Horticulture Program during a recent
[SPEAKER_12]: Cornell University Hemp Check-in call
summarizes the environment quite well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Activity, that is hemp production,
is a fraction of what it was last year in
[SPEAKER_12]: the area.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have questions or comments,
you can contact me, John Hanchar at jjh6
[SPEAKER_12]: at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to move on to Lindsey
Paschow's presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Lindsey Paschow and I'm on
Cornell Cooperative Extension's Harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: New York team.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be discussing the supply chain for
industrial hemp in New York State with
[SPEAKER_07]: discussions about state of processors,
a little bit about retailers and
[SPEAKER_07]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: In May 2020, a survey was sent out to the
hemp processors in New York State to find
[SPEAKER_07]: out what the state of hemp processing
happened in 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of a little over 100 processors in New
York State, only 24 responded.
[SPEAKER_07]: 13 said that they did process hemp in New
York State and 11 said that they did not.
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked how much hemp did you process in
2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: 11 respondents did not process any hemp
and then the hemp ranged between zero and
[SPEAKER_07]: 28,278 pounds with a total of 122,088
pounds processed in New York State,
[SPEAKER_07]: according to the respondents.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2019, we asked what the minimum CBD
content that hemp processors required from
[SPEAKER_07]: their growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ranged anywhere from zero to 12% of CBD
percentage they would like from growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we asked processors what they were
processing hemp into.
[SPEAKER_07]: This included hemp oil, seed cake,
biofuel, plastic raw materials,
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp fiber, pellets, and that was for
pellet stoves, extracts such as powders,
[SPEAKER_07]: base oil, protein, tinctures, flour,
and CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2020, we wanted to know what processors
were looking at for their capacity for
[SPEAKER_07]: processing hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: The range is all over the board.
[SPEAKER_07]: But included weekly basis of 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some processors said for a month,
they could only do about two acres or
[SPEAKER_07]: anywhere between 1,000 and 140,000 pounds
with also some processors responding that
[SPEAKER_07]: they could do anywhere from 6,000 to a
million pounds within the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot of information out there
in New York State about the state of
[SPEAKER_07]: retailers and consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will probably be potentially a future
survey to find out from retailers and
[SPEAKER_07]: consumers where the industry is.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of predictions online about
how retail stores might end up closing
[SPEAKER_07]: because of COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people can buy CBD locally or
they can buy it online.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the retail side is very unpredictable
and so is on the consumer side.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's large predictions that CBD
consumption will continue to increase
[SPEAKER_07]: between 2020 and 2024.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any other questions about hemp
processors in New York State, please feel
[SPEAKER_07]: free to reach out to me on my email
address.
[SPEAKER_07]: My email address is LEP67 at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Mary Ulrich with Cornell Cooperative
Extension in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_15]: I too am on the hemp team and I'm going to
address a little bit about risk and reward
[SPEAKER_15]: because of course the question this year
is the reward of hemp, the potential for
[SPEAKER_15]: profit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Balance out with the risk because those
two things should be in direct proportion
[SPEAKER_15]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they may not be.
[SPEAKER_15]: Has hemp been all rainbows and kittens or
is it a little wild westy?
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen a lot of wild westy out there in
the last couple of years and so I'm going
[SPEAKER_15]: to address a couple of ways to protect
yourself from the bad actors and other
[SPEAKER_15]: potential negatives that occur.
[SPEAKER_15]: How is risk measured and mitigated?
[SPEAKER_15]: We use cost of production data.
[SPEAKER_15]: John mentioned that it's coming along but
the future market certainly is
[SPEAKER_15]: questionable.
[SPEAKER_15]: We certainly do need more interest from
consumers to keep that price up,
[SPEAKER_15]: to keep the demand up.
[SPEAKER_15]: We also mitigate risk with crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what the payments,
I haven't talked to anybody who signed up
[SPEAKER_15]: for crop insurance and I mean the USDA,
FSA crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know what those payments are
going to be for 2020.
[SPEAKER_15]: My prediction last year was that they were
either going to be really good or really
[SPEAKER_15]: bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we'll see what happens with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm always curious to talk to people
who've had insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you've had insurance, please give me
a ring because private or the federal
[SPEAKER_15]: government supported ones that would be,
I'd love that information.
[SPEAKER_15]: So and also one way to protect yourself or
to mitigate risk is to have a contract.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course with the 2018 farm bill
going to be brought into effect in New
[SPEAKER_15]: York State by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's lots of changes in the landscape
happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course we're not used to
legislation changing so quickly around
[SPEAKER_15]: crops.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the last few years this has been quite
a little roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that in itself is a risk that you don't
know where things are going to go
[SPEAKER_15]: legislatively.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course the big force majeure or the big
risk is that FDA may decide to regulate
[SPEAKER_15]: the crop, particularly in the case of CBD.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that could have a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_15]: On markets, production, if FDA said no,
no, this is a drug and everybody has to
[SPEAKER_15]: have, just like a drug, everybody has to
have the same kind of testing and
[SPEAKER_15]: monitoring, then there would be a lot of
producers and processors that would no
[SPEAKER_15]: longer have a market because they couldn't
meet those requirements.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the other thing I just want to say
about contracts, if it sounds too good to
[SPEAKER_15]: be true, it probably is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to show you a flyer in a
minute that can help you out in terms of
[SPEAKER_15]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's the biggest thing that I see as
a problem with hemp contracts or hemp
[SPEAKER_15]: relationships right now is that there's no
collective knowledge.
[SPEAKER_15]: For produce we have the blue book so that
people can go look up buyers in New York
[SPEAKER_15]: State.
[SPEAKER_15]: Buyers are bonded so that if a seller
doesn't get paid, they can go to the state
[SPEAKER_15]: and get reimbursed through that bonding
process.
[SPEAKER_15]: If, you know, they really didn't get paid
for something that they sold and
[SPEAKER_15]: everything was supposed to be okay and the
seller just didn't get their money,
[SPEAKER_15]: there's a way to get it back.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in hemp that doesn't exist right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's no institutional memory,
which we should have or we have in other
[SPEAKER_15]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know who is going to pay you.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know who the traditional bad actors
are.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know the guys who pay in 36 to 90 and
the ones who don't.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't know, your neighbors do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so sharing information about that in
other crops has been very open and hemp it
[SPEAKER_15]: has not been.
[SPEAKER_15]: So even what little institutional memory
is being gathered, it's not being shared.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it seems like bad actors are going
from farm to farm or from region to region
[SPEAKER_15]: and causing trouble.
[SPEAKER_15]: And certainly this isn't just about CBD.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had it happen that folks selling
grain came to me because they didn't get
[SPEAKER_15]: paid for their grain because the buyer
said that it was moldy but didn't tell me
[SPEAKER_15]: it was moldy until like three months
later.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's no way to trace back whose
fault that was.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just very unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so also very unusual relationships
between value and cost that the farmer
[SPEAKER_15]: needs to buy into the processing somehow,
which is really, you know, not the case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ocean spray, you know, really doesn't need
the farmers necessarily to buy into the
[SPEAKER_15]: processing part itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: They might be a co-op in terms of selling,
but do they own the equipment?
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or orange juice companies or any of those.
[SPEAKER_15]: There isn't that same kind of need to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of interest from people who
have never been involved in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: That can be a little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also what I call the billionaire
rule.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of folks running around
saying, oh, I have billionaire friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, unless you see a picture of him with
Warren Buffett, like on his Christmas
[SPEAKER_15]: card, don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the local growers actually said,
if it's a good party, it'll still be going
[SPEAKER_15]: in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's a bad party, I never wanted to
go in the first place.
[SPEAKER_15]: He said that one question about why he was
because he was going to grow and then
[SPEAKER_15]: changed his mind in the last minute and
19.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just using caution.
[SPEAKER_15]: So to try and look more closely at some of
those contract details, there's this six
[SPEAKER_15]: page pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_15]: The first two pages are about production
stuff, but then the next four about
[SPEAKER_15]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wrote it with the assistance of several
attorneys, agricultural attorneys.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just have a look at that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on both the Cornell website and the
hemp blog, which here's the pages.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the blog is on the left.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's regular news updates there
and updates for meetings and things like
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also the link for the contract
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the right, don't forget that
Cornell has its own website.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the team, whether it's other
people you've heard from today or John or
[SPEAKER_15]: Lindsay or myself, all of our contact
information is also on there on the team
[SPEAKER_15]: website.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, John, Lindsay and Mary.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're running a little bit over time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see Chris Logue is there ready to
make his presentation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm going to suggest if people can
stay on is we will extend our Q&A session
[SPEAKER_13]: that will start at around 11 55 beyond 12
o'clock if people can stay on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can ask questions to John,
Lindsay and Mary.
[SPEAKER_13]: But now I would like to move on to Chris
Logue, Director of Plant Industry at New
[SPEAKER_13]: York State Department of Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Larry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_17]: Trying a new headset today.
[SPEAKER_17]: So good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the first thing I really should should
say is thank you very much, Larry,
[SPEAKER_17]: for having us here today to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I want to compliment you on
a on a fantastic program today and also
[SPEAKER_17]: the fantastic research program in the
great communication on industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_17]: back and forth with the department,
as well as with the growers in New York
[SPEAKER_17]: State, as well as in other states.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, everybody, everybody should have
received a letter or all of our registered
[SPEAKER_17]: research partners should have received a
letter via email earlier this week.
[SPEAKER_17]: That letter should also be making its way
through the postal service as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to be sure that we sent that out
multiple ways so that folks would would
[SPEAKER_17]: get the message as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: We really spent the last six or eight
months here in the department,
[SPEAKER_17]: working on and looking at what the
requirements of the 2018 Farm Bill program
[SPEAKER_17]: were.
[SPEAKER_17]: As many of you, you know, know,
we sent in comments on the federal interim
[SPEAKER_17]: rule.
[SPEAKER_17]: You all sent in many comments.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of commonality among those
comments and identified a number of
[SPEAKER_17]: barriers related to hemp for growers going
forward under the 2018 rules, as well as
[SPEAKER_17]: for states going forward under the 2018
rules.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had an informal deadline.
[SPEAKER_17]: With USDA AMS, the states did as far as
submitting plans for consideration.
[SPEAKER_17]: That deadline was August 15th.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were deliberating here within the
agency and outside the agency,
[SPEAKER_17]: frankly, right up until that August 15th
deadline about what direction to go in.
[SPEAKER_17]: Our decision at that time was that we were
unable to submit a compliant plan to USDA,
[SPEAKER_17]: which sets the stage for USDA to be the
regulatory authority for hemp here in New
[SPEAKER_17]: York State.
[SPEAKER_17]: The authority of the 2014 Farm Bill,
which is what we're operating on right
[SPEAKER_17]: now, you all know expires on 10-31-2020.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our intention to run a 2014 compliant
program up until that sunsets in October
[SPEAKER_17]: of this year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_17]: That federal interim rule has many aspects
that are inconsistent with what we believe
[SPEAKER_17]: the congressional intent was when the 2018
Farm Bill was passed.
[SPEAKER_17]: We think that intent was in line with what
our beliefs here in New York have been,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is to consider that industrial hemp
is an agricultural commodity and that the
[SPEAKER_17]: Farm Bill was really to continue to
stimulate and develop the industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the things that we found
particularly difficult to deal with were
[SPEAKER_17]: the testing requirements and the
destruction requirements.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a number of other issues that we
and others, including growers in New York
[SPEAKER_17]: and other states, have identified that are
problematic.
[SPEAKER_17]: We feel that the interpretation of this
section of the Farm Bill and the
[SPEAKER_17]: corresponding sections of the federal
interim rule really show that they've been
[SPEAKER_17]: most likely heavily influenced by
Department of Justice and the DEA.
[SPEAKER_17]: Had a number of conversations over the
past several months with USDA regarding
[SPEAKER_17]: what the legal boundaries are for a state
hemp program and what could or would be
[SPEAKER_17]: approved in a hemp plan and what the
required regulatory activities would be.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the final analysis, the components of
an approved state plan are essentially the
[SPEAKER_17]: same as federal oversight of the program.
[SPEAKER_17]: In short, the rules are the same after
10-31, whether the state or the federal
[SPEAKER_17]: government is the primary authority.
[SPEAKER_17]: States that sign on for being the primary
regulatory authority are really operating
[SPEAKER_17]: as agents, if you will, of the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_17]: Our feeling is that submission of a
compliant plan really is an affirmation
[SPEAKER_17]: that the state agrees with the federal
interim rule and it certainly legally
[SPEAKER_17]: obligates us to carry out the plan as
submitted.
[SPEAKER_17]: Submitting a compliant plan with the
intent of not following it really is,
[SPEAKER_17]: in our opinion, a disingenuous act.
[SPEAKER_17]: We think that by not submitting a plan to
USDA, New York State is really sending a
[SPEAKER_17]: clear message to USDA that the
requirements are unworkable and
[SPEAKER_17]: unnecessarily burdensome to the states and
the growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: We feel as though there are several states
that are on the cusp of following us in
[SPEAKER_17]: this action of not sending in a plan and
not at liberty right now to name
[SPEAKER_17]: particular states that are considering
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to respect their sovereignty and
respect their decision-making process in
[SPEAKER_17]: that, but we do believe that you'll see
some other states that take this action as
[SPEAKER_17]: well going forward.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to transition a little bit to the
letters that we sent to USDA as well as
[SPEAKER_17]: the ones that we sent out to our research
partners.
[SPEAKER_17]: Both letters reference our strong
commitment to hemp in New York State.
[SPEAKER_17]: We as a department, as an agency,
and I think as a state government,
[SPEAKER_17]: we're all still very much committed to
hemp as well as its economic potential for
[SPEAKER_17]: New York farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was very interested to see and hear the
economic analysis that John Hanchar and
[SPEAKER_17]: Lindsay and Mary presented earlier here
today.
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw some of the comments in the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this industry is having growing
pains, clearly, but it still clearly has a
[SPEAKER_17]: lot of potential for New York producers as
well as others.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where are we right now?
[SPEAKER_17]: Getting back to our commitment to growers,
we stand ready to assist our hemp growers
[SPEAKER_17]: with the transition to federal licensing
structure.
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to have that be in the most
seamless and orderly way possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do everything in our
control to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing that I think has really been a
fantastic thing about the hemp program
[SPEAKER_17]: here in New York and I think in other
parts of the country, and it's a real
[SPEAKER_17]: positive thing, is the enthusiasm and the
entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_17]: What we've seen in New York is that
enthusiasm and entrepreneurship really has
[SPEAKER_17]: led to a lot of specific nuances in your
business.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a great thing that some of those
nuances perhaps complicate the transition
[SPEAKER_17]: over to the USDA program, but we are
certainly going to work with you to get
[SPEAKER_17]: you into that program in the best way
possible with the least legal and
[SPEAKER_17]: financial risk.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to also continue to advocate
for adjustments in the federal program in
[SPEAKER_17]: a more flexible regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple things, just to talk a little bit
about some general information with the
[SPEAKER_17]: transition over to the federal side of
things.
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing that again is a really positive
is that actually one of our staff people
[SPEAKER_17]: here at the department took a position
with the USDA program.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have really a very strong relationship
with the folks at AMS because of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have really good communications
with the folks at AMS because of that
[SPEAKER_17]: connection with our former staff person.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had some initial conversations about
what we think this looks like.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a couple of general things that we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, there are a lot of specific
questions that need to be answered.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to work through those over the
next weeks to help you out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a typical field grower, as we've had
the conversation with USDA, that typical
[SPEAKER_17]: field grower should probably plan on
having their harvest complete by the end
[SPEAKER_17]: of the 2014 Farm Bill Authority and then
proceed to register with the USDA.
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you're registered with the USDA,
you're going to be subject to the federal
[SPEAKER_17]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_17]: Our understanding is that you cannot have
the federal license and the state
[SPEAKER_17]: registration at the same time.
[SPEAKER_17]: You also want to have all of your testing
of the current year's crop done and in
[SPEAKER_17]: hand before that happens.
[SPEAKER_17]: The complicating factors are going to be
places that are growing plants for
[SPEAKER_17]: planting or perhaps that have their plants
in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to work closely with those
folks.
[SPEAKER_17]: Couple things on sampling.
[SPEAKER_17]: The USDA program does not require the
sampler or the lab at this point to be DEA
[SPEAKER_17]: registered at this time.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in the original version of the
interim rule, they did have that
[SPEAKER_17]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_17]: We think this potentially creates some
opportunity for some service providers in
[SPEAKER_17]: the state, whether they be soil and water
conservation folks or certified crop
[SPEAKER_17]: advisors or perhaps organic certifiers to
help out with the sampling requirements.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're told that there are some good
training resources for potential samplers
[SPEAKER_17]: on the USDA website.
[SPEAKER_17]: A little bit here quickly on the federal
application process and reporting under
[SPEAKER_17]: the federal program.
[SPEAKER_17]: The first step in the federal process is
going to be to get your FBI background
[SPEAKER_17]: check.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to have that in hand at the time
of application.
[SPEAKER_17]: It can be no older than 60 days old when
it's submitted to the USDA.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm told that USDA is having some
interactions with New York growers that
[SPEAKER_17]: some of the issues around the postal
service right now are creating a little
[SPEAKER_17]: bit of a delay in background checks.
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a web-based service that can do a
background check, which is, I'm told,
[SPEAKER_17]: more expensive.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's $50 rather than $18.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we'll try to get that information
linked up on our website soon.
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you've got the background check and
plan in hand, I should say, you would fill
[SPEAKER_17]: out your application.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a one pager.
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no fee associated with that
application.
[SPEAKER_17]: It would get submitted to USDA.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in conversations with USDA about
whether those applications should be
[SPEAKER_17]: coming in right now or whether they should
be held until November 1st.
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that is a factor in this
is as other states make a similar decision
[SPEAKER_17]: to what the decision that we made here,
their licensing volume is going to
[SPEAKER_17]: increase.
[SPEAKER_17]: Either way, what we think will happen is
that the licenses on the federal side will
[SPEAKER_17]: be issued with an effective date of
November 1st, 2020.
[SPEAKER_17]: Once the license is reviewed or the
application is reviewed on the federal
[SPEAKER_17]: side, the successful applicant is going to
receive the license document.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then you would need to go to the local
USDA FSA service center to register your
[SPEAKER_17]: specific production locations.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm told that that information is going to
then be shared with law enforcement
[SPEAKER_17]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_17]: My experience with FSA is that they have
very robust GIS capabilities, and so that
[SPEAKER_17]: may actually result in some better
communication with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple things where we'll still be
involved here at Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, we still see a very strong role
for us here around the issues around seed
[SPEAKER_17]: quality, seed certification.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked quite a bit with some of the
seed suppliers about being in compliance
[SPEAKER_17]: with the seed laws.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll also continue to work on plant
health and plant quality issues.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're a producer who is selling hemp
transplants to other entities,
[SPEAKER_17]: you would continue to maintain your
nursery grower registration with us.
[SPEAKER_17]: You would continue to have an inspection
once per two-year licensing cycle to
[SPEAKER_17]: document the health of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have a long list of questions to
answer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I want to reaffirm the commitment
we have to all of you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know following my presentation here or
my comments here, we've got one of my
[SPEAKER_17]: colleagues, Pat, with the Department of
Health who's going to talk about where
[SPEAKER_17]: we're going on processing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Please keep in mind we're here to help
you.
[SPEAKER_17]: To make this transition as pain-free and
easy as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to say that I appreciate very
much the great way that all of our field
[SPEAKER_17]: staff and inspectors has been treated by
this industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a real pleasure working with all
of you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll continue to work with you and help
you in any way that we can.
[SPEAKER_17]: As always, we're here for you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it has been a great research
partnership with New York State Ag and
[SPEAKER_13]: Markets.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope to find a way to continue that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that your name is still listed
on the USDA AMS website as the contact for
[SPEAKER_13]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: I sent an email this morning to USDA to
try to find out who our contact will be
[SPEAKER_13]: with USDA in New York State when we have
questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the questions in the chat box
right now refer to the future of CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: processing and processing licensing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am just going to move right on to Pat
McKeach from the Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_13]: He can describe what the future of CBD
processing regulations will be in New York
[SPEAKER_13]: State.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Pat McKeach and I work for the
New York State Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of the team here setting up the
cannabinoid hemp program.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Chris was, I'd like to echo what Chris
was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been an absolutely phenomenal
presentation this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learned so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to Larry for inviting us and
allowing us to give an update on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid hemp program here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we were hoping that the
regulations were going to be out by now so
[SPEAKER_02]: we could get a little bit more into the
meat and potatoes of what the program will
[SPEAKER_02]: look like, but we are being told that
they're at the last stage of approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping they'll be out within the
next couple of weeks here, which will give
[SPEAKER_02]: a clearer picture of everything that will
be in the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to highlight that there's a
public comment period associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: those regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are obviously involved in the
industry, studying the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: experts in hemp and what's the cutting
edge movement now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely encourage you guys to send
comments because we're not going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything right the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Viewing this more as a partnership will
definitely help us make the best
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid hemp program we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're up to now 16 different
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have their own unique cannabinoid
hemp or CBD regulations out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a rapidly developing
regulatory framework right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a patchwork of different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: We borrowed a little bit from others.
[SPEAKER_02]: We borrowed a little bit from the dietary
supplement industry, from the food
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping just to make something that
works and is flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting started today, I just want to talk
a little bit about the legislative
[SPEAKER_02]: background, the history of how the bill
came to pass and why it was placed at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Health medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go over the program objectives for
what we're trying to accomplish here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A brief description of the different
license types between processors and
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the product standards that we're
trying to hold these to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really building off of the great
work that Ag and Markets has already done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a quick timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next steps so we can telegraph what the
next three to six months will look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of you are probably aware,
a bill passed in early 2020 establishing a
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp program in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Chris just mentioned in the last
segment there, the USDA will actually be
[SPEAKER_02]: regulating cultivation for the 2021 grow
season due to the cumbersome requirements
[SPEAKER_02]: for the interim final rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the processing and retailing of
cannabinoid hemp will be going over to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it was really placed there to build
off the expertise that had been developed
[SPEAKER_02]: from regulating the medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of synergies in terms of how
the plant is extracted, packaging and
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling requirements, manufacturing
requirements, testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figured it would be a good place to
merge and always thinking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: taxpayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing some resources here so we can get
a good head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to highlight this first sub bullet
here about the transition from a research
[SPEAKER_02]: program to a traditional license program
because it is really significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Ag and Markets first developed their
program back in 2015, it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on what we heard today in the
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all of a sudden, CBD exploded and
everyone wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wanted to process it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became much more about the
marketability and the commercialization
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of hemp, which is great,
but under a research program, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: limited in the relationship between the
regulator and the licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under this new framework, we're hoping
that we can really grow and help develop
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp industry in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoid hemp is defined, as any
product that is used for its cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: content for human consumption or topical
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp seed oil, hemp protein powder,
those are GRAS, they're regulated as food.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would still be under Ag and Markets
purview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Industrial applications and bioplastic
textiles, that's not part of the scope of
[SPEAKER_02]: the program either.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really focused on things that are
being sold for their cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_02]: and being ingested in the human body or
applied to the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to highlight that it was a
conscious choice to use cannabinoid rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than calling it the CPD program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we heard from the panels this
morning, CBG is getting big, terpenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: those come up daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to comment on it,
but I'm seeing a bunch of articles about
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta-8 THC and what the 2018 farm bill
might have done to impact that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always interesting to be involved in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're really trying to do here at the
Department of Health in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: objectives is the first one here is we
just want to comprehensively regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid hemp products in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were drafting the regulations and
we were talking to people in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: or just people in New York State,
there's so much ambiguity right now and
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the lack of federal guidance
that some of the most common questions are
[SPEAKER_02]: just like what's allowed and what's not
allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely one of the main focuses
of the program is just trying to provide a
[SPEAKER_02]: clear baseline of what will be allowed in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second bullet point here is definitely
a huge pillar, especially for us at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumer protection and quality control
standards are a huge, huge aspect of the
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that products on the
shelf have been tested, are labeled
[SPEAKER_02]: properly, and manufactured to a certain
standard and give consumers some assurance
[SPEAKER_02]: that when they're buying something,
it actually contains cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not getting ripped off and they
have the appropriate warnings or
[SPEAKER_02]: disclosures of what's in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tied into that is this last point about
education and enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely understand that you can have
the best rules in the world, but if people
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't following them or they're not being
enforced, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So education and enforcement are going to
be a really key pillar of the program and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're small now, but we're hoping that we
can ramp up in terms of resources over the
[SPEAKER_02]: next few years and dedicate a lot of those
resources to that effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a quick overview of the license types
in the new program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We split the processor into two different
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the extraction and
manufacturing license and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing only license.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key difference here is really the
extractor license because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using different equipment and
different technologies and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: different level of risk for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be its own kind of
license type, assuming that not every
[SPEAKER_02]: business will want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the manufacturing only license
will be businesses who are purchasing kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of that intermediary product that's
already been extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your isolates, distillates,
whole plant extracts, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing a product from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really just the idea there was just
allowing different opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses to enter the supply chain based
on their business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last license here is the hemp
retailer license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our idea here is really to make it more of
a permit or a registration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a way for the department to
kind of get some insight into where these
[SPEAKER_02]: products are being sold and then also gets
our foot in the door so we can start
[SPEAKER_02]: educating these retailers about,
you know, how to source a quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid hemp product, what to look for
on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it been tested?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it say how many milligrams of CBD are
in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, you know, we'll have a
piece of paper that says, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you agreed that you were going to check
for the X, Y, and Z and you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll kind of help us on the
enforcement side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, there's potentially
10,000 places in New York state that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be selling cannabinoid products within the
first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the product standards, for those of you
who are research partners in the Ag and
[SPEAKER_02]: Markets program right now, a lot of these
bullet points should look really familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chris, for creating a great
program over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plagiarized, copied, and stole a lot of
good ideas from that program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to manufacturing,
you know, we don't want to reinvent the
[SPEAKER_02]: wheel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already good regulations out there
in terms of good manufacturing processes
[SPEAKER_02]: for both food and dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of want to build off that as a
foundation and then layer on those
[SPEAKER_02]: additional concerns that are unique to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So packaging and labeling is a great
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is such a new industry,
it's all about consumer awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure the consumer knows
what they're putting in their body,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a QR code so they can check that
the product has been tested and labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then warnings and disclosures are also
extremely important, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about, you know,
a false effect from product that could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially cause someone to fail a drug
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be upfront about that
information because that could affect
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking to add things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to laboratory testing,
we're going with the 17.025 ISO
[SPEAKER_02]: accreditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other states are also going with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's popular in the medical
marijuana and adult use industry as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of building off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as these programs grow, the quality of
the third party lab sector should also
[SPEAKER_02]: grow with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be definitely a work in
progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're requiring a full panel of testing
for cannabinoid hemp products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, similar to the medical marijuana
and the adult use standards, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're still putting it in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be tested for, you know,
residual solvents, microbials,
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really is the program in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to highlight again that the
regulations should be out relatively soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely encourage everyone to give
feedback on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to highlight that they are
proposed regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things will not be written in stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have opportunities to make changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And new licenses should be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're shooting for early.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the processor side and the retail
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please be on the lookout for additional
information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on setting up a cannabinoid
hemp website so we can post some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff online and also setting up a call
center number so we can take your calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a shared email that's on my
next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can share that at the end here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But quickly, the last point here is we
also are working in tandem with Ag and
[SPEAKER_02]: Market on the transition of existing
research partners over to the DOH program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really want to make that as seamless
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I already mentioned, a lot of the
requirements will be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll kind of just be working out those
who are operating, those who are not
[SPEAKER_02]: operating and getting all the boxes
checked on the application to make it as
[SPEAKER_02]: seamless as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, thank you to Cornell for
letting us give this update.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to contact us, we're more than
happy to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email is hemp at health.nyork.gov.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will kick it back to Larry now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, Pat.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very close to the scheduled time of
completing our field day, but I want to go
[SPEAKER_13]: another 15 minutes or so to try to let
mainly you and Chris answer some of these
[SPEAKER_13]: questions if you can.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the main questions I've seen is how
will USDA define a grower or producer?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the landowner or would it be
someone who's renting the land?
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, Chris, do you have an idea?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure I can answer that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Larry, I think my sense is that it's
going to be very similar to how we defined
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, these are all details that we
need to work through with them.
[SPEAKER_17]: But my sense is it's the farmer.
[SPEAKER_17]: The landowner is registered with them and
then the locations get registered through
[SPEAKER_17]: farm service agency.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan is asking who needs to have the FBI
identity history summary.
[SPEAKER_13]: My reading of that was it was the
principals of the firm, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would agree with that, yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So not necessarily all of the staff or
investors.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course at Cornell University,
we are in discussion with our general
[SPEAKER_13]: counsel because the principal of Cornell
University is our president and our board
[SPEAKER_13]: of trustees.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, I think we crossed that bridge
ourselves on that a while ago,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Between the state and Cornell.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just got an email from our general
counsel saying, Larry, you're going to
[SPEAKER_13]: apply as an individual, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Another question that has come up quite a
bit from Pat and we get this question
[SPEAKER_13]: quite a bit is, will Department of Health
be regulating smokable flower?
[SPEAKER_13]: What will the regulation of that look like
under the DOH program?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I will make the caveat that our
regulations are not final yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all subject to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when they're posted, they're
still subject to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time, we are looking for a
pathway to allow flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we are going to restrict the
forms that can be sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no pre-rolls, no hemp cigars,
no cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really done from a public
health perspective to not really encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: the combustion of these products and then
recognizing that they are available in
[SPEAKER_02]: other states and online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also other uses such as hemp
teas and throwing them in a flower or
[SPEAKER_02]: making your own edibles at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this time, that is the direction
we're heading.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please be on the lookout for those
final regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another question, I think, for Chris,
although maybe not a Division of Plant
[SPEAKER_13]: Industry question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we extend our New York grown and
certified status to our hemp crop and
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid products?
[SPEAKER_17]: So not a plant industry question,
Larry.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to kick that to one of our
folks in Ag Development and certainly can
[SPEAKER_17]: try to get an answer to that for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I've seen questions regarding
holding material after November 1st.
[SPEAKER_13]: So will you need to be licensed with USDA
to hold, let's say, dried hemp material?
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, if you have clones growing in
your greenhouse on November 1st,
[SPEAKER_13]: as we will have, we need to have a USDA
license.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what about tested harvested material?
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've actually, as we've been kind of
participating in this webinar today,
[SPEAKER_17]: we've been having some side conversations
with USDA with some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to try to get a firm
answer on that.
[SPEAKER_17]: The initial answer we have on that is that
anything that is out of the ground,
[SPEAKER_17]: harvested, tested before October 31st
should be to the state standard.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that is still in the ground and
the testing and such is not completed by
[SPEAKER_17]: October 31st goes to the federal standard.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think one of the things that we really
need to get a bead on, Larry, is I know
[SPEAKER_17]: there's some product out there that has
been stored for a longer period of time
[SPEAKER_17]: that folks are waiting, frankly,
for better market conditions.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we need to get a sense of that because
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I know that our former staff person
who now works for USDA understands that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure people higher up the chain in
USDA have a sense of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can work on that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pat, there's a question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you talk about the application process
for retailers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually, we're in the process
now of developing an online application
[SPEAKER_02]: for that, trying to make it kind of as
easy as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not meant to be really a barrier of
entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really more of a permit or
registration at which you can kind of just
[SPEAKER_02]: get an idea of where these places are
being sold and then can provide some
[SPEAKER_02]: education to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similar to the processor licenses,
we're hoping to roll that out in early
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a question.
[SPEAKER_13]: What will the mechanism of enforcement be
for non-compliant hemp products in New
[SPEAKER_13]: York State beginning in 21?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a question for you, Pat.
[SPEAKER_13]: How is DOH going to enforce all of these
new regulations?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are definitely working through that
now right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I think the first year will
really be focused on education and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get people understanding what the new
rules and regulations are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand that a lot of these people
have products that they've already
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased in anticipation for the next six
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be some type of grace period
there for stuff that's on the shelves now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I think we're going
to take best practices from Ag and Markets
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we learned in the medical
marijuana industry in terms of testing
[SPEAKER_02]: products, doing random sampling,
secret shopping, stuff like that to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of make sure that things are properly
labeled and manufactured.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: There have been a lot of comments about
the federal limits or compliance limits
[SPEAKER_13]: for THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Folks should know that the National Farm
Bureau Federation is lobbying Congress for
[SPEAKER_13]: a 1% total THC limit, as well as many of
the hemp industry groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are not a member of Hemp Industry
Association or other national hemp
[SPEAKER_13]: associations, now may be a good time to
consider joining some of those because
[SPEAKER_13]: they are involved in that advocacy.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a question, Chris, if folks are
only one year into their license,
[SPEAKER_13]: will they get a refund?
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a great question, Larry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, that's an application fee
that we had with this program,
[SPEAKER_17]: and we are not going to be in the position
to prorate those licenses.
[SPEAKER_13]: So question for Pat, will existing
research partner processors be
[SPEAKER_13]: grandfathered into the DOH program?
[SPEAKER_13]: What would be the transition for existing
license holders?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually started the outreach about
a month ago to kind of do a level set,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're working with Ag and Markets now
to kind of get a good snapshot of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: where everyone is in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand that COVID really threw a
wrench into a lot of people setting up
[SPEAKER_02]: their facilities and getting all their
extraction equipment ready and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our goal here at DOH is really to work
with all the research partners to help
[SPEAKER_02]: them transition as seamless as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone will have to apply under a new
license because it is a new program,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're hoping to really spell that out
and make it as easy as possible to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: shift over so people who are in operation
can continue and those who are still
[SPEAKER_02]: setting up will understand the new
requirements and can hit the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: running.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think there's a similar question
for folks who will need to transition from
[SPEAKER_13]: the state program to the federal program
when should they start?
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got just a little bit more than two
months now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I started filling out my application this
morning and looking at the FBI identity
[SPEAKER_13]: history summary check, there is a big
notice here on the website that if you
[SPEAKER_13]: submit that via mail, the current
processing time is 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is an online process that they say
will only take four to five days.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you are currently a grower and will
need a grower's license on November 1st,
[SPEAKER_13]: I would encourage you to get that
paperwork in quickly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Larry, if I can jump in here real quick on
that because I see those questions in the
[SPEAKER_17]: chat as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in conversations with USDA on how
best to do this.
[SPEAKER_17]: There could be a scenario where they hold
applications and then if they were holding
[SPEAKER_17]: them, in other words, if they got my
application today, they would take a look
[SPEAKER_17]: at it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They would determine whether it was
complete or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: If it was incomplete, they'd return it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They would then perhaps hold it until the
end of October, issue the registration.
[SPEAKER_17]: With a couple of other states that frankly
are bigger in hemp production than New
[SPEAKER_17]: York on the cusp of making similar
decisions that we made, they're thinking
[SPEAKER_17]: that they don't want to get backed up and
what they may do is to start accepting
[SPEAKER_17]: those applications, acting on them and
actually issuing the license document with
[SPEAKER_17]: a November 1st effective date.
[SPEAKER_17]: What I would ask is that folks allow us to
have a little bit more conversation with
[SPEAKER_17]: USDA and see how they want to handle this.
[SPEAKER_17]: As an administrator who faced the tidal
wave of 2017 and 2018, I still want to
[SPEAKER_17]: maintain a respectful and collegial
relationship with USDA, particularly since
[SPEAKER_17]: one of their key staff people worked for
me and I have a lot of respect for her
[SPEAKER_17]: personally as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let us work this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see the answers to these types of
questions as far as timing of applications
[SPEAKER_17]: taking particularly long.
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had even a week or so to work
through that and then get that information
[SPEAKER_17]: up on our website as well as being able to
distribute it through your lists,
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that would be super.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that at a recent national
conference, I was involved in Bill Hoffman
[SPEAKER_13]: who was running the USDA program,
I would say was conflicted because he
[SPEAKER_13]: wants to serve the interests of the
farmers but is bound by the rule-making
[SPEAKER_13]: process at USDA.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they will maintain that attitude of
keeping the interests of farmers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to say, despite our clear policy
differences here, Bill seems to be a very
[SPEAKER_17]: thoughtful person and I think really wants
to see this industry grow and I think he
[SPEAKER_17]: can be a strong advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I've compared his situation to
where we were in the state in 2017.
[SPEAKER_17]: 2015 and 2016 when we put our first reg in
place, which if you remember had the
[SPEAKER_17]: requirements for the security fences and
was going to cost everybody $50,000,
[SPEAKER_17]: $60,000 an acre to comply with.
[SPEAKER_17]: Give them some time to work through this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a couple of final notes here.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the regulations, there is an
application window to USDA.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would close on October 31st.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, get going on your application.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a comment here that the FBI check
did come back quickly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's if you do it online.
[SPEAKER_13]: Any final comments, Pat or Chris,
because we're going to wrap this up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that excited to keep the dialogue
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please email us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy to work together on this and
make the best program we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Larry, thanks for the opportunity today
and I appreciate the thoughtful questions
[SPEAKER_17]: from the participants as well as again,
how respectful everybody has been of our
[SPEAKER_17]: staff here in Albany as well as the folks
we've got at work in the field.
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much to you, Chris and to Pat,
as well as to our other panelists,
[SPEAKER_13]: John, Lindsay and Mary.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, when you have questions,
they're your first point of contact,
[SPEAKER_13]: Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're very knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been building the knowledge base
in New York state for three years now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to thank everyone for
joining us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hit about 270 attendees at the peak.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had pretty broad impact nationally as
well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank again, all of our speakers
and panelists and thank you for attending.
[SPEAKER_13]: We look forward to hopefully an in-person
or a hybrid in-person and online field day
[SPEAKER_13]: in 2021.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
