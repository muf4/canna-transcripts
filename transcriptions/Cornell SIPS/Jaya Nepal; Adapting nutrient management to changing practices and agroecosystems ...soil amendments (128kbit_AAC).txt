[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm basically going to talk about
what I've done so far and how I see myself
[SPEAKER_00]: develop as a soil scientist moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm going to be jumping around
different research projects that I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past, starting from my undergrad
through my master's and then my PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some postdoc work that I did with Ryan
Lab, and also I'll give a brief glimpse of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'll be doing in the coming year at
Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from Nepal, so it's a small
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from a valley which is one of the
biggest valleys in Asia, and rice is our
[SPEAKER_00]: staple crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from somewhere here, and this is me
and my brother while growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, lots of influence of agriculture
while growing up, and because it's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural country, it's hard to not
think about agriculture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Biotar, as Matt mentioned,
during my undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during my master's at the University
of Tokyo, I worked with calcined phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a local phosphate rock
fertilizer that we're developing in
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination with University of Tokyo,
Xercas, and also people in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my main master's project,
and we did some crop modeling with APSIM
[SPEAKER_00]: to simulate those data.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PhD project was mainly looking at
Biotar and carbon nanoparticles as soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments for coarse textured sandy
acidic soils in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at different
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a more of a side project during my
PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year, around one year at Ryan Lab,
I got to work with some of the soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, soil health data from the long-term
experiment that we're having, and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different cover crop systems,
the cool work that is happening with Ryan
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my current project, I'll be working
mainly on using anaerobic soil
[SPEAKER_00]: disinfestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of like a technique in
organic systems, an alternative to
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical fumigant to sort of restore or
improve the soil health of organic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be introducing that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to Nepal, where I'm from,
we have a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we call it the burning problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers, especially at the end of the
season, they burn a lot of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: residues as a way to prepare their field
for the next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this creates a massive issue
environmentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the NASA firm's map
during that time of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see a bunch of fire, kind of small
fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not real fires, but these
are farmers burning the residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the southern part of Nepal,
where a lot of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: rice-weed-based agriculture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this affects the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the haze pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beautiful mountains that people go
to see are not really visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big issue managing crop
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think when we were doing
undergrad, we were about five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were thinking about a project
how to address this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there was a saying in our
country that sometimes we need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution like the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came up with the burning solution
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to get some of the crop
residues and prepare different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar from these residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a locally kind of like developed
furnace that we use to prepare these
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a field study with garden pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that, again, different
feedstock of biochar that we use have
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of effect on the yield,
but also on how the soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability and cycling happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think we could say that
using biochar was a good alternative,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially compared to burning those
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, again, I told you I'll be
jumping from one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask questions later if you have
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in West Africa during my master's
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, like I mentioned, we are working
with a local phosphate rock fertilizer as
[SPEAKER_00]: an alternative to the chemical triple
superphosphate or single superphosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are doing field studies with
sorghum in four different regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: Burkina Faso, a country in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found essentially was that it
was, again, on average about 30 to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: percent effective compared to the chemical
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really depended a lot on the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the factor that was driving that
difference across the region was the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil moisture and also the soil type
had a major impact on how effective these
[SPEAKER_00]: new phosphate rock fertilizers were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a bit of a crop modeling with
EPSIM.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to predict or stimulate the
biomass quite well, but we were still
[SPEAKER_00]: working on how to work or how to
accurately predict yield with EPSIM
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was not really sensitive to
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that has been added,
I think, since in EPSIM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot more robust in terms of
simulating these systems, EPSIM,
[SPEAKER_00]: as compared to this was 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my PhD was at the University of
Florida, where I worked with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: nanoparticles and biota and soil
amendments for the acidic sandy soils that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the big question, I guess,
that most of us in this room are working
[SPEAKER_00]: towards, I believe, is how can we grow
more food and how to grow it economically
[SPEAKER_00]: and also sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the idea behind this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there are different ways,
different management practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that we are all working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the ways that we can increase
our overall food production could be if we
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to utilize our sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there is only about 4% to 5% of
sandy soils in the world that are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we can figure out how to
cultivate them, there's a room for expense
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can imagine, there's a reason
why these soils are not cultivated as much
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not really easy to manage,
especially the soils that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: sandy, like those in Florida, more than
90% sands and those that are acidic pH in
[SPEAKER_00]: the range of 4.5 to 5, 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really difficult to build organic
matter in these conditions because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, temperature, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not easy to retain organic matter and
nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't help that these regions that
have a lot of sandy soils often also are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area that are quite vulnerable to
climate, if we can still say climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and all these kind of
pollution that makes it really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, though, I think these soils
have been managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite successfully, thanks to the citrus
industry that was quite successful in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since 2010, more than a decade now,
there's been a steady decline and the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is really suffering from the
citrus screening disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of need among farmers,
among different stakeholders to find
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative crops to citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, we are trying to see
if we can amend these soils to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with ways we can grow field crops in that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at different soil amendments,
compost, manure, biochar, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties, compost and manure,
more readily available nutrients versus
[SPEAKER_00]: more recalcitrant carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different challenges associated with
each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we were thinking about an idea,
we also learned about this new technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: new term, I guess, called nanotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was driven by the United States
Nanotechnology Initiative that was
[SPEAKER_00]: released in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a bunch of different
nanoparticles that were being researched
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we found that carbon
nanoparticle could be one way of
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing these soils and amending to
provide more carbon so the nutrient can be
[SPEAKER_00]: retained much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to investigate on this
product and we did some preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, my PhD work focused on
comparing biochar and carbon nanoparticles
[SPEAKER_00]: for how they affect nutrient retention,
how they affect crops, crop growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, and also if and how we can
optimize these systems in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obvious question, what are nanoparticles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, any particle that are in the
range of a billionth of a meter is known
[SPEAKER_00]: as nanoparticles for people working in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fine clay particles are also natural
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, of course, talking about the
engineered nanoparticles here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just to give a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, basically something that is
available in nature but also can be
[SPEAKER_00]: generated through industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon is a big component of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know a lot of different soil
functioning, especially nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way of kind of like understanding
these carbon nanoparticles could be to
[SPEAKER_00]: think it as ultrafine biochar,
not that straightforward, but just for
[SPEAKER_00]: visualizing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different kinds of
nanoparticles, mainly based on shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: solubility and all these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have heard about single wall,
the multi-wall nanotubes, bucky balls,
[SPEAKER_00]: all different kinds of nanoparticle that
are used in different industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the carbon black
nanoparticles, so this was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the byproduct of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to make it water-dispersible
so it can be applied through the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation and fertigation systems by the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind using these
nanoparticles is because when you convert
[SPEAKER_00]: these particles into such a small size,
they gain high Zeta potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: a negative charge potential, a high
surface area, of course, with the size,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have been shown to have some kind
of bio-stimulating effect to crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still new and not a lot of
studies have been done across different
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, so we wanted to see how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the soils we have down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a perspective that it's not
only about the size, when you reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: particle size to such small dimension,
the property of the particle also changes
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly, so it's not only the size
of the surface area effect, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: properties also change, and that could
impact different properties to plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the soil, so that's why we wanted
to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that didn't come out as I wanted,
but so my project had three components,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, soil, and environment,
so we were looking at how plants uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: and respond to these particles,
how does soil respond, how does nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling is affected, and how does it
affect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a bunch of incubation and
greenhouse studies in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: some column leaching studies, to see how
it leads to the environment and how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it can stay in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our initial idea, even though we
couldn't do during my time, but the people
[SPEAKER_00]: at UCF are now doing that life cycle
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at some soil ecology,
especially how it affects soil microbiome,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, and then we took these particles
into the field for some field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of greenhouse studies,
basically we found that the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: these particles was dependent on the
application rate, as we could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that around 200 to 400 ppm,
or milligram per kg application,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a spike in terms of both plants
on how well they were growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in the soil in terms of how much
nutrients was being retained.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also noticed that as we increased
these application rates to higher rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect seized quite dramatically at
some times, and even in soil, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil microbiome and biological
indicators started to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of saw that kind of response
through our greenhouse studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did some column leaching
studies in two different soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: alphasol and spotosol, basically differing
in peds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say spotosol was much more acidic
around peds five versus alphasol peds
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also wanted to kind of see across
both peds because these particles have low
[SPEAKER_00]: peds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we looked at different nutrients
and how they were being leased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bars that are kind of red,
yellow, and orange, I guess, are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like high-input systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were highly fertilized versus
these, they were low-input systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that in general, the carbon
nanoparticles, we used two different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we ran about 13 leaching events,
accumulating about two years of rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that 200 to 400 milligram per
kg of these carbon nanoparticles were
[SPEAKER_00]: retaining a lot more nutrients in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cumulative leaching of nitrate from
the soil, especially in those intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, were reduced significantly
throughout our leaching events.
[SPEAKER_00]: A similar effect in terms of phosphorus,
but mainly especially we saw significant
[SPEAKER_00]: effect in the potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine, potassium is a
positively charged ion in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we apply these particles with a
high negative potential, so we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were attracting the potassium ion a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we didn't kind of nail
down this, but we also thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this potassium, we also saw
some bio-stimulating effect on the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: was mainly driven through this potassium
uptake with these nanoparticles,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we couldn't kind of,
mechanistically prove that throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: study, but recent studies have also kind
of indicated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at soil ecology, mainly focused
on bacteria here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that when we applied these
nanoparticles, there were a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: unique genera of bacteria that we were
seeing in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that alone doesn't tell anything
that could be that there are new bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: coming because there's a new particle,
or it could be that it's just enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work is still a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we also looked at different
phylum of bacteria that were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that both biochar and also
low application rates of these
[SPEAKER_00]: nanoparticles were significantly
increasing the cyanobacteria in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are kind of responsible or related
to nitrogen fixation and also nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't done the functional stuff
yet, but that's something we're planning
[SPEAKER_00]: to do hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we did a bunch of greenhouse
column leaching and soil ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were finally kind of confident
enough to try these in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the research field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I could have given this a little bit
earlier, but a bit more about these
[SPEAKER_00]: nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are generated from carbon black.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have carboxyl functional group,
and they have pH in the range of 5.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: high and negative zeta potential,
and a particle size in the range of 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 130 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to biochar, so these were
generated from the oak wood residue that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more carbon and much more higher pH
compared to these nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a field study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a rotation, so two nearby
fields with sugar beet and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the only main difference in
terms of soil in these two experiments was
[SPEAKER_00]: we lined the beet field before study
because a beet was a lot more sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: low pH, but also we wanted to see the
effect of these materials in different pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of like, and the corn was
not lined before the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the eels, we saw that,
again, similar to what we saw before,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw significant increase in leaf soot
biomass and also root biomass here in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of sugar beet with around 200 to 400
ppm application of these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly about 20 to 24 percent increase
in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we didn't go as high this time,
but we could see that the increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: yield was starting to seize as we
increased the application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: With biochar, we didn't have a significant
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly in corn, we also saw that
there was a spike in terms of corn eels
[SPEAKER_00]: with these nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw yield responses up to about 400
milligram per kg for corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting quite good eels of corn
with these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think starting last year,
we had our first on-farm experiment with
[SPEAKER_00]: these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hearing that the farmers are quite
excited about these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't do that during my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, obvious questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's driving these eel gains with
nanoparticles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, soil biogeochemistry,
especially how the nutrients react to
[SPEAKER_00]: these particles and how these particles
are increasing the nutrient retention in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also saw that through our field
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And EC, so different dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled the soils 30, 70, and 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different treatments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue one here is what we're
comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the standard practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black one here is biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these four are the carbon nanoparticle
treatments with increasing rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that both carbon nanoparticles
and biochar rate soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in these soils, both in limed and
unlimed conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reduced soil EC, electrical
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it increased the buffering
capacity of these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of this, we saw that
nutrient retention was a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: increased with nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there was some increase,
we didn't see as significant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially during mid-season,
we found there was a lot more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: with these nanoparticle treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't present that here,
but when we look, we analyzed the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: of these corn and wheat plants,
we saw a significant spike of nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-season treatment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was throughout our greenhouse and
field studies and different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we saw a significant effect in
mid-season potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, and it was really almost
linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could really see that potassium was
retained in soil and it was being also
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaken by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we didn't look this directly,
but we also saw an increase in potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we looked at our leaf samples,
we didn't see a similar increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we don't know for sure yet,
but I think both the particles were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of able to retain more nutrients,
but carbon nanoparticle was able to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients to the plant more readily,
as opposed to biochar, which was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: holding more nutrients, but the supply was
not as similar to the nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that could be also because biochar
kind of requires more incubation time
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to nanoparticles because it's a
much larger surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar case, we looked at the microbial
respiration biomass, all the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a spike at low application rates
throughout the treatments and as we
[SPEAKER_00]: increase our application rates,
we could see that these microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators consistently were being reduced
at higher application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be because of a potential
hermetic effect, which basically means
[SPEAKER_00]: that at low application, there's a
positive effect and that either ceases or
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to have some kind of negative
effect at high application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty similar in case of the enzyme
activities, although it was significant
[SPEAKER_00]: only for the urease enzyme, which is
responsible for nitrogen, but we also saw
[SPEAKER_00]: a decline as we increased the rate in
terms of the enzymatic activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, we found that carbon
nanoparticles increased both corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar beet yields in the field,
both enhanced the buffering capacity of
[SPEAKER_00]: our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon nanoparticles especially,
both particles also increased the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: retention, but carbon nanoparticles
increased the leaf uptake of NPK and we
[SPEAKER_00]: found that at higher application rates,
the microbial activity was seized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at lower activities, there was an
increase in soil microbial activities and
[SPEAKER_00]: we also did some ecological analysis here
and we found pretty similar results
[SPEAKER_00]: compared like the field studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it for my PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined Ryan Lab last year, 2024,
and I was involved in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, different cover crops based
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little about the
organic cropping systems experiment that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have and this is the 20th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially we have four different
treatments here or four different
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophies of how we can manage organic
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: High fertility systems, here we are
increasing the the amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer that we are applying to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot higher, about 50% higher
fertilizer than the low fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the low fertility, we are relying a lot
more on the ecological processes such as
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating legumes to provide that sort
of deficient soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two gradients of fertility and two
gradients of weed management, enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: weed management, here we have more
intensive weed management, multiple passes
[SPEAKER_00]: to control weeds versus a reduced tillage
treatment or philosophy where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the tillage and trying to manage
weed more culturally such as using a mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crops were grown in rotation,
different crops, there are two entry
[SPEAKER_00]: points, it's a little bit complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go through all of these, but what I
was looking mainly was we're comparing how
[SPEAKER_00]: these four treatments line up in terms of
soil health indicators and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing these two conventional corn
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was 80 years, around 80 years of
conventional corn and then this treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: right here is the alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the grass alleys in between the
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly looking at the conventional corn
versus the four different treatments and
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see that compared to the
conventional corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw a significant effect in terms of
soil aggregate stability with the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letters are slightly off here,
but irrespective of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophies or treatment that we're
using, we could see an increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregation and soil structure throughout
these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as clear differences in terms of
predictable soil protein and also soil
[SPEAKER_00]: labile soil carbon, the permanent
manganate oxidizable soil carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but overall, when we looked at the overall
soil health score, this is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Comprehensive Soil Health
Assessment, we saw that compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: corn and even compared to the alley,
the organic systems were consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrespective of the philosophies,
higher soil health indicators in these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of the main thing that I
looked at from this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project that I was involved in was
using the integrated cover crop experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: to control a white mold, which is a
soybean disease, and also weeds in soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry bean systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we're doing is we're
planting the cover crop in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: September, October cereal rye,
and we had three different treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: here, two till treatments, one without
cover crop, one with cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one treatment that has where the cover
crop is mowed and a mat of cereal rye is
[SPEAKER_00]: formed for weed, and also we found that it
was effective in disease suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two main crops, soybean and dry bean,
different seeding rates, and we evaluated
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant parameters and analyzed
these in R.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mainly going to focus on white mold,
because that was kind of like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct results that we saw from the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the three treatments,
the till is only without cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop till treatment, and cover crop
mulch treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that compared to both the till
treatments, the treatment with the rye
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch was able to reduce the white mold by
almost 70 to 80% across soybean and in
[SPEAKER_00]: both ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is happening here is this is the
pathogen of white mold, so what this is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is by having the mulch protect the
soil or cover the soil, we are reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the functional germination of these
apothecia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in the rye mulch treatment
versus this is the till treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is why, because of the reduction
in the spores produced, we were seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in white mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of weed biomass and density,
we saw an overall reduction in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass with the rye mulch treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some variation across ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here this is the weed density,
so we think that some of these high
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers is because there was a regrowth in
seasonal rye, which was also counted as
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, and because there is not really big
difference in biomass, so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like counting more small plants,
but not really turning into a big biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: that is competing in terms of weed
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a variation across ears,
so in 2020, the yield were pretty similar
[SPEAKER_00]: among the treatments versus in 2019,
in soybean, we had about 20% yield
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction, and in dry bean, there was
about 20% yield reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depending on probably weather
and also there could be room for
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing planting rates in dry beans,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it from my post-doc with
Brian Lab, and now I'm in my second
[SPEAKER_00]: post-structural adventure with the
Vegetable Crop Science Lab at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, kind of switching gears into more
vegetables and horticultural crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main project that I'll be working at
Penn State is sort of regenerating or
[SPEAKER_00]: improving the soil health through
anaerobic soil desinfestation to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, weeds, and soil health in organic
vegetable production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be the main project
that I'll be working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a bunch of different greenhouse
and field studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, what we're doing is
amending the soil with readily
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposable carbon source, and then
mulching the soil with, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the soil with oxygen impermeable
film to induce the anaerobic condition in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, and then we are irrigating the
soil until saturation and leaving it for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then opening the film and then going
with a vegetable crop, tomato or cucumber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to see effect in soil health and also
crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, another thing that we are trying
to kind of like add to this from this year
[SPEAKER_00]: is to try to use more locally available
carbon sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at molasses, which is a
by-product of sugarcane industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat midlings, which are a by-product
from wheat, and also poultry manure or
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using them as carbon and nitrogen
source to optimize the anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also trying to integrate
different cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at triticale,
I think, and crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: To induce, to provide the source of carbon
to induce anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, this is a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, again, bunch of different
research, one direction to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think what is pretty clear
is that management, how we manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: soils is really key to how the soil
fertility is affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But weather environment also has a big
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we are trying to model our
systems or amendments, it is critical that
[SPEAKER_00]: we take weather into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one single practice or system
that can be adopted for one reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can say that is universally
successful or this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, sometimes it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one practice, sometimes you have to
combine different things to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, each system respond differently
based on practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big challenge, I guess, I talk a lot
about soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big challenge, again, is how do we
provide these amendments to the farmers is
[SPEAKER_00]: always a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether we talk about biochar or
nanoparticles, to scale up, to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make it applicable in the large field
context remains a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in this, we might need more
help from the industry or collaborate with
[SPEAKER_00]: different stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, moving forward, where I see
myself going forward in terms of my ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: based on my experience, continue the soil
fertility research, trying new amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: different management practices,
but also look at the soil health together
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil fertility is going to be
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I am really interested in
looking at it from a system point of view
[SPEAKER_00]: and work towards building a system rather
than only one management practice or one
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, different ecosystems, different
amendments or different practices respond
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some systems, biochar seems to perform
much better compared to even cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: while in other systems, cover crops
perform a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to provide a context, even though
biochar was not like really stand out in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my studies, but there are some
studies that show that biochar can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase soil organic carbon much better
than even cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the management, whether again
in the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using ecological principles to look at
soil fertility, soil health, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at ways we can prevent losses,
reducing erosion and also minimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I guess, sort of thinking
soil health, putting the soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: concept in this whole one health concept,
because we also work with different
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, a lot of diseases, and I'm going
to work with diseases in my current
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to combine plant disease,
soil disease, everything into this one
[SPEAKER_00]: health concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something I'm thinking more and
more these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, with that, I would like to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of interesting data.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was curious about two things,
actually there were many, but you said
[SPEAKER_07]: that the carbon nanomaterials were
negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they come so out of the box?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you choose them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm familiar that a lot of carbon
nanomaterials are not charged at all,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they shouldn't be if they're just
graphene sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no charge on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or did you oxidize them in some way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these were oxidized to have the
carboxyl groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the charge is coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you used what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Peroxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was oxidized to have that
carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the charge is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I follow up on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was excited to see that especially the
carbon nanomaterials didn't have really a
[SPEAKER_07]: high pH.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have been disappointed,
but I'm excited because that excludes sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of pH correction from the possible
effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can really focus on maybe nutrient
retention.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I saw that your soil pH did
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had 5.5, the soil had 5 to 6.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why did the pH change in the soil when
you added something that had basically the
[SPEAKER_07]: same pH as the soil was?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is something that made us
curious as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this study in bunch of
different pH soils to see if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were seeing this effect much more in
more really acidic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those alpha soil, the increase in
pH with these nanoparticles was not as
[SPEAKER_00]: much even though there was some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we couldn't really pinpoint where
this increase is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just another question on the carbon
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it sound like it's very positive
across the board, especially in coarse
[SPEAKER_06]: textured soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are kind of the challenges and
limitations of using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think because we're seeing kind of
like a decline or negative impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the soil microbial aspect at
the higher doses, I think whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they accumulate in the soil for longer
time is going to be challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you kind of like keep applying
nanoparticles for again and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's why I think having
that life cycle assessment is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happening currently at UCF,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see that being something that
could be a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of like seeing the effect,
we could see it throughout our study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of the comparison of the biochar
versus the nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one of the graphs that you showed,
you saw this for looking at EC,
[SPEAKER_03]: you showed that the biochar had a dramatic
effect on EC, lowering it much more than
[SPEAKER_03]: the nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet you had much higher levels when
you were rinsed them off with malelec or
[SPEAKER_03]: however you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was going on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, did you have different CECs?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, clearly you had a measurement of
what their charge was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a measurement of their total
charge per volume?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't measure that total charge
per volume, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the CEC sort of base saturation
component was not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this could have been the effect of just
nutrient efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be fertilizer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You told me the carbon particle increased
the corn yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a very useful information for
the corn production systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering which parameters,
yield parameters, could be increased for
[SPEAKER_02]: number of cobs or grain kernel numbers per
cobs or kernel weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we did that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think overall, we saw the sizes of
the kernel was the thing that was most
[SPEAKER_00]: increased across the treatments,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have that data somewhere,
so I can check that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a basic topical question.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you started the presentation,
you mentioned about the burning problem
[SPEAKER_04]: and the emissions of burning all this rice
residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does the production of biochar
compare in terms of emissions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it lower emissions and improve air
quality to the ovens that you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, one thing it does directly
is that if you burn something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, you affect the soil also,
soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes directly into environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to biochar, it's much more
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a controlled burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of comparing the exact
numbers, I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basic question.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black, the source of the black carbon,
what is that in terms of resourcing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is basically, in a layman kind of
term, it is something that remains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial kiln.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you burn something with carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if you burn a crop
residue, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically how the Volbes company is the
one who is processing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of like sourcing those
carbon black that gets stuck to those
[SPEAKER_00]: kilns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using that to oxidize it to
make these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of like the cheapest way
to produce these.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're burning the other material.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they doing with the other
material that's not stuck to the kiln?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably used for other things
that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to figure out what the source
situation is and how that applies to get,
[SPEAKER_05]: then it sounds like the more minimal
amount of material that's being used for
[SPEAKER_05]: this other process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quantifying it to go to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're doing some like cost
analysis also to see if it stacks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I mentioned the scrapping
of the kiln thing, because that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that looked kind of like
economical in terms of what we can use as
[SPEAKER_00]: a source longer term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, where exactly they get that
carbon black particle from, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're working with this company
and they were, yeah, they were giving us
[SPEAKER_00]: these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to scale it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can maybe ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like from a sustainability perspective,
I think that would be an important to know
[SPEAKER_05]: what the other things are going on in the
resource that they gave you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I bring it back to the Nanopark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nutrients that you were, so you're
having, you have negative decharged.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the responses that were associated with
the nitrate versus the ammonium,
[SPEAKER_03]: what difference is, I didn't see it quick
enough that kind of responses were you
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing that were different there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was interesting, but we were
seeing a lot more nitrate than ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expecting more ammonium to be
retained because of the positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative stars, but we are seeing a lot
more nitrate compared to ammonium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that more like, was it associated with
the moisture component of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we think because of the
humidity and yeah, the moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you measure water holding capacity
with the amendments versus non-amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't do that.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's one thing we also noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially with the biochar
treatments that it seemed like the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and those components were a lot
better with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't measure those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are no other questions,
let's thank Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
