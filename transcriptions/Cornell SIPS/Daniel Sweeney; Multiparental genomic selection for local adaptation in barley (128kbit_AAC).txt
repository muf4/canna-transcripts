[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to be talking about
malting barley today, which is barley
[SPEAKER_00]: that's used to make beer and whiskey,
which makes for some fun phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so as many of you know, there's a lot
of craft brewing that goes on in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much so that we're the fifth largest
producer of beer in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that growth has been spurred by
the Farm Brewery Bill, which is passed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state government in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives economic incentives to local
brewers to use local ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients being malts and hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, these farm brewers have to
use 20% of their ingredients being from
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, by 2019, that's going to bump up
to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, we're not growing a
whole lot of barley in New York right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creeping up, but we have some
progress to make so we can meet that 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum by 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the small grains group has been
trialing malting barley and starting some
[SPEAKER_00]: research since about 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for many reasons, which I'll go into,
we decided to actually start some breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: research, which we're calling the Born,
Bred, and Brewed in New York Project,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I will hereafter refer to as the
BBB.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so our main goals here are to actually
breed barley that's adapted to the unique
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions of New York, understand how
genotype, environment, and G by E
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions affect malt quality across
the state, establish best management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for New York growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is a very new crop in New York,
we still don't really know what the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to grow barley is, and then variety
trialing and recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work focuses on these first two points,
which I'll be covering today.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so before I continue, I wanted to give
a brief overview of the malting and
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing process for those who aren't
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any crop, it starts with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working in spring barley, so we plant
this in mid to end of April and harvest in
[SPEAKER_00]: early August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of my nursery this
summer at the Helfer Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need clean, plump, disease-free
grain to malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malting is three steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You steep the grain so it imbibes water
and can germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination is the second process,
and then you dry it and kill it heat to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop enzymes, color, and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is germinating barley right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little rootlets are called chit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an almost finished malt
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the dried rootlets right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have the malt, you go on to
the brewing process, which starts with
[SPEAKER_00]: grinding the malt, steeping it in water to
remove the sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you a kind of a malt soup,
which is called wort.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wort here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add hops to the wort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You boil it to extract hop compounds and
sterilize it, cool it, add yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fermentation commences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after fermentation, you sometimes
filter it, let it rest for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you bottle it so you can enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that there are some
challenges for growing barley in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly because of the weather we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this map, this graphic is from the
USDA, harvested barley acreage in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, New York is producing so
much barley that they didn't even survey
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is being grown in the upper
grade plains in the Mountain West,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have warm days, cool nights,
and low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low humidity means low disease,
and it also means that it will not
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-harvest the sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what happens when the grain has
low dormancy, gets wet before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grain starts the germination
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bad because it means the barley
does not malt very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This malting is germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other big problem we have in humid
areas is Fusarium head blight,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fungal pathogen that affects
the developing spike and produces a nasty
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxin called deoxynidonol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even up here in middle of nowhere,
Montana, malting barley is a tricky crop
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traits that we're really interested
in and that are going to be key to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting malting barley to work in
New York are disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-harvest sprouting resistance,
and good enough malt quality that craft
[SPEAKER_00]: malters and brewers actually want to use
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of our germplasm is actually from
this area, because this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs are, and then also
Western Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a very large amount of barley
up there, but also European varieties from
[SPEAKER_00]: France and Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany grows a lot of barley,
and if they can grow malting barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we can, too, in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the method that we're using to
actually go about achieving this goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-parental genomic selection in a
reduced nested association mapping panel
[SPEAKER_00]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about that next couple
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been a lot of genomic
prediction studies within bi-parental
[SPEAKER_00]: families, and you can get pretty good
prediction accuracies within bi-parental
[SPEAKER_00]: families for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are not that many in
connected bi-parental families.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two examples from Albrecht
Melkinger's group in Germany, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: are both of May's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from these publications, there is some
promise that combining half-sib families
[SPEAKER_00]: can give you better prediction accuracies
than just single bi-parental families.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a useful breeding model for
us, because there's one variety called the
[SPEAKER_00]: AC synergy that we really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Western Canada, but its biggest
problem is that it sprouts like crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't rain in Canada up
there, and they don't need spark
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really just want to improve one
trait, maybe two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, crossing the single parent to
seven other parents, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us a reasonable breeding strategy,
as well as academically interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last year and a half to two years,
I've been developing the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about 1,400 two-row spring barley
lines from seven full-sib families,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, are connected by a single
common female parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two locations this year,
and since I didn't have that much seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to grow it in head rows in augmented
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head rows are okay here, because I'm not
interested in yield right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more interested in quality traits and
disease, which I can phenotype in head
[SPEAKER_00]: rows just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of phenotyping this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually still doing some phenotyping
in the lab, and we harvested a subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: this to send to New Zealand for a winter
nursery seed increase, so we can grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these and replicate the yield trials
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if I'll get to go there,
but maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I actually don't have genotypic data
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's taken a little longer than
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually just got the last two files back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This morning, so if I were presenting in
two weeks, I would have had some
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting genomic things to talk about,
but you're stuck with phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: information, which is still kind of
interesting, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because this is an augmented design,
oops, sorry, the entries are random,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can calculate bluffs and the nested
within check.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heritabilities are kind of interesting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that means I did all of the
families at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all 1,342 lines, and these are
heritabilities within each of my seven
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see there's quite a range across
each of the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Height, heading date, leaf rust,
spot blush, pre-harvest sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably, and then the genetic
variants over here, there's quite a range,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for height, and then standard
traits, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more interesting things you
might know is that this SN family here
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to have lower heritabilities and
lower genetic variants compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other families.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This parent is called Newdale,
and it's one of the parents' synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't realize this until after the
fact, but it was a happy accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made for some interesting experimental
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will not be being advanced in the
breeding lines, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then I fit these with AR1,
AR1 row column for variant structures in
[SPEAKER_00]: astromal art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spatial effects did improve the
model, so I kept them in, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't noticeable spatial variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so again, I haven't actually done
any prediction yet, but I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting things that I can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just start with our BLOP and probably
Bayes CPI models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm expecting for some of these
traits, there to be some major QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: segregating, major effect QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most obvious, I can start to show
up real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within family predictions, across family
predictions, whole set to whole set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a population from the
University of Minnesota, two-row spring
[SPEAKER_00]: barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's genotyped and phenotyped,
so that's unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can do various combinations of all
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of work ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was hoping to present on some of
this today, but come back next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there'll be some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have kind of a mini experiment
within the genomic selection experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: going at early selection versus random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in looking at spatial
correction versus just raw data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the population structure
design, I should be able to run GWAS for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if I have any major effect QTL
that can fit as fixed effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the size here, I can
empirically look at optimal size for the
[SPEAKER_00]: training set and how many markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I need to speed through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually gonna be doing selection
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be removing two families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossing between all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypic and genomic selection,
advancing simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot out there in actually
using selection indices for genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Elliot Hefner paper from back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just looked at it from a prediction
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't actually do any selections
with selection index.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're actually trying to do
some reading here, and I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, I would like to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, I want to talk about another
project too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to malting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So malt quality is a super important
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made up of eight to 10 quantitative
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's loads of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really expensive, takes a lot of
grain, usually in later generations like
[SPEAKER_00]: any quality trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are micro malting machines,
but they're also expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to make my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a crappy cartoon showing a
hydroponic ebb and flow table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water moves up into this top tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley grain is suspended in mesh bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm calling it nano malting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can fit a whole lot in this three by
three table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steeping takes place in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination takes place in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all in a growth chamber to
keep relative humidity and temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done a couple of test runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are my mesh bags here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the size here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm killing these in a food dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes I'm interested in looking
at are grain protein, malt beta-glucan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and malt extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some nice regional trial grain
samples from the past three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and spring barley, multiple
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a little G by E malt study,
which will be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick acknowledgments, thank my committee,
Mark, Gary, and Jessica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the Sorals Lab, particularly
James for lab and greenhouse help,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Venture, Amy Fox, and Jesse Chavez
for field help.
[SPEAKER_00]: David, especially, for doing all the
disease inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Cummings in the Bergstrom lab for
making an inoculum, particularly the
[SPEAKER_00]: bipolaris, which is a big amount of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very grateful to her in the Bergstrom
lab for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alyssa Blachez for pathology questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie Hansen for letting me use the Vines
lab NIR machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Casmar for letting me use his ebb and
flow table, which I will get back at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point, is alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Erin McLeod from Hartwood College
who runs the Kraft Food and Beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: Center and is a malting science wizard and
has helped us out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, think NY, drink NY, and I'll be
happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we've tested some UK spring wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they might actually grow a little
bit more winter grain because their
[SPEAKER_00]: winters are not nearly as harsh as they
are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the UK material, somewhat
surprisingly, has not done well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We by far have the best luck in European
germplasm with French and German
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many French and German
private companies that are actively
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in spring barley breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Finnish, too, but that's a pretty
different environment from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're mostly focusing on like KWS,
Cicobra, Syngenta, Brine material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is hybrid barley in Europe,
but it's primarily for feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the name, but it's looked at
hybrid barley for malting quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you'd probably run into the
same problem that hybrid rice has,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it might yield like crazy,
but people don't like the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And malting barley is the breeding
programs are fully dictated by what the
[SPEAKER_00]: brewers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, the North American
Tiro barley germplasm base is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow because selection for the malting
quality parameters for industrial brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: is so precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be something interesting to look
into, but I'm not aware of any hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: malting varieties that are being
researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I should be able to compare it to micro
malts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit of using those regional
trials is that we send one rep of one
[SPEAKER_00]: location to the USDA Small Grains Quality
Lab in Madison, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also send some samples to Aaron
McLeod.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a micro malter, and I need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not gonna be confident that
I'm doing it right unless I have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, so that one back cross that I
talked about, that's also, they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to what they call the Canadian
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canadian quality means that it yields
well and it sprouts when you spit on it
[SPEAKER_00]: because the big Canadian maltsters wanna
be fast and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was a little too simplistic in
saying there's one trait we wanna improve
[SPEAKER_00]: upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could improve some disease resistance
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears that the pre-harvest
sprouting from the past QTL mapping papers
[SPEAKER_00]: in barley is oligogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the heritabilities I'm seeing
and my phenotypic distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's probably gonna be
oligogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping to have some success in
getting good prediction accuracies and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually selecting for pre-harvest
sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want it as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a skill level difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have guys that have been brewing in
their basement for the last five years and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to start selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have people that are
professionally trained in the dunes for 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a skill level difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that raw materials are
probably pretty similar at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have access to the same malts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be buying New York malts if
they wanted to, or they could be buying it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a large scale maltster in Oregon or
Washington or Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can actually make a big difference
in the taste of the beer and the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are water differences across
the state, that could potentially be part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it's actually skill and the
way you market it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of different beer
styles that I could give a whole nother 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minute seminar on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I could do that for a grass group
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to know about beer,
I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, let's thank Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
