[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Lucia Vignale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm organizing the Animal Hemp webinar
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a third year PhD candidate in the
Larry Smart Lab at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm working on Hemp Fowler and Moldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's presenter is Professor and Athlete
Trottier from the Department of Animal
[SPEAKER_00]: Science at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She previously spent 25 years at Michigan
State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where she's now Professor Emerita.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, she teaches courses on

[SPEAKER_00]: and directs the Master of Professional
Studies program in Animal Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research focuses on amino acid
metabolism, nutrient efficiency in pigs
[SPEAKER_00]: and horses, and most recently an interest
in the pharmacokinetics of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nutritional application of hemp
seed meal in horse and swine diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a quick reminder before we start,
as we've been doing this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: please use the chat for greetings and
other communications and submit your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for Natalie using the Q&A
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talk would last approximately 40
minutes and we'll follow it with a Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll thank Natalie at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a reminder that we are recording the
webinar and we are going to later upload
[SPEAKER_00]: it to our School of Integrative Plant
Sciences YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, Natalie, please take the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Lucia, for the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to share my slides here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so welcome again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to the Cornell University
Hemp webinar series for hosting this
[SPEAKER_01]: session.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'll be discussing the
nutritional opportunities presented by
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seed meal, particularly in the diets
of horses and sows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what I'll cover today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentation is split into two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first half, I'll be reviewing the
digestive strategies of horses and pigs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the structural carbohydrate needs,
in particular, the neutral detergent fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: or MDF, and the scenarios when concentrate
feeds are used for horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also look at the unique feeding
behavior of gestating sows and the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: body of evidence that support fiber
enrichments in their diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how we can see really a place for
hemp seed meal, in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: in pregnant sows and, of course,
horses at all stage of their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second half of this presentation
basically will focus specifically on hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: seed meal, its protein quality,
the basically how can it be sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: how it is that it potentially be the
perfect ingredient for horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just presenting some of the very,
very few findings that we have out there
[SPEAKER_01]: for horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically we can really make a good
case study for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, hope for sows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be using a little bit of data out
there from pigs, growing pigs and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can extrapolate that to sows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's difficult for me to really steer
away from nutrition and physiology
[SPEAKER_01]: completely when I give a talk because
that's my expertise, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what I'd like to do here is
make the case that pigs and horses,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, are relying on fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horses being an obligate herbivore must
have fibers in their diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just here a little bit of
taxonomy briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose you or bore you to
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them, some of you might find
this also interesting is that here we have
[SPEAKER_01]: ruminants, bovidae, servidae, and we have
our pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those families belong to the order
Arteodactyla.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the right we have horses,
rhinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, these belong to the Perisodactyla
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, besides the fact that those
two different orders are separated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that here we have uneven toes and
here we have even toes, suidae,
[SPEAKER_01]: or pigs, differ from the rest of these
guys here in their digestive system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're looking at these guys
being mainly ruminants in terms of their
[SPEAKER_01]: digestive strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a complex stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do foregut fermentation and
rumination, except for hippos and pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pigs are really interesting because
they follow a digestive strategy somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to what we have in horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a simple stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a highly developed large
intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do quite a bit of hindgut
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore we're trying to,
especially in the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: really push more fibers in pig diets,
even in the little guys that just got a
[SPEAKER_01]: few weeks after weaning, as we have moving
away from antibiotics and realizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: fibers serve as probiotics and providing
those animals with potential additional
[SPEAKER_01]: gut immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of fun stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, what I'd like to do here is move
on and just contrast quickly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't get into nitty-gritty of cats
and dogs, but just to contrast that cats
[SPEAKER_01]: and dogs are very different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have simple stomachs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stomachs are large.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fermentation in the foregut,
of course, but in their large intestine,
[SPEAKER_01]: cats very limited and dogs moderate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more and more we're seeing actually
some fibers added in dog diets and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially hemp seed meal could find a
place in dog diets at some point,
[SPEAKER_01]: replacing in part some of the flax seed
meal that is actually really popular in
[SPEAKER_01]: dog food, but that's for another talk
later on potentially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, let's look at the digestive tract
capacity again to show you, convince you
[SPEAKER_01]: that hemp seed meal has a place in diet
for pigs, but certainly for horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here basically, this graph basically
emphasizes how much digestive capacity in
[SPEAKER_01]: horses is devoted to the large intestine
where fiber fermentation occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the cecum here, the stomach,
small intestine, cecum and colon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those together form the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cecum and the pig and the horse and the
dog, very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically the colon in the horse,
very large capacity followed by the pig
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not too much, but some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point being here is that the large
intestine in the horses consists of
[SPEAKER_01]: basically capacity wise, 65% of the entire
GI tract, which is amazing when you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pigs actually is 41%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite, it's quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite important nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have our dogs that where we're
thinking more and more that we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing fibers in their diet,
but definitely pigs, pregnant sows,
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, where we're showing more
and more evidence that we need to push the
[SPEAKER_01]: fibers in their diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horses, number one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We always start with forage in their diet
before anything else, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again here, so if we're looking at the
slides, when we consider forage quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and alignment with digestive physiology,
we look at NDF, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So NDF, low NDF diets, typically under 5%,
will provide a minimal fermentation
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically what you'd see in dog diets or
carnivore diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're moving on to diets
containing between 6 and 20% NDF,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the fibers that you find in the
plant cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the structural fibers, not the water
soluble fibers or the rapidly fermentable
[SPEAKER_01]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are structural fibers that we
find in the plant cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, basically moderate diets
provide some fermentable substrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really the high NDF diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those between 45 and 60%,
that best match the fermentation capacity
[SPEAKER_01]: of hindgut species like horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In pigs, fiber fermentation plays a lesser
role, but still very valuable role,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in sows where fiber is
increasingly being linked to long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity and improve gut health.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area is still developing,
lots of fun stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of interest in optimizing fiber
for pigs is really clearly growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, clearly, what is this picture
telling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides looking a little bit scary,
horses are obligate herbivores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do require this carbohydrates that
you find in the plant cell wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pigs, again, they would benefit
immensely, especially sows from a high
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on here, let's look more
specifically at the recommended fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: levels for horses, for example,
for optimal digestive health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horses should contain a minimum of 40% NDF
and ideally up to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these structural carbohydrates are
found in plant cell walls and they ferment
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly in the hindgut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this helps maintain a healthy
microbial population and it reduces the
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of digestive disturbances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I keep looking at hemp seed
meal as a really perfect feed for horses
[SPEAKER_01]: because of its very low starch and water
soluble carbohydrates, it's high fiber,
[SPEAKER_01]: very moderate fat content, but very
interesting and relatively high protein
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look here at what horses are fed,
number one, grasses and alfalfa as a
[SPEAKER_01]: legume.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking here and what we see is NDF
content of those forages, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, again, the plant cell wall
structural carbohydrates aligned with what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're recommending those horses to
receive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're looking at this slide here,
you wonder why I have this forest picture
[SPEAKER_01]: with a large hole in here and looking at
how much room it takes in the abdominal
[SPEAKER_01]: cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is no joke, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with why structural
carbohydrate matters is that
[SPEAKER_01]: non-structural carbohydrate, like the
starch and the water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates, like the fructans and the
simple sugars, for example, the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-alfalfa glucons, the oligopol,
the saccharides, the fructans,
[SPEAKER_01]: the simple sugars, these guys ferment
really rapidly in the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really want is we wanna have a
diet with carbohydrates that are slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentable, not rapidly fermentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly fermentable carbohydrates can help
stabilize the gut environment and our
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred energy source for high gut
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here as a practical note, grasses and
alfalfa, particularly when harvested at a
[SPEAKER_01]: more mature stage, because we want to
harvest forageable horses for volume
[SPEAKER_01]: usually, so they're gonna be closer to a
mature stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will naturally contain lower amount
of starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, you can see here, naturally
speaking, they're low in starch,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they will be lower in starch,
but lower in volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And water soluble carbohydrate,
when they are harvested closer to a mature
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, protein levels in grasses align,
especially at the lower protein
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, closer to grass maturity,
aligns exactly where the horse's protein
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement is actually at maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when to add a concentrate feed,
this is where hemp seed meal would be
[SPEAKER_01]: finding a home in horse feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while forage is the foundation of a
horse diet, there are cases where a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate feed also known as a ration
balancer is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's especially true for horses that are
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an increased energy and protein
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have forages that are higher
than 60% in DF, we're gonna want to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: ration balancer in there to meet the
energy and potentially the protein needs
[SPEAKER_01]: that might not be sufficient in just a
forage, it's just a hay diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that concentrate, we want our goal
is actually to provide energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mitigating starch content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to limit how much grain we can
use in those concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could we have an ingredient that is
actually providing quite a bit of fat,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Moderate amount of protein to potentially
replace entirely the soybean meal in those
[SPEAKER_01]: diets, replacing the flax seed,
which is also a very popular ingredient in
[SPEAKER_01]: horse diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have to aim for 50% MDF of the
total ration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we have a good potential
placeholder for hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a picture of a polo horse
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: These horses require a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, when to add a concentrate to
this Timothy hay, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have several grains and
by-products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we would like to see in here is a
great proportion of hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When to add a concentrate to common
scenario, again, is a working horse that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a limited access to a working horse or
scenarios where a horse has limited access
[SPEAKER_01]: to hay, just because of weather,
season, price, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of different reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we want to maybe provide
think about providing a concentrate is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be really high in fiber,
for example, or even a balanced diet,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pelleted or extruded feed that is
completely balanced or complete for a
[SPEAKER_01]: horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: An aging horse, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So aging horses cannot chew anymore on
their hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we start thinking about a
complete diet, a complete feed that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be pelleted or cubes for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we know horses need a long
stem, at some point they can't chew
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we need to find a form of NDF
packaged differently, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, when to add a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in terms of let's stop numbers
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general practice is that we want to
limit starch to two to four grams per
[SPEAKER_01]: kilogram body weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, we really want to restrict
that one gram per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at high risk horses and ponies that
tend to get fat and have metabolic
[SPEAKER_01]: syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, I'm just going to give you
an example here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a balancer that contains 45%
starch and the horse weighs 400 kilogram,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're limited to feeding this horse to
about 900 grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the concentrate contains 60% starch,
then you're limited to 700 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to try to lower the starch
content 20% in some of the projects that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did and to really provide a feed for
horses that are high risk or simply just
[SPEAKER_01]: need an additional set of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good practice is not to exceed
water-soluble carbohydrate, 12%,
[SPEAKER_01]: or make sure that the non-structural
carbohydrates that's inside of the cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant cell, is maximized at 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hemp seed mill profile is actually
really interesting because it meets all
[SPEAKER_01]: these requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about pigs before we dig into
more specifically about hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anatomically, the cells are hindgut
fermenters, growing pigs are, but cells
[SPEAKER_01]: have a very large hindgut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolutionary, they have adapted to
foraging a lifestyle, constantly eating
[SPEAKER_01]: diluted fibrous feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're naturally active, especially near
the end of gestation where they become
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperphagic, the elot, and they're
building nests for their piglets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this natural drive plays a key role in
how we should think about feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies for cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been thinking more and more
about this, but there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: room here to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in contrast to their evolutionary
feeding behavior, modern housing system
[SPEAKER_01]: often restrict these natural instants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cells in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada are commonly limit-fed with
relatively low fiber diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're relatively inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lack access to nesting behavior
combined with boredom and frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It results in stereotypic behaviors,
which are repetitive, purposeless action,
[SPEAKER_01]: often linked to poor welfare, let's admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, limit-fed, low fiber,
fiber is a little bit higher than it used
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, but still a lot of room,
less active, no access to express nesting
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is actually giving us
opportunities to think about increasing,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for alternative ingredients to
increase the feed or the fiber in those
[SPEAKER_01]: diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, in smaller swine operations,
we provide an opportunity for more space
[SPEAKER_01]: and enrichment, the use of fiber-rich
feeds to support both the welfare and the
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we are considering new ingredients
like hemp seed meal, its potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide bulk and nutrition to gestating
cells is undeniable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for cells, so what does the science
say?
[SPEAKER_01]: A typical corn-soy, for example,
corn DDGS contains about 14% NDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not enough for a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber inclusion, so we've seen that
studies have shown that fiber inclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: with soy hulls and wheat bran improves
society and reduces stereotypic behaviors
[SPEAKER_01]: in limit-fed cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are increasing NDF to around 18 to
20%, we have clear welfare benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reduce oral stereotypies, we improve
gut health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our current studies, it's still in
progress, we've been feeding 30% wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: bran during gestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show that it reduces constipation rate,
dystocia, which is difficult, firing or
[SPEAKER_01]: giving birth, and also reduces gestation
length, meaning that it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to intervene to induce
firing by day one, 14 or 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 15, because those cells have to be
timed for basically managing the units.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to have all those cells
farrow in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the 30% wheat bran, we didn't
have to intervene at all and give drugs to
[SPEAKER_01]: those cells to induce farrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, here I want to recognize a PIC
nutrition guide and top topics norwich
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding guidelines in addition to the
studies above.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more stuff here that is
really interesting to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, high fiber inside diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it really boosts the
voluntary water intake during the spirit
[SPEAKER_01]: in late pregnancy around farrowing and
early lactation.
[SPEAKER_01]: See high fiber, 22% NDF versus half of
that really pushes the water intake in
[SPEAKER_01]: these cells, which is essential to reduce
constipation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really cool study that has been
done looking at how fiber feeding actually
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes increases prolactin serum
concentration during this period around
[SPEAKER_01]: giving birth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prolactin in itself being such an
important hormone because it is essential
[SPEAKER_01]: for initiating and maintaining lactation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the initiation of lactation could have
something to do with the fact that with
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding wheat bran at this high level,
we're able to actually induce farrowing in
[SPEAKER_01]: time for those cells to be more
synchronized without to intervene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really cool study here looking at
feeding roughage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're looking at straw, hay,
clover grass silage, corn silage or maize
[SPEAKER_01]: silage and artichokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing is basically the
litter weight at day 35 being higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the hay, the clover grass silage and
the artichoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking here a little bit
something different here as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: individual pig weight here greater than
control for the hay, the clover grass
[SPEAKER_01]: silage and the artichoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, some promising data here,
promising studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, I had to mention this
because to me, this is so telling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber addition roughage reduces basically
lipopolysaccharides and C-reactive
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are endotoxins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically this lower inflammatory
markers in colostrum of those cells that
[SPEAKER_01]: are fed these roughages may help support
neonatal immune development and reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: stress on the cell at farrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this study here,
[SPEAKER_01]: what Kesnell and all did is that they're
providing high fiber feed to increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: NDF to basically to 32% here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing the control 32%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see that, it's important to
mention this because when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seed meal, we're gonna have
consequences as far as the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all these ingredients here that
are added to increase the fiber content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, I'm sorry about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lysine concentration, the true SID
refers to similar to the true digestible
[SPEAKER_01]: lysine content of this diet reduces from
0.56 to 0.46.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the feed intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also boosting the feeding take of
those cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, the amount of
nutrients daily requirement is met.
[SPEAKER_01]: What these people have shown is that
clearly the average daily gain of those
[SPEAKER_01]: piglets is improved and the liver gain
also is improved when we start feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: those animals at day 25 of gestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that cells gestation length
is 114, 115 days of gestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this, what I'd like to do here is that
basically just mentioned here that the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that we just provided here are a
strong justification for exploring novel
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber sources like hemp seed meal and cell
diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that we have positive influences on
lactation performance and cell welfare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this slide here is here because I
wanted to show you that in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crude protein requirement and the lysine
requirement, again, this is on a
[SPEAKER_01]: digestible basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a lysine to crude protein
ratio of about five and about five and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half to 5.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these numbers, let's keep these in mind
when we're looking at the lysine profile
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp seed meal, because hemp seed meal
with the lysine profile could actually
[SPEAKER_01]: replace about, provide about half of the
lysine in those cell diets because of its
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally good amino acid profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did here is I took this diet,
let me go back here, okay, and I replaced
[SPEAKER_01]: the fiber part by hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially having 58.5% of the diet as
in seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't calculate the fermentable
fiber percentage because I do not know how
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentable those fibers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something else that we would have
to look into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're looking at boosting NDF to
31%, right, is basically by replacing
[SPEAKER_01]: those fibers, we come up with the same
fiber content as basically what we had
[SPEAKER_01]: before is about 32 in the previous diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the SID lysine, right,
0.66%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're above requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could lower this hemp seed meal and
put something else in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this is just a very crude
estimate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go through all the nitty gritty
of the profile, but it's just showing you
[SPEAKER_01]: the potential here of filling that gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Providing this NDF to little cells,
providing this bulk because to reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: society, to reduce this hunger,
and because they're less active,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in confinement, they need to be
less hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically the bottom line,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So 31%, 32, 0.66 SID lysine versus 0.46.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on into looking at the
protein quality of hemp seed meal and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the work that has been done looking at
protein quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, we're looking at, I mean,
it's the composition, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably seen that before,
but it doesn't hurt to revise this topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, the whole seed versus de-hauled
seeds versus seed meal, hemp seed meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and versus the hauls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing here is that our
hemp seed meal is, we're gonna go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: those highlighted in a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a nice lysine content of 1.3%
relative to the other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also one that is really interesting is
the sulfur amino acid, like methionine,
[SPEAKER_01]: methionine plus cysteine, and hemp seed
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I wanted to mention here,
looking at this slide, is to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_01]: the variation in the coefficient of
variation in those different products for
[SPEAKER_01]: lysine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go to hemp seed meal, we got 16 to
20% variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 22% for crude protein, 40.7,
22% variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hemp seed meal is 16 to 28% for lysine
in particular, and hauls is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: variable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more processing we get into we're
gonna get into some of the losses as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the variation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is getting a little bit more
interesting here as we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing hemp seed meal products to other
products of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have flax seed meal,
which is really popular in force feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have soybean meal, again,
very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Source for protein for horse feed,
and of course for pig feed here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flax seed meal, which is also called
linseed meal, more so in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: and hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the amino acid profile,
and this is the amino acid profile
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to the crude protein content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking here at 3.3 for
soybean, for lysine, 1.4, 1.4 here for
[SPEAKER_01]: flax seed meal and hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar in this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the protein quality or the
profile here, 6.2% of the protein is
[SPEAKER_01]: composed of lysine, 4% of the protein is
composed of lysine and a flax seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: linseed meal, and 3.2, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is actually a really good number
where we're considering where to use and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to use hemp seed meal for horse feed,
which are animals that require relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: low protein diets and for gestating
sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here you have your hemp seed meal
along with flax seed that offer great
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for sulfur amino acids,
more so in the methionine for hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little bit complicated,
but I just wanted to mention that this
[SPEAKER_01]: study was done in rats using rodents,
and this is more applicable to human where
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually look at protein quality and
the protein digestibility, corrected amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid score.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have a speaker that did talk
about that in terms of human application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again here, col-expelled hemp seed meal
compared to col-expelled linseed meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit less in terms of their
protein digestibility, corrected amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid score for lysine, but then for
methionine, and both in terms of the score
[SPEAKER_01]: and the PDCAA, superior by far for your
hemp seed meal products or hemp products
[SPEAKER_01]: in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variation in digestibility,
and that's going to be true for all animal
[SPEAKER_01]: species we're going to be testing in,
is that the more the NDF, the lower the
[SPEAKER_01]: protein digestibility, but we're still
looking at really relatively high protein
[SPEAKER_01]: digestibility anywhere in a baritone of 95
plus to over 95%, so 85 to 95%,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking here at this really nice
study that was done by Hook Presto et al
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2011, there's really not a whole lot of
studies out there looking at hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: meal compared to linseed canola meal and
fava bean and soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here what we're seeing is that very high
NDF in hemp seed meal, beautiful lysine
[SPEAKER_01]: content, a little bit lower than canola,
a little bit lower than the legume and
[SPEAKER_01]: soybean, but fair in comparison to linseed
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, our sulfur amino acid content
are way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's even more interesting is the total
track and intestinal digestibility of pigs
[SPEAKER_01]: that are fed hemp seed meal and other
protein ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here, drawing your attention,
there's a lot of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking here at apparent
digestibility for hemp seed meal compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to flax seed, canola, bean, and soybean,
what we're seeing here is on an apparent
[SPEAKER_01]: digestibility basis, hemp seed meal is
doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are inclusion rate near 25% of the
diet in those pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A quarter of the diet containing hemp seed
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're looking in terms of putting this
into true digestibility values for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pigs, we're doing really well again here
in terms of lysine, same as flax seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: canola, lower than legume, which is not
surprising, and lower than soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although soybean meal was not part of the
study, I added this column here,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's why there are no layers for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good digestibility for methionine
and really not much difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: other amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, really good quality protein,
highly digestible for pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we're looking for horses here,
I call this the perfect feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: convenience because of the composition of
this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the proximate composition,
crude protein will vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I've used the data from Springing and
All that did a really cool study looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at palatability of hemp seed meal in
horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at the data right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at NDF, hemp seed meal is
very high, beet pulp is high too,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the high content of NDF in beet pulp
is a lot of it is due to basically pectin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of pectin in beet pulp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have our rice bran and commercial
concentrate, and just here as a standalone
[SPEAKER_01]: standard are bermuda grass, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crude fat, this is a 10.7 percent,
I've seen 12 percent crude fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice bran is 17 percent, and we like to
use that in horse feed because of its fat
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it has some NDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's bran, but it has a high
fat content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at basically comparing hemp
seed meal to adult's other common
[SPEAKER_01]: products, it has a nice profile,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in terms of non-structural
carbohydrate, which was what we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of time for some good feed for
horse balancer, non-fiber carbohydrate or
[SPEAKER_01]: non-structural non-fiber, starch content,
water-soluble carbohydrate, and simple
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp seed meal is going to be low in all
those compared to common feed stuffs in
[SPEAKER_01]: horse concentrates or ration balancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very low starch content among a lot of
them except for rice bran, you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: more starch in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, low starch, low water-soluble
carbohydrate, low simple sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: high NDF, going back to my proximate
composition here on top, relatively nice
[SPEAKER_01]: content of fat, and a little bit lower in
energy because of the NDF nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we have some really good
potential here again for pregnant sows and
[SPEAKER_01]: horse concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I just wanted to stress again how
content of starch and bran makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to mitigate the starch
concentration of horse balancers when we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get the energy level, and then we
have all the starch that we're bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always some worries here that we need to
balance for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at acceptance of hemp seed meal
in horses, and this was the study done by
[SPEAKER_01]: Springer et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having six days of repeated offering
of one kilogram of either hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: pellets or bermudagrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: This acceptance study, those horses are
giving a limited amount of time to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume, so they're not consuming the
entire amount that you're giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is that once these
horses got used to this hemp seed meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a novel ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never ate it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were used to this coastal
bermudagrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly but surely, it's different,
still different, and then it start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time these horses have reached five
days, they're basically same four to five
[SPEAKER_01]: days as the horses as basically preferring
or consumption of grass, and then by day
[SPEAKER_01]: six, superior intake, superior acceptance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely very palatable for those
horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again here, another comparison done with
not the grass hay this time, but beet
[SPEAKER_01]: pulp, very common, very popular
ingredient, soybean meal and rice bran
[SPEAKER_01]: pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing here compared to hemp
seed meal, we have much greater
[SPEAKER_01]: palatability of the hemp seed,
greater than soybean meal, and similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: the rice bran pellets, which is a very
popular ingredient again in horse feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a small study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still ongoing, and this is in
preparation to a much larger study that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be beginning next fall and
next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was funded by the Department of Ag
and Market and FFAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically a pile study still
ongoing because in this study by spring
[SPEAKER_01]: and all, we were looking at relatively
smaller intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to push it to a 40 percent
inclusion rate in a balancer and see how
[SPEAKER_01]: these horses would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this project was meant to look at
digestibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have not received all the data on
the internal markers such as lignin to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to give us what we need to figure out
the digestibility of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we provided four different
concentrate at increasing inclusion rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offered those concentrate slowly until
we reach 0.4 percent of the horse's body
[SPEAKER_01]: weight as a full concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the ratio of hay to hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here what we're seeing is that,
again, this is our diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're reducing the amount of oats,
reducing the amount of soybean meal to
[SPEAKER_01]: almost no soybean meal, increasing our
hemp seed meal percentage for this
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate from 10 to 40 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kept Timothy pellets constant,
corn constant, and foreign oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crude protein, these are the analyzed
values, repeating this diet here to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: there was an error with the analysis,
but there were all around 20 percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: should have been all around 20 percent
crude protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the increase in NDF here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We push it to about 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the goal and minimizing starch to
22.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did here is that we had some Amish
company that build us some really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: manure bags so we can have clean manure
collection with no contamination with the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can basically collect these feces over
a six-hour period or whatever period we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to collect for as long as we empty
the bags as it gets pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different color-coded to mix the
different diets here for the students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initial results, basically no refusal of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They consume on average 0.87 kilogram of
hemp seed meal per day, so almost one
[SPEAKER_01]: kilogram of hemp seed meal per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we were showing that we could
reduce the starch intake to less than one
[SPEAKER_01]: gram per kilogram body weight with this
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The control diet was relatively low in
starch to begin with, lower than what
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd find out there actually because I
was trying to be very careful because
[SPEAKER_01]: these are Cornell research horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be careful what we do with
them, what we expose them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was being conservative with the control
diet here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, no change in weight and fecal scar
was normal throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: These horses did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In conclusion, the hemp seed meal
palatability in horses does not differ
[SPEAKER_01]: from that of rice bran and basically is
superior to other common feces used to
[SPEAKER_01]: formulate concentrate or ration balancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about the typo here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inclusion rate of 40 percent in horse
ration balancers or concentrate is
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionally complete, palatable,
and safe for horses at the risk of large
[SPEAKER_01]: intestinal dysfunction and metabolic
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low starch, moderately high in fat,
high in MDF, and adequate in lysine to
[SPEAKER_01]: crude protein for horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sounds, we have hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we did a very small study,
a couple of small studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in addition with the other studies
that have been done looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: digestibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this one, we did two small study.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was for acceptability because we
couldn't find data on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not find data on acceptability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also looking at whole-track digestibility,
not small intestinal, but whole-track.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did here is we formulated those diets
to contain up to 15 percent hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are growing pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be careful how much you can
add in terms of fibrous food because it
[SPEAKER_01]: can limit their feed intake and their
nutrient intake and their growth rate if
[SPEAKER_01]: the aim is to grow those animals for
production, which is not the case for
[SPEAKER_01]: pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, basically, we decreased the
wheat bran to zero and increased the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way, we could have a diet that was
balanced as close as possible for MDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best we could do here,
but keeping the SID lysine constant to
[SPEAKER_01]: meet the requirement without adding
crystalline amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A step further would actually to be
working with real refined diets and adding
[SPEAKER_01]: crystalline amino acid to target our amino
acid level if we need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had several constraints here,
but nonetheless, if we're looking also we
[SPEAKER_01]: had a very high fat diet because we had so
much MDF in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to meet the energy requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing here is that those pigs
ate gobble up the food really well for all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different diets here to control 10
percent, 15 percent and the daily gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pigs fed the 10 percent did well,
but they crashed a little bit at the 15
[SPEAKER_01]: percent inclusion rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gain to feed ratio going to the 15
percent was lower compared to control and
[SPEAKER_01]: the 10 percent hemp seed or tended to be
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This other study that we repeated just
using control on 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again here, we didn't find difference in
feed intake and daily gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did whole track protein
digestibility, no difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I said feed to gain before,
hopefully I said gain to feed is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: again here showing that there was no
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final conclusion here so I can wrap up a
little bit later than I was hoping to,
[SPEAKER_01]: not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp seed meal amino acid profile is
comparable to that of flax seed and canola
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, which are sources of protein in
growing pig diets in certain regions and
[SPEAKER_01]: superior source of sulfur amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this amino acid profile to me is
something that I see a lot of potential
[SPEAKER_01]: more so in pregnant cells that don't
require as much lysine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp seed meal amino acid digestibility
does not differ in some cases as greater
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to other protein supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the meal could provide half of the
lysine and gestation diets and 30 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: NDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a really powerful ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 10 percent inclusion rate, we maintain
growth rate, feed intake, and gain to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we increase that inclusion rate,
we don't maintain feed intake and the rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of gain in those pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total track digestibility was the same
whether we have zero hemp seed meal or 10
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The palatability of hemp seed meal for
pigs is indicative of palatability for
[SPEAKER_01]: gestating cells and undeniably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we really need, of course,
larger and longer-term studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to looking at pregnant cells as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just use growing pigs as proxy
for cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that we have pretty good
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could hypothesize that those cells will
do pretty well on this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, fermentability potential of hemp
seed meal is really needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have a better understanding on
how fermentable the fiber in hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: meal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to acknowledge in
hemp, especially Trey Riddle, for
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying me with the hemp seed meal I've
needed to have for those file studies
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been conducting and helping us
actually move forward with a larger grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry Smart and Joel Watchlab,
which are great mentors to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically made me discover the wonders of
hemp products, my students, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cornell Teaching and Research Funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learned so much about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use my host privileges to ask
the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would the hemp seed meal be replacing
another ingredient that is being used or
[SPEAKER_00]: it plays more of a role of complementing
the rations?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is whether we're looking at
replacing everything with hemp seed meal
[SPEAKER_01]: or can we look at it that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the horse studies,
those horses, they were just offered hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: seed meal pellets without anything else in
the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just loved them, loved this diet,
loved this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it could probably be used as
perhaps as a main fiber source
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have all the supply that we need,
these horses eat a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The availability might be the constraint
here, not so much the nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a complementary ingredients,
of course, I think it has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: availability, not so much a nutritional
constraint in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, more work is needed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can work on the availability side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a couple of questions in
the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one from Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked at feeding hemp forage to
sows and horses?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which question is that, Lucia?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questions from, I see that the webinar
chat, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a Q&A with a red bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I wasn't a good student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have listened to you better
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, have you looked at feeding
hemp forage to sows and horses?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it would be, you know,
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing though that we have to keep in
mind is the cannabinoid profile perhaps in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leafy part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right now, we're looking at the
seed products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are, I think, the constraints here
is residues, cannabinoid profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether or not that could be ever
approved by the Center for Veterinary
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine or FDA and AFCO because of the
concerns with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that, you know,
assuming that they're palatable,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be great to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael asked a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend hemp seed meal for chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, hemp seed meal has been approved
for laying hens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of you might know this,
but it's been approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, chickens, we're having a broiler
study here that is beginning this fall or
[SPEAKER_01]: spring, and looking at inclusion rates,
how much we can include of hemp seed meal
[SPEAKER_01]: and broilers, looking at meat quality,
growth rate, feed intake, and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have a better idea of what it
looks like for broiler chickens,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, eight months from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I see, could you please share a
bit about the specific hemp seed meal
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using for these studies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this whole seed pressed, sterilized,
roasted, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my understanding is that these are
basically within, they've been expelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the oil has been removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're down to about 10 to 12% fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and very low starch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have low starch, high NDF,
moderate amount of fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically, they've been
extruded, I'm sorry, expelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to remove the oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'm answering your question,
TJ here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trey is on the call, maybe he could jump
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, is the hemp seed used for the feed
studies de-hauled?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is de-hauling required?
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is that these are not
de-hauled because the NDF content is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, correct me if I'm wrong,
Trey, if you're here or anybody else from
[SPEAKER_01]: in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denise, are you noting hemp seed meal,
which is from pressed oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you are noting, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the only version of hemp feed
looked at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the whole seed or ground de-hauled
seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is whole seed or ground de-hauled?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going back to the question before
to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the NDF content, these are likely not
de-hauled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I need some, I have Larry here that
is Morgan and TJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Trey, it is expelled, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press full seed, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so they're not de-hauled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with that kind of NDF, I would have
been surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Larry, for helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Tyler, thank you for the insightful
talk, Natalie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Tyler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Denise, again, hopefully we've answered
your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, is the only version of hemp feed
looked at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, right now, in terms of those
studies, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure there's going to be lots more
to come here in the next few months or
[SPEAKER_01]: years as this is becoming a really hot
topic for good reason, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Judson, very informative presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Judson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate those comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Larry, Larry here is saying that we
are seeing adoption of high-olivic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: for dairy feed due to increase in milk
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the fatty acid content of MC meal oil
important for sows and milk production?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a high-olivic hemp line we are
just starting to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the interest of time,
I decided not to talk about fatty acids
[SPEAKER_01]: because I felt I had so much to cover to
kind of set the tone a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're looking at for animals and what
kind of digestive system they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of fatty acid profile,
again, this is something that in sow
[SPEAKER_01]: lactation is of great interest,
especially as we're looking at health of
[SPEAKER_01]: those piglets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of potential here
to looking at high-olivic and the fatty
[SPEAKER_01]: acid profile of the milk that those sows
would be fed with different hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: products, definitely, and the impact on
piglet growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was hemp seed meal stored?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long can it be stored without
refrigeration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Concern over mycotoxins are brought in
during storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm going to need the experts here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in the case of my studies,
when we received the hemp seed meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: we placed the hemp seed meal in a facility
that is dry and not warm, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's tournament and environmental
temperature regulated, wasn't cooled,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had it for about three months
before we started the trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as long-term storage, there is some
potential issues because of the fat
[SPEAKER_01]: content and rancidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I would not want to get into this
area because I would prefer leaving that
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of those experts like Larry and
Morgan, of course, and then Trey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But super important question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a comment here from Sarah,
I think to everyone too, but I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight that these are expensive trials
on high-value animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being careful with them
trying to improve all aspects of animal
[SPEAKER_01]: feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Sarah, for the great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a lot to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this stuff wouldn't be possible
without our students, the hemp growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: my mentors, I call them my mentors,
even though they're not official,
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry and Joe, and all the staff around
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two more studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a big, big trial
coming up with horses, dairy cows,
[SPEAKER_01]: and chickens this upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to doing all that
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feed smells really good, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're mixing the feed, my student
always go, I want to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, you can go, but I don't
want to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really important studies indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remind everyone that we've
recorded the webinar and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: uploading it to our SIBS YouTube channel
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Natalie and everyone for
connecting, for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice rest of your week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
