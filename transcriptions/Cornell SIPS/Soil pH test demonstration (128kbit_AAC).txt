[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we've been talking about the
physical aspects of soil, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical aspect of soil that we can test
very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is pH, which measures the acidity or
alkalinity of any substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in soils, pH determines very much what
nutrients are available to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some plants can tolerate a wide range
of pH, and some have a very narrow range
[SPEAKER_01]: of pH where they grow well in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to know this in terms of plant
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH test is very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a Cornell pH kit, which is a
colorimetric test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll try two different soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two parts of the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a standard, and one is a wide
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always start with the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these cups where we're going to
put a little bit of soil in one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: depressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to fill it up just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to take one of the
reagents here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always start with bromothymol blue,
which is the neutral range.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to start with the neutral range,
and then we can go up more alkaline or go
[SPEAKER_01]: down more acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using bromothymol blue, we're going to
drop, drop by drop
[SPEAKER_01]: until we have a little bit of free
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to mix this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about 10 or 20 seconds so that the
reagent mixes with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to allow that
solution to go down the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, there's quite a bit of soil
there, but I can still see a color.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're looking for is the color in the
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a color chart to determine what
that pH is saying, is reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this chart, it says bromothymol
blue on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I look at the color, we find in
the channel versus the color chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say somewhere between 6.0 and 6.2
based on the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the chart, maybe 6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if we're at one end of the color
chart, we want to go further because we
[SPEAKER_01]: may not see exactly what the final pH
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we'll use another reagent
in the kit, which goes from pH 5 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the lower edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take another bit of soil from our
sample, put it in the other bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using chlorophenol red, we're going to
wet the sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it by tapping it so that the solution
bathes the soil in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to allow that bead to go
down the channel back to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to use the color chart at
the bottom, which says chlorophenol red,
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what our color is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see we're at the 6.2 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in fact, the 6.2, which we saw with
bromothymol blue, is correct because we
[SPEAKER_01]: corroborated that with another solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it's 6, 6.2, pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it's about 6 to 6.2 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the final determination
for this soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we're changing soils and we're
going to do another soil or another
[SPEAKER_01]: sample, we always want to clean our plate
with deionized water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to change, use the pH
of the tap water to change our reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have another soil here, which we're
going to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell anything about the soil by
looking at it in terms of what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that determines, very importantly,
how much certain elements are available to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put a little bit of soil
in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start again with bromothymol blue,
which is the neutral range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop, drop, drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little bit of free solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixing it with the soil and then getting a
bead down the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, instead of that kind of
yellowish green, we have almost a
[SPEAKER_01]: blue-green color, which would be at the
end of the bromothymol blue chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of 7.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, being that we're at the end,
we need to go further to see if that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: final range of pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we take the wide range test kit,
which goes higher with phenol red or much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower with bromothymol green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go higher with phenol red
because we stopped at 7.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go up in terms of seeing what
the real pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're going to put some more soil
in the second bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you want to have your hands
clean when you do this so you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing anything into the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're going to take phenol red,
which is the wide, high range,
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what this soil actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you see the color change when
you're mixing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to get a bead down
the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're looking for is the film,
the color film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we use the color chart
for phenol red, which is pretty bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we're seeing we're not up at 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more toward, I'd say, it's quite
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably at 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8.4 or 8.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have much more alkaline soil here
than we did in the first sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to determine which plants
can grow well in some of those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to know that for plant
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very simple test that you can
do without any special equipment.
