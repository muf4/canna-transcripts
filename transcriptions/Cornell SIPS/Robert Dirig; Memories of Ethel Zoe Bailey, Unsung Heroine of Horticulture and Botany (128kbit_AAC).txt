[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have one question for you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, when you gave this talk to
what I call the Fern Conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you gave the talk to the Fern
Conference, one of the questions from the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience was how much participation did
Ethel Zobaley, how much did she contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years, and what were some of the
activities that she contributed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the activities that she contributed on,
not only at the Barium, but when they did
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you talk just a few moments about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you recording?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early, after she graduated from
Smith College, she came home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went on some of the early trips,
obviously the one to Venezuela and the one
[SPEAKER_00]: to Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe also to Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, I think she mostly was,
she came along as an assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know at one point she had a conflict
with Bailey and with Liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said she wasn't going as a slave
or a servant or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just didn't, she didn't like not
having a little more respect maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to remember that Bailey didn't
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another thing that she did
was she had a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the first woman to have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she drove then all the way across the
country and back on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a couple of trips to collect
plants in the southern part of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know where plants were still
flourishing in the warmer parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also did much of the organization
and processing of the specimens later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the labels are in her hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some are by him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she did probably most of the mounting
and operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also was a profoundly good kind of
editor and information gatherer and
[SPEAKER_00]: organizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, being the curator was not
just your bearing, but it also involved
[SPEAKER_00]: curating, organizing the information that
they accumulated, which was all done by
[SPEAKER_00]: hand in those days because they didn't
have computers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand she also did editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: She helped with refining, editing,
and just maybe streamlining some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned in what I talked about several
of them, and particularly the Hortus
[SPEAKER_00]: encyclopedias, things like that,
those big, huge efforts like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take a huge amount of effort and
cooperation to produce those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand she was a major
contributor to Hortus Second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is on the first one, too,
and the encyclopedias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually knew her because she came
in and volunteered after she, quote,
[SPEAKER_01]: retired at age in 1957.
[SPEAKER_01]: I retired in 1957.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came in until 1983.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met her a few times during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she worked with it within two weeks
of her death, as I recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was more like a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she used to sit inside the front
office of the Hortorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of surreal to go in there
because her father's life-size portrait,
[SPEAKER_00]: when he was Dean, was in back of her on
the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked just like him, except she was
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was sort of startling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a double tape when you came into
the office, and she sat behind a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: cabinets that had thousands of
three-by-five cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did all day, essentially,
was go through the incoming catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would have them open, propped
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single entry in the catalog
would have an X on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would find the card for the
company, the nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd write, say, 1980, page 7,
Berkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Berkey card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she'd do that every year for
every catalog that came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are thousands and thousands of
those cards that are still in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hortorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you have any idea how many,
with the time of her death, approximately
[SPEAKER_01]: how many catalogs were in that collection?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said, I'd said in here,
I think it was 80,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be on the old Hortorium website
when we put the first version of it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably still is, if they have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bailey just kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were resources for his developing
career in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the teaching of that was
new in the late 1800s as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not new, but it was being
crystallized in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just kept all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had full runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Harris in Rochester didn't
have volume one, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his being so well organized in
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a great archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say probably in her later
years, that was her major contribution was
[SPEAKER_01]: the catalog collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she retired, that's basically what.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used to drive her car way up into her
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she had faculty status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she parked on Tower Road right near
Plant Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a red car, I remember,
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the place where I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on a ride in it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either Toyota or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went out with bundles of unmounted
plants under her arms because she listened
[SPEAKER_00]: to the opera on Saturday afternoons on the
radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she mounted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would bring them back Monday
morning, all flued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that special?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful that she was able to do all
that work and just keep herself going.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lived alone until the last year or
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, her contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't know of her
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, she's an unmoved, largely
unsung heroine of a horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she also, logistically,
she liked cooking and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they were in the field, there's a
story somewhere where they were put up in
[SPEAKER_00]: a local village in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were given an empty hut of chicken
that was lying for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to dispatch it and cook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an amazing life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would not talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Liberty would talk to her for just a
few minutes, according to reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'd say, well, let's get back to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came from an era when women didn't
talk about themselves too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she did share one time that when they
were in Panama, the colorful version is
[SPEAKER_00]: that she took a refreshing dip in the
local pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the log came coming, and she just
escaped the snap of jaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't say it so dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fascinating to hear her talk
about anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had been in many parts of the
world in Europe and all the way to China
[SPEAKER_00]: and Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they touched down in Seoul on the
way from Japan to China too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the New Zealand trip, in 1914,
he did a series of lectures that were
[SPEAKER_00]: invited in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took a steamer all the way in,
all the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in that context that he had the
piece to write the Holy Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a long trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be 16 hours from LAX Airport
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could imagine on a steamer how long
it would take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably stopped at different
points with mail on the way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a slightly different question
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's to do with photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that we had Bailey start taking
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did cyanotypes and took pictures of
a lot of plants, obviously, or cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Ethel involved in the photography,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did she print the photos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you ever hear that she was involved
in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there were reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed the negatives in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one motel, they had to use the
electricity for lights at night or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to print them and not pull the
electricity out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think probably it was he.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she would deal with getting them
onto sheets with the palms and making the
[SPEAKER_00]: envelopes to put them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any negatives that I found,
and he left glass negatives, five by seven
[SPEAKER_01]: glass negatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they took that format.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in paper envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I'm asking is all of them
had Bailey's writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see Ethel's writing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think she was directly involved in
that except with handling the later film
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives, which is what we almost totally
have at the Oratory collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of his larger photo projects,
I think, was when he did the work on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made all the crosses, and he made sure
he took pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a big book of cyanotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: F1 and then the F2, so maybe further on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tours for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the interesting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He certainly put a lot of effort into that
genetics project, and it was something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in the 1890s when he first
came here.
