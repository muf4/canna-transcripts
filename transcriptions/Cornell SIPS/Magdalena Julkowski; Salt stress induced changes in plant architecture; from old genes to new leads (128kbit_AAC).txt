[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for such a kind
introduction and giving me an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak in front of such a wise and
esteemed audience of plant scientists of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research, I was lucky enough to
develop my research from my PhD all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through my position as a group leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take you through that
journey, starting with what really amazed
[SPEAKER_00]: me as a plant scientist is that plants,
although they have their preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat, they still manage to grow over a
wide range of different habitats from
[SPEAKER_00]: almost desert-like habitats where there is
a high range of daily temperatures all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the tropics where the range of
temperatures is very narrow, humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's also quite interesting is that
we, as a human species, manage to build
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural systems throughout those
different habitats as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got people that are doing
agriculture in Australia, as crazy as it
[SPEAKER_00]: might sound, to Europe and India and
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but right now, as probably most of you
are aware of, our agricultural systems are
[SPEAKER_00]: being challenged by the climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, we've got an overview of what
are the challenges to the agriculture in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that a lot of those risks are
represented by blue, which is representing
[SPEAKER_00]: the water availability, or rather the lack
of water availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times when there is no fresh water
available, people are doing irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in turn is resulting in soil
salinization over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we improve or manage that our
agricultural systems are resilient against
[SPEAKER_00]: those changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way of doing that is to domesticate
species that are already loving the
[SPEAKER_00]: extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this desert rose,
which in my Photoshop fantasy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some very juicy fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, the fruits of the desert rose
are not very appealing to eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe with some genetic engineering,
we can domesticate them and make them
[SPEAKER_00]: produce something that we, as humans,
are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strategy is looking into an
intraspecific variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variation that already exists
within the species we like to eat or use
[SPEAKER_00]: for other purposes, or exploring the
variation within the species that are
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related to the species that we
like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we start to equip our
agricultural systems with all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: different mechanisms of resilience,
we still need to understand what are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the plant responses to applying
those resilience mechanisms as efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible with as little yield damages
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm focusing on the salt stress,
and salt is usually occurring in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, when they are exposed to
the salt, the first reaction is to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: pump all of the ions out of the root
against the gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as pumping anything against the
gradient, it is very energetically
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and over the long term,
not very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another part of the response is
whenever the salt is accumulated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in very patches, the plant will
propagate its roots mainly in the portions
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil that is not that much affected
by salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's known as a negative halotropism,
which we described in the Christus lab
[SPEAKER_00]: with Carlos Galv√°n Empuria.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at some point, plant needs to
take up the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes up ions and uses them as an
osmoticum to be able to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic conductivity into the root and
all the way so that the plant can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the salt concentration is high,
at some point the leaves that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest that have been exposed to salinity
for the longest time, they are undergoing
[SPEAKER_00]: a premature senescence and the yield is
probably slightly decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the concentrations of the salt in
the soil is reaching the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: apparatus in the younger leaves,
they're also undergoing premature
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence and the yield is basically
negligible of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you see, the whole, this overall
salinity tolerance of the plant is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty complex thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's comprised of multiple processes that
are compounding on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why there is this example of the
study of Cotoriidae from a decade ago
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, where they studied the
different accessions of Arabidopsis and
[SPEAKER_00]: looked throughout time when watered with
quite high salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is equivalent of Red Sea salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at how those plants are
surviving or not surviving throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they failed to identify any genetic
components because they were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity tolerance as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're trying to look at map
all of those different processes at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, you simply don't have enough
statistical power to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was told very early on in my
career is to focus on specific tissues or
[SPEAKER_00]: specific processes that you hypothesize
are contributing to salinity tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might comment on that later when
talking about high throughput phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without knowing any better,
I decided to focus on root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when as a PhD student, I started
growing those Arabidopsis plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing concentrations of salt,
I observed that, yeah, plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more salt you add, the smaller they
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question that I really,
really was excited about addressing is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the salt or stress in general only
delaying plant development or is it really
[SPEAKER_00]: reprogramming it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I scratched my head for a couple of
minutes to figure out how are we going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to look at the dynamics of
root development throughout time and under
[SPEAKER_00]: different salt stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we basically did is we germinated
the plants under control conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at four day old, the root,
there's just the main roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much architecture per se to a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at four day, we transplanted those
seedlings into zero, 75 and 125 millimolar
[SPEAKER_00]: of salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we scan those plates, very high tech
technology, scanning of the plates every
[SPEAKER_00]: second day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to observe how the plants are
developing under those different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, we also quantified this
development using a semi-automatic or
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-manual software called EZrizo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we had the heaps of data,
I had to think about how to synthesize it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that I can really make
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I set up a very simple
model to describe the growth of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system architecture per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I divided it into three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting with this main root that
is just a tiny little root at the four
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that root is growing with a certain
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could fit a quadratic function into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the starting point,
and then you've got the growth rate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, you also have lateral roots
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the speed at which the lateral roots
are emerging is also the increase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral root number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also fit similar type of
function in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have the outgrowth of
those lateral roots, which you can then
[SPEAKER_00]: measure with fit an average lateral root
length speed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you can summarize the entire
dynamic of the root system architecture in
[SPEAKER_00]: just three numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by adding and multiplying them
together, we could definitely predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: total root size of the entire root system,
which was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I quantified all of those
different parameters in the three
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions for the main roots,
number of lateral roots, and average
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral root growth, what I observe is
that you've got the decrease, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: salt you add, the slower individual
components are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're using the same kind of
family of mathematical formula,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is a quadratic formula,
we can actually compare the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by salt between individual
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we calculate the relative change
in the main roots, number of lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, and average lateral root growth
between those components, we observe that
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colombia, which is a reference genotype
of Arabidopsis, the main root is impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: much more severely than the number of
lateral roots and average lateral root
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths in both conditions, which was
pretty exciting because it means that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are not only growing just slower,
they are really growing differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they would be impacted with
exactly the same extent, then we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see any of the differences in the relative
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we quantified multiple accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we classified some of them that were
responding exactly the same as Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were having exactly the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main root kept on growing,
but the lateral roots not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also performed quantification of the
root system architecture on a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: population, which comprised 350
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this population, back then when I
was starting a PhD, we had a data set of
[SPEAKER_00]: 250,000 SNPs available, which allowed us
to do a genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so connecting our different phenotypes
of the root system architecture with the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see a typical output of the
genome-wide association in Manhattan plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: association strength on the y-axis,
and five chromosomes of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is an association that we were
most excited, and the association was with
[SPEAKER_00]: average lateral root length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why were we the most excited about
this association?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically because it was association
with HKT1, which stands for high affinity
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of salt stress field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in multiple plant species, there are a
number of HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arabidopsis, there's only one HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not transporting potassium,
but it's mainly transporting sodium into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very excited because HKT1 was
already previously mapped by Ivan Baxter
[SPEAKER_00]: to be associated with sodium accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade that we know was very much
correlated with salinity tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was not previously associated with
root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made use of the lines that were
available for those HKT1, which were
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpression lines in the Xylem-Polperi
cycle, which is a native expression site
[SPEAKER_00]: for HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is HKT1 correlated with salinity
tolerance when it's actually pumping ions
[SPEAKER_00]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key is, where is the native
expression of the HKT1?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's expressed in the Xylem-Polperi
cycles, which are the cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the transpiration stream,
and are basically sucking all of the ions
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the transpiration stream so that
sodium is not accumulating to the toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at those lines,
and the Ingo Miller generated those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: in both Columbia and C24 background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we've got the background lines and
the two lines that have an overexpression
[SPEAKER_00]: of HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grew them under control
conditions, there is not much difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as we added salt, we observed
that the plants are really suffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're mainly suffering in their
lateral root development, as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no significant differences were
observed under control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we had to think, how is that
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: So HKT1, as I already told you,
is expressed around Xylem-Polperi cycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: around Xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the same tissue that is
giving origin to the lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you over accumulate those ions in
this very tiny, precious little lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: root primordia, they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, OK, this is a good
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's test it in another biological
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lines, wheat lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wheat has five HKT1 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make it easier, HKT1 that is the
most homologous to arabidopsis one is NAX2
[SPEAKER_00]: locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, we've got the introgression
lines of another HKT1 and an HKT1 that is
[SPEAKER_00]: homologous to arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the NAX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got those lines from Ranamans and
Richard James from CSIRO in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we screened them very early on in
their development for changes in their
[SPEAKER_00]: seminal root length, lateral root number,
and lateral root length under control
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the seminal root length,
we didn't really observe that much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, either in control or in salt
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it came to a number of lateral
roots or average lateral root length,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw a little bit of a phenotype under
control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was definitely much more pronounced
under salt stress that those lines with
[SPEAKER_00]: high HKT1 expression in the wheat
developed more lateral roots, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the right phenotype in exactly the
wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, again, back to the drawing
board, scratching our heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And reviewing some basic developmental
biology and differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: monocots and dicots, well, HKT1 in wheat
is still expressed around the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lateral roots are actually originating
from the flow and pull pericycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HKT1 is giving much better protection
in the wheat without damaging the lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: root development, unlike in the
arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, at the moment, the working
hypothesis that we are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting phenomenon that we
observe is that when we supplement it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so HKT1 is mainly transporting sodium,
but it also transports a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And salt stress is not only about iron
accumulation, but also getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: disbalance between sodium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were wondering if we add a little
bit of potassium to the media together
[SPEAKER_00]: with our salt, can we then alleviate this
dramatic decrease in lateral root
[SPEAKER_00]: development?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although in the background lines,
the average lateral root length went down
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got higher overall
osmolarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could observe a very small but still
significant increase in the lateral root
[SPEAKER_00]: development in the lines overexpressing
HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, okay, let's use HKT1 as a
tool to learn more about what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the lateral root development under salt
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did what many people do when
they want to move forward and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis generating experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did RNA-seq, where we again germinated
those seedlings on the control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transferred them to four different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the seedling be there for 24 hours,
and then we harvested only the root from
[SPEAKER_00]: all four genotypes per experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one sample consisted of 150 to 200
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine that was harvesting
forests of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three replicates per line per
condition, and we only harvested roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after doing, oops, sorry, not the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after doing differential expression,
for individual line between control and
[SPEAKER_00]: individual treatments, we also did a
double differential expression between the
[SPEAKER_00]: background line and the line
overexpressing HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the response not only to
stress, but also to HKT1, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: background specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we did that, so here we see
differential expression in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: salt and HKT1 and C24 background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've got the same for the
Columbia background, and here we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: salt and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For C24, salt and potassium for Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the overlapping
genes, surprisingly enough, we didn't find
[SPEAKER_00]: that many genes that were overlapping
between two different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that those two different
lines are having very fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: different responses to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, in the end, we were happy to
have any overlap, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have little overlap,
it's easier to pick the genes that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the genes that we focused on was
shared between Columbia and C24 response
[SPEAKER_00]: to salt and HKT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was encoding TMAC2, which is a
negative ABA regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the relative
expression of this TMAC2 in the Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: and overexpression line in C24,
and its overexpression line, we observed
[SPEAKER_00]: that the pattern was actually,
yeah, it was significantly changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was exactly the opposite,
which was very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't get our hands on the
pattern on any of the mutants of the TMAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did measure ABA accumulation in
collaboration with, oops, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: in collaboration with Jiang Niu Wang from
Salim Albabili Lab in Kaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we observed is the pattern that
was exactly complementary to an expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of negative ABA regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever our negative ABA regulator was
upregulated, the ABA levels were down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever it was downregulated,
the ABA levels were up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be some feedback mechanisms
between this ABA negative regulator and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ABA biosynthesis itself, which I think
is quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, we're generating CRISPR
mutants in all of those background of C24
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia and both tissue-specific
overexpression lines to see, can we
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse this decrease in lateral root
emergence under salt stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another gene that we also explored was
TIP2-2, which encodes a
[SPEAKER_00]: tonoplastin-tristic protein, which is
supposedly an aquaporin, although nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: there is an increasing evidence that
aquaporins are transporting much more than
[SPEAKER_00]: just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, we observed that in both
lines of overexpression, the TIP2-2
[SPEAKER_00]: expression was upregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, we could get our hands on
TIP2-2 mutant in Columbia background,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we explored their root system
architecture under control, salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more salt conditions for total root
length, number of lateral roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and main root length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't see that much of a
difference under control conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as soon as we added salt, the
difference in the total root length was
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming more and more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figured out that it's mainly
because the TIP2-2 mutants developed much
[SPEAKER_00]: more number of lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, right now we're generating the
CRISPR mutants in the background of the
[SPEAKER_00]: UAS HKT1 lines and their retrospective
background lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we're working in collaboration
with Steve Tyerman and Caitlin Byrd in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia with the transport properties of
this TIP2-2, because it hasn't been that
[SPEAKER_00]: well characterized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was all focusing on the root
system architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a root biologist, I tend to be very
proud because I'm working on the hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the hidden half of the plant,
but it's still a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking to Mark, we realized that we
don't really know what's happening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: root-to-shoot ratio in salt stress,
unlike we know what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together with first Rashid Aid Hadu,
we developed this tool that was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer our scanned pictures into just
green, white, and blue pixels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a semi-manual analysis tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only say it's semi-manual because if
you, as a PhD, student in POSDOC gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with semi-automatic, making all of
those manual corrections, you realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite still a lot of manual work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't perfect because we were still
not able to deal with plants where the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be still a little bit of an
error, but we were willing to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of that error and use the tool to
calculate the growth rate of the root and
[SPEAKER_00]: the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again, we fitted very simple
mathematical functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're using exponential functions
to estimate the root growth and the shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of all 350 accessions of
Arabidopsis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the more stress you add,
the slower the plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more interestingly is that when
you look at the root-to-shoot growth rate
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, oops, sorry, you see that it's not
really responding in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are not getting rootier as
they would under drought stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually they are just getting
dysregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots and the shoot growth rate is
not as well coordinated as it is under
[SPEAKER_00]: control conditions, but they're just going
both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did genome-wide association and we
used shoot per total seedling area as our
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator of root-to-shoot ratio among
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the associations we found was
on chromosome 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this association was in the DUF 247,
which if you don't know stands for domain
[SPEAKER_00]: of unknown function 247.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far for creative naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was in the valley of other DUF 247.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the sequence diversity
across HapMap accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observed that there are some insertions
and deletions and that there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence divergence in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we use the newer SNP set
containing 10 million SNPs, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: provided to us by Arthur Korte,
but the threshold went up, but we found
[SPEAKER_00]: much more SNPs that were still above our
previous threshold of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found around 50 associations,
50 SNPs within this DUF 247.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we also did is we looked at all of
the SNPs that were in the coding region of
[SPEAKER_00]: the DUF 247 and performed haplotype
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grouped now the accessions not per
SNP, but just per the clusters of SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that cluster 11 was
significantly shootier than the cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: one, which contained our favorite Columbia
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started to clone those
different alleles together with Michelle,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, Michelle Alcatani, who was a PhD
student in Mark's lab, we observed that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are actually two huge 200 base pairs
insertions in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are leading to a premature stop
codon, which is basically resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of the DUF domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also know that there are 26 other
DUF 247 in Arabidopsis genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest similarity are the DUF 247
that are within the same genomic region,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are showing very little
expression similarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now in the lab at the BTI,
Haley Sussman is working on the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization of the different tDNA
insertions of not only the DAF that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, but also all of the other
ones that are in the neighboring regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also figuring out where is this DUF
247 localizing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liang is looking at the evolutionary
context of the DUF 247 in collaboration,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, with Andrew Nelson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Anna Nelson is doing molecular
characterization of the DUF 247,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at calcium binding, dimerization,
and also at those characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now for the, whatever time I've got
remaining, I want to kind of switch gears
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk about, like, do we really need to
focus on individual traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally, as a biologist,
we learn to use forward or reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and to identify the relationship
between a gene and a phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a phenotype and an allelic variation
within the gene in terms of forward
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, there's absolutely nothing
wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned which processes are important
for selling tolerance, which genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: among other genes contributing to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are all of those different genes
interacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're still missing from one
picture is all of the other traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: could potentially contribute that we are
not even hypothesizing are contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I think, where hypothesizing
and high-throughput phenotyping is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and high-throughput enabled discovery,
because then you can think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can think about the interesting
process that is of your interest and
[SPEAKER_00]: without the need to focus on only one
phenotype that you can score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can score multiple phenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are basically a relation to a
phenotype is the same as gene to a
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very elemental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Function of the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score them throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the denser you go, you can also
observe very transient processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are still occurring, but we're very
often missing when we're doing it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field or when we're doing phenotyping that
is destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can not only quantify how the phenes
contributes to overall plant performance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also what is the individual
contribution of the phenes to each other
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they are reacting and how does
interaction are changing throughout time
[SPEAKER_00]: and throughout different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some papers that are already
that where we're looking into how can we
[SPEAKER_00]: use high-throughput phenotyping into
gaining more insight, gaining more insight
[SPEAKER_00]: about the process in general, looking
beyond one phenotype and beyond one gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example is this paper that was
published with Gigi Gao in Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomics, where we basically took
Columbia and a mutant that we know is heat
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive and we phenotyped it with the
high-throughput facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we developed a logistic regression
model where we trained it on the subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the model was able to distinguish
whether a plant was a mutant or a wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type based only on the input of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could retest it on the
remaining set of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually machine learning is being seen
as this black box, but I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to look what's inside and
making the black box transparent to see
[SPEAKER_00]: which of the traits are actually used by
this logistic regression with more
[SPEAKER_00]: seriousness or being taken more seriously
into consideration how to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this, we can also learn which of
the traits are contributing to this
[SPEAKER_00]: distinction between mutant or wild type or
stress and non-stress plants and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the, this might be
a powerful approach later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another paper that is currently under
revision, but you can find the bio archive
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it is a paper that we worked
together with Mariam Aulia who focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: early responses to salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she developed a protocol to apply salt
stress in the soil and then phenotype the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the subsequent seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we end up with this big data tsunami,
which we then used for multivariate
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and machine learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we didn't use logistic
regression, but we used tree-based models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's allowed us to identify the
traits that have a high contribution to
[SPEAKER_00]: overall plant size under control and salt
stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also took that information when we
were reviewing the genome white
[SPEAKER_00]: association outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew which of the traits we should
give a little bit more love to and
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led us to identification of this
uncharacterized protein kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: which affects quantum yield under light
adapted conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the mutants show the
significant differences with Columbia for
[SPEAKER_00]: just overall plant area and plant growth,
which I think is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we would have focused on
one of the 700 associations that we found
[SPEAKER_00]: without doing this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have that much time to talk
about that, but I also was involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing multiple tools for dealing with
high amount of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MVAP is one of the results where it
allows you to do quick pre-processing of
[SPEAKER_00]: your data, identify outliers, which
usually takes quite a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also evaluate the traits for the
broadsense heritability, do some curve
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting so you can estimate the growth
rate, summary statistics, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually do ANOVA, but nobody really
does assumptions, testing assumptions for
[SPEAKER_00]: ANOVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any excuse now,
but also a lot of hypothesis generating
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, which is quantile regression,
clustering, correlation analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: PCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is based on R, but we just
package it into a user friendly clickable
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a YouTube channel and a
Twitter account where you can find quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of resources on how to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dedicated in maintaining this tool
and keeping it updated based on extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: positive feedback from the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, what I want to do at the
BTI during my appointment as an assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: professor in here, I want to focus on
species that are naturally tolerant to
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is Solanum
pimpinellifolium, which is the closest
[SPEAKER_00]: relative of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's native to the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: of South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super tolerant because it
survived in my garden in Saudi Arabia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a very good argument for
working on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very poor gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Faye from the BTI, they recently
released the reference genome for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we at KAUST sequenced 230 accessions,
which we're right now processing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP calling and making it as a useful
genome-wide association resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do with this population
is going to be our guinea pig together
[SPEAKER_00]: with Andrew Nelson, which I was hired
together with Andrew as a cluster hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read all about it on the BTI
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk that much,
but what we want to do is we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype this population using
traditional high throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scoring growth, chlorophyll
fluorescence, doing multispectral imaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, but also using raspberry
pi phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will allow us to have much higher
time density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the changes that are occurring
within minutes of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will allow us to identify things
that are very often overlooked,
[SPEAKER_00]: like quiescent phase that plants
undergoing after stress exposure and also
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly the plants recover and what
are the dynamics of this recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those high quality changes in plant
growth will allow us to select time points
[SPEAKER_00]: at which we're going to collect more
molecular phenotypes, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomics, metabolomics,
epigenomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using all of this data, we're going to
be able to perform basically like GWAS on
[SPEAKER_00]: steroids, which is not only association
between your phenotype and the SNP,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also your phenotype and the transcript
levels or metabolome levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this layered approach is going to
allow us to see which of the associations
[SPEAKER_00]: are very stable and confirmed by different
layers and also pick the ones that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: the most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the larger scheme of things,
we have a very evil plan on exploring not
[SPEAKER_00]: only pimpinellifolium, but closely related
cultivated tomato, and then also branch
[SPEAKER_00]: out to all the brassicases and later on
also to monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comparative framework will allow
us to establish which of the resilience
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms are very short range applied
and only found within the species,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium range, so applied and found within
the closely related species and long
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of framework will allow us
to see what are the mechanisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: easily transferable between the species
and what are the mechanisms that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: species specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, I wanted to thank you for
your attention, but also my group that I
[SPEAKER_00]: did a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Krista Testering Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back at University of Amsterdam,
Krista right now moved on to Wageningen
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was an excellent mentor and gave me
quite a lot of freedom in my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did a postdoc in Mark Tester's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is basically a look, a view from
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the Red Sea coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark was also an excellent mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those amazing people were great
colleagues and contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also all of the collaborators and
colleagues, students from KAUST.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, last but not least,
I wanted to thank all of my new colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the BTI who are a wonderful team
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hailey and Liang, and of course,
Andrew and Anna who were absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental when I was starting here,
just clueless about where everything was,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was doing what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the BTI senior leadership team
who managed to get me from Saudi Arabia.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Ithaca from all the places during this
weird time of COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to welcome all the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: After presentation, it's always like,
is anyone else there still?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unmute yourselves and ask a
question or you can just put it in chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magdalena, this is Wojtek.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your GWAS on steroids, you
mentioned, and I saw it in the slide,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to take the environment into
account as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if you could elaborate on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, how are you going to do it in
practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the environmental GWAS,
it's not our idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it originated from Ed Buckler.
[SPEAKER_00]: From over the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would be doing then in
environmental GWAS is collecting the GPS
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinates of all of the accessions where
they are originating in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use the environmental traits,
so annual precipitation, temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, as your phenotypic
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would then, if you've got an
overlapping association between your
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype and this environmental GWAS,
it would say, oh, this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is causing local adaptation to this
specific climate, to this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question,
Wojtek?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you'd have to pay attention to
a geographical distribution of whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: lines or accessions you're collecting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so you would always have kinship
metrics as your co-factor in your GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: that would not exclude the need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because running that as a co-factor or
running it as a separate genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association is very, very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also realized, based on the work
that I've done on Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people are like, oh,
all of those accessions are running from
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast, and therefore they must be more
affected by salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, salt is a stress that is very
difficult to make these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions based on just global data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, yeah, it's very depending on the
type of the soil that you've got and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that the west coast of
South America would be less disturbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be still good to do it,
especially with the stresses that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: planning to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only salt, but also heat stress and
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those parameters are much, much easier
to estimate from the environment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: data that is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions, anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I see nothing in chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's thank Mark Leiner for a
fantastic seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
