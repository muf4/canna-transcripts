[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Cora, for the introduction and
for the opportunity to come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here, I guess, about 12 years ago,
and I had quite an experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: as some of you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a frat party while I was here as
an invited speaker, and we didn't go last
[SPEAKER_00]: night, but there's still tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going home until tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I want to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to ask questions, I think two
good questions maybe that I won't get into
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but good questions to ask are,
how did you get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look for trouble, but trouble
finds me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, what's it like being an
entrepreneur?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that I did get into science to
try to avoid entrepreneurs and business
[SPEAKER_00]: people and especially lawyers,
but it's not really working out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you all kinds of stories as to
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually could have been a picture
from our dinner last night, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a painting of Friedrich Sir
Turner, who was a pharmacist's apprentice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and back in the early 1800s, in 1804,
1806, he was the first to isolate a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product from a plant, and it was
morphine from opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what he's doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a strange way of going
drinking with your buddies, and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely caused some problems for them
over here, but we'll get back to that in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with acknowledgements,
because I always leave it to the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I run out of time, and I don't
feel like I give enough credit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are in the lab presently,
and certainly those that have been in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lab previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sounds like you met at least
one of them recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this startup that Gaurav was
referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Epimron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the process of expanding,
and hopefully bigger things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very high-calibre scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great working with very senior
people, because I just sort of say,
[SPEAKER_00]: do this, we need to do this, and then they
go and they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a small academic lab with a
couple of post-docs and two PhD students,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some collaborators, and get lots
of funding, or over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of funding from especially Canadian
government federal sources, and more
[SPEAKER_00]: recently having the company has provided a
good means of combining sort of industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and translation of research
with continued academic quests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to support a lot of those
quests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say a little bit more
about the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy being part of the
entrepreneurial experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started this company in 2014,
and again, I think I'd be happy to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with you experiences as to why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't quite happy with the
translational capabilities at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Calgary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mean well, but they don't have the
capital to really move a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies from the state that they're
at to something that's going to be of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest to bigger multinational,
especially pharmaceutical and
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to try to do it ourselves,
and we currently have eight full-time
[SPEAKER_00]: staff members, and our business model so
far has not been, so our intention is not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually to produce opiates in yeast
fermentation, but it's to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's to basically use our knowledge
of the system and find the new parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the processes, and then move
those discoveries and intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property to intermediate and larger
partners that are able to take it
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generate a lot of IP, a lot of
patents, and we license those patents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of our biggest partners so far has
been in Trexon, which is found in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: locations across the US, so we
collaborated with one of their units
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'll get to the star of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, opium poppy is an ancient
medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cultivated, domesticated by a
number of civilizations around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: for about the last six or seven thousand
years, and in spite of its age and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long that we've been connected,
we've been connected to it, it's still our
[SPEAKER_00]: only source for all of the compounds that
you see on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So morphine and codeine are natural
compounds in the plant, noscopene and
[SPEAKER_00]: papavrene are also, they also have
pharmaceutical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a cough suppressant, papavrene is a
vasodilator, and noscopene's also being
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated for potential anti-cancer
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't made it past phase two clinical
trials yet, but also very importantly are
[SPEAKER_00]: these semi-synthetic compounds,
oxycodone, hydrocodone, and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, you hear a lot about naloxone
as an antagonist, so it's used,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very effective at treating overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you can go to pharmacies,
I don't know what the situation is like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S., but in Canada you can go to a
pharmacy and they'll give you a naloxone
[SPEAKER_00]: kit, basically with a serret in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's overdosing from fentanyl
or whatever on the, you know, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: subway, you can have that and you can save
their lives in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: By having this available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these compounds are semi-synthetic,
the backbone comes from the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll tell you more about that shortly,
but then they are modified through some
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical processes to get these additional
functional groups on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so again, I like to start with,
I like to connect with these plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of why they're important to
humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a plant that we've had a long,
long relationship with as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that evidence in
archeological discoveries, especially all
[SPEAKER_00]: through Europe and the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are locations where there's been
some sort of opium poppy artifact that
[SPEAKER_00]: often goes back to the Bronze Age,
you know, so three, 4,000 years BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find these poppy capsules in various
artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cave of the bats here in Spain is one
of the prime locations where you find
[SPEAKER_00]: these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking last night about how
interested I am one day when I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wealthy enough, not now,
but to get my hands on some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: material and do some ancient DNA
sequencing and see what those poppy
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties were like and try to trace,
you know, how did this plant get around?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did people move it around and connect
that anthropologically with the history
[SPEAKER_00]: with our history as, you know,
as humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ancient empires are all connected with
opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bunch of them listed here and
you can see it again in archeological
[SPEAKER_00]: artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So opium poppy on these Roman coins or
Greek coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Cretan poppy goddess,
you know, and you often see again on these
[SPEAKER_00]: reliefs, depictions of opium poppy being
associated with ancient civilizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that in Europe,
even though opium poppy goes back many
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years, the knowledge of the
plant and the medicinal compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, at least was lost from about the
fall of the Roman Empire until the
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody used it or had it anymore in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge was actually maintained in other
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Arab world or in Persia and
brought back to Europe and was brought
[SPEAKER_00]: back by this fellow over here and his name
is Paracelsus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paracelsus was an interesting person,
a Renaissance botanist, alchemist,
[SPEAKER_00]: physician, astrologer and occultist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to put that on my business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was traveling in Arabia and he
brought back a sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's on a magic card or whatever,
you know, it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he brought back a sword and
in the hilt of the sword, there were these
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals that he called the stones of
immortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was opium citrus juice and gold
basically mixed together in some nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from that point,
it became again part of sort of European
[SPEAKER_00]: medical culture during the Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things really got interesting in the
1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 1800s, opium started to be used
much more extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a very dangerous time
apparently to be a child during that part
[SPEAKER_00]: of time in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that from some of these ads
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup for children
teething.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cough killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works like magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone that has had children,
I think those of you that also do would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably agree with me that it's
unfortunate that these products are no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can imagine they were quite
effective at kind of keeping kids quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also, you know, opiates were
actually a very big part of the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Civil War.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an awful lot of addiction
because all soldiers were given a syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: and an opium for their battlefield wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to have these kind of
connections or understanding of a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that has such an ancient origin and how
it's connected to so much of our history
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the trials and tribulations of
pipetting in a lab a lot more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: when you know that you're contributing to
that history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it continues to be a plant that is a
dual use technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use it for both good and bad
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of our technologies are like
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear power, nuclear energy is a good
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can generate electricity or you can do
the wrong things with that same
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the dark side of opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you forget everything else from this
talk, you'll remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you take
morphine that's extracted from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mix it together with an acetyl
donor so you can buy some acetic anhydride
[SPEAKER_00]: that is actually quite difficult to buy
because you can do this with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make morphine diacetate pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And morphine diacetate, of course,
is heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that's happening is that the morphine
is being diacetylated at those two
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxyl functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was back in the early part of the
20th century that heroin was used
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively as a cough suppressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some ads from some old
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem of cough has been solved by
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly it's very effective,
just like codeine is effective as a cough
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was believed that this product,
heroin, was non-addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly that wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within some few years of it being put
on the market, there were half a million
[SPEAKER_00]: opium addicts or heroin addicts in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the 1920s, it was taken off
the market as a cough suppressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, it remains as a problem in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of demonstrates the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is you can make money from
producing heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow opium poppy in
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can transport the opium to
other countries, like Turkey, and add
[SPEAKER_00]: value to it with some degree of
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you get it to Europe
on the streets as heroin, you've added a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of value to the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just gives you some idea of where the
problems are particularly bad in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Russia, and other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really so much in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, it's Vancouver that has the
biggest problem with opiates and heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other places, what I hear is Calgary
is too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody wants to kind of live on the
streets in Calgary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a bad idea, actually,
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my map of what I call the good
guys and the bad guys sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good guys are in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problems in the world are in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest problem, of course,
is Afghanistan for illicit production of
[SPEAKER_00]: opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico and Colombia are counting now for
maybe about 5% of the total illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden triangle over here used to be
more of a problem, a lot less so recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is all these
countries in green that are actually licit
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, licit growers of opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm being a little bit unfair to the
Australians by suggesting that their
[SPEAKER_00]: entire continent is a haven for growing
opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually restricted just to the
island of Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they account for about 50% of the
global licit production right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also other countries, India,
Turkey, and even France, in particular in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, account for a substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: France is about 10% of licit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done in very modern ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a poppy field in Tasmania using
modern farming equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have to, as required by the
United Nations, they have to be allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the harvester comes along,
basically cuts them off with about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters of stem, and then takes that
material, crushes it, and extracts the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical products of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional way of collecting opium
poppy, of course, is to lance the unripe
[SPEAKER_00]: seed capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this latex will exude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the latex, once it dries and oxidizes,
becomes raw opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the content of morphine at this stage
is maybe 1% or under 1% of the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it oxidizes and dries and becomes
this loaf of raw opium, it will rise to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 15% of the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot easier to ship this material
illicitly around as opposed to all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason the UN only allows
India, in fact, to continue in a licit
[SPEAKER_00]: manner to do it this way, because it's
considered to be historical or
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy over here is interesting to
me, because he's doing his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see without the use of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that his job satisfaction
rating is higher than mine ever will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't say much on many days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, connecting to the scientific
history of everything you're going to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of the things that I try to
impress on students is that what we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in the textbook, or what you read
in the literature, and we discuss as now
[SPEAKER_00]: the dogma in the field, somebody had the
gift to get us to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people get us to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very long and slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a timeline of morphine,
for morphine, 200 years, more than 200
[SPEAKER_00]: years of scientific history from Sir
Turner and his first isolation of morphine
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30, 25 years later, the isolation of
codeine by this French chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroin was first synthesized in 1874.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of morphine was not
determined until 1920.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1925, almost 125 years later,
after the compound was isolated,
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure was identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was identified by this fellow here,
Sir Robert Robertson, who's a Nobel Prize
[SPEAKER_00]: winner and also knighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fellow is still alive, Alan
Battersby, brought the biochemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both Sirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Canada is still part of the
Commonwealth, I'm not allowed to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: Sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not a British subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't put my picture over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a bit of the pathway,
maybe later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, lots of interesting and important
discoveries, but a very long period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the period of time that we're
operating in, in about the last quarter of
[SPEAKER_00]: a century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you now how a plant,
how opium poppy, the only plant that can
[SPEAKER_00]: really do it, how it can make morphine
from tyrosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this elegance is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you take a simple amino acid,
two copies of it, and make this molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: that chemists can make, but they really
can't yet make it at yields that are
[SPEAKER_00]: economically competitive with using the
plant as a source of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just start off then with
tyrosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I like to show this,
I don't like to show slides that have lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of structures all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually came up with this some years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stuck in the airport in Boston
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically drew structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else does a biochemistry on your
board?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is an effective way of showing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's tyrosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that happens is it's
decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's 3-hydroxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a neurotransmitter in us,
but it's also a precursor to morphine and
[SPEAKER_00]: opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another molecule of tyrosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, going down this route over
here, you deaminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with the second
intermediate that combines with dopamine
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the first so-called benzyl
isoquinoline alkaloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there they are again, dopamine and
4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 4-HPAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a picked-it-spangler
condensation reaction catalyzed by this
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme norecochlearin synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a benzyl isoquinoline
alkaloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's benzyl isoquinoline because there's
the benzyl and there's the isoquinoline
[SPEAKER_00]: moiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't retain that structural form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backbone structure changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, too, does the decoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you change the backbone
structure of one of these benzyl
[SPEAKER_00]: isoquinoline alkaloids, you have a whole
new molecule that you can decorate with
[SPEAKER_00]: different functionalities and change the
pharmacological properties, biological
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, and so on of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with this
norecochlearin over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 6-omethylated and then
N-methylated, 3-prime hydroxylated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 4-prime omethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's these reactions over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with this key intermediate
called S-reticuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking this morning at breakfast
about chirality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the S-conformer of reticuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is that that wasn't
good enough, apparently, for opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unable to drive it forward to
morphine as the S-conformer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to change to the R-conformer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to change its right hand to its
left hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the left hand to the right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happens next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's S-reticuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you change the chirality of a
chiral center?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove it by oxidizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can put it back by reducing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the specificity of these two
enzymes, which interestingly have fused
[SPEAKER_00]: together into a single enzyme that we call
reticuline epimerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it simply changes the handedness of
the intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at reticuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are actually the same two compounds
over there, just changing the perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: of how we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to look at it this way,
because the next step in the process is to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the structure, the backbone
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's done by this enzyme here,
salutaridine synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's salutaridine, a carbon-carbon
coupling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have now a four-membered ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start to decorate it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is reduced from the keto to the
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hydroxyl group is acetylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that allylic group falls off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with thebain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have your pentacyclic backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, you have now another
somewhat different backbone structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can continue to change the
functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 6-OD methylated, reduced,
3-OD methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very elegant process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of those steps catalyzed by a
different enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every one of those genes encoding
those enzymes is available to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: with, to study, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to talk to you mostly about
today, pick these topics, because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of demonstrating or they're
representative of where a lot of activity
[SPEAKER_00]: is in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's bioengineering in microbial
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of interest,
let's say, some hype, certainly as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: of moving those pathways out of the plant
into a microbial, potentially fermentable
[SPEAKER_00]: system, fermentation system, to displace
the plant as a source of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the first question that
was asked was not, can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, the first question that I think
was asked in about 2015 was, should we be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something we should be doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw articles appearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I question Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I question Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is something that
would be referred to in the US these days
[SPEAKER_00]: as fake news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting to kind of put that
spin on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulate home-brewed opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to start, didn't we go
through all of this with GMOs and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now before the technology really gets
out of the door, there's already sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative spin that's put on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's something that can be
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dangerous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the right thing to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just talk about science and
show you what some of the problems are,
[SPEAKER_00]: what some of the good things actually
about putting these pathways together in a
[SPEAKER_00]: heterologous system is that you,
first of all, learn why it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a new system that you
can ask new questions about and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we discover to try to learn more
about, just academically, what we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about how these pathways actually
function, despite the fact that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the quote unquote genes that are
involved in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first place I'm going to start is
from the group of Christina Smolke at
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they published a paper in Science in
2015 where they assembled the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, they were actually able to
produce the semi-synthetic hydrocodone de
[SPEAKER_00]: novo from a cheap carbon source,
from sugar, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very substantial achievement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yields are telling you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's telling us that we still don't know
certainly everything, maybe not as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to, about how these pathways
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they got were these levels of
Thebanes and hydrocodone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So submicrogram per liter of hydrocodone,
what do you need for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: feasibility to make this fermentation
process competitive with the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: with cultivating the plant, you need above
five grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more than one million times too
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to show this diagram as a way
of reinforcing the problem of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a giant sequoia or a sperm
whale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is about a little less than 10 to
the sixth difference in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find a way of increasing the
yield in these engineered yeast systems by
[SPEAKER_00]: a million times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a substantial difference in amount,
for sure, or size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first story I'm going to tell is
the discovery of a new enzyme that was
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe suspected, but not really sure,
and call it Thebanes synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was published just a few months
ago, earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a number of authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them came from Intrexon that we're
partnered with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in the company and my group
that are particularly instrumental in
[SPEAKER_00]: making the discovery are Shwe and Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we noted, so where this kind of
started, was that this is the pathway that
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's salyteridine reduced to
salyteridinol, acetylated to 7-oacetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was believed that the removal
of that oacetate, that allylic
[SPEAKER_00]: elimination, is spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Intrexon, when we were working with
them, kept referring to carbon loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of carbon that was getting to
this point was much more than the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbon that was going past it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, carbon just doesn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was Jill that was looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we eventually discovered that there
was a byproduct or set of byproducts that
[SPEAKER_00]: was being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this acetyltransferase, so we talked
about acetyltransferases a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this acetyltransferase is not going to
do what we want it to do unless it has
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because when this compound,
once that acetyl group is added,
[SPEAKER_00]: to that hydroxyl there, this allylic
elimination is going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main products, by far,
are going to be these guys over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that water will come
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have the oxidation of one of
these points over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not exactly sure which one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's actually this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could potentially be these other
ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These byproducts don't accumulate in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see them in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we surmised that this is not actually a
spontaneous reaction, that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's preventing this from
happening and instead promoting the
[SPEAKER_00]: allylic elimination, whereby this
hydroxyl, rather than from water,
[SPEAKER_00]: is attacking this carbon over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get thebate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a deduction, I guess,
continuing to look at systems and not
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting thelylic literature as the
truth, but simply as a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly incomplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, what we ended up finding was
it is an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an enzyme that we called thebane
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we found it was to take
latex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assumed that it was going to be in
the latex because as these last steps over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, I haven't told you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these last steps in the pathway,
especially beyond thebane to morphine,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all taking place in that latex,
whereas other steps in the pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earlier steps, are happening in
adjacent cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get into that too much today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided to look in the latex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we took protein extracts from
latex and set up a coupled enzyme assay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we re-added salA-T, either plus or minus
latex protein, and looked for what we
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was no latex protein,
we primarily made what appears to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of these mass to charge 330.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just call it a 330 byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make mostly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we add in the latex protein,
we make mostly thebane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said there's an enzyme in the latex
that is catalyzing that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set about to purify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the literature tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the literature is telling us that
somebody's seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to do something that you
can say, I thought of this myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually seen by Minard-Zenk and
reported a couple of times in the 90s and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mid-2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was saying, look, we see something
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of got the byproduct wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it this asinine derivative,
which is this thing over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part of it, I think, is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, the fact that there was
something in here that was coordinating
[SPEAKER_00]: the formation of thebane as opposed to a
byproduct was seen or suspected
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set about to purify it from the
latex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was done through using some
classic chromatography, protein
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's ammonium sulfate precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hydrophobic interaction,
ion exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this final one over here was gel
filtration chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing now about protein
purification is in the old days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to actually bring the protein to
purity before you could subject it to
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, you can take each one of these
fractions and send it for $200 for mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get back all your proteins that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize how impure everything really
is when you look at things using mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able, with just those three
purification steps, to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate list to just five proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those five proteins were then,
and as you can see, they were all fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were low molecular weight,
so only about 15 kilodaltons, fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expressed all of them in E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the six that we tested,
the first one here that annotated as
[SPEAKER_00]: BETV1, stands for Betula vulgaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a type of so-called PR10
pathogenesis related protein that was
[SPEAKER_00]: first characterized in white birch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy, the heterologous protein,
was doing the same thing that the latex
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was preventing the formation of the
byproducts and instead coordinating the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of theban.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones weren't doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had thebane synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In parallel, you might have seen,
some of you might have seen that the opium
[SPEAKER_00]: poppy genome was reported from Ian
Graham's group just recently in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done the genome ourselves as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a paper that should be published
hopefully sometime early next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our version of the genome, they're
pretty similar, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we detected in
parallel doing the biochemistry was that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a cluster of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember the biosynthesis,
the repi, the reticuline epimerase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the subsequent one, two steps,
saluteridine reductase and saluteridine
[SPEAKER_00]: acetyltransferase, are clustered in the
opium poppy genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that far away, considering the
genome is about 2.7 gigabits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also saw thebane synthase there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know at the time that it was,
but these things, these two approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: converged at almost the same time and gave
us two parallel streams of evidence and
[SPEAKER_00]: paths to discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually recommend both.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're after things, especially when
you get into the realm of, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we try to take is a very multibase
multifaceted approach, everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes to classic biochemistry and
everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two genes for thebane synthase
that we see in the genome, thebane
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually four proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the genes, thebane synthase one,
has a secretion signal on it or a signal
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that the first one is located
outside of the latex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one, the thebane synthase
two, is soluble inside the latex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still don't know exactly what's going
on at the cellular level, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously a lot to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, in addition to that,
there is a cryptic start codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have evidence, both from transcript
size as well as by doing some additional
[SPEAKER_00]: proteomics analysis, that there is a
truncated form that seems to predominate
[SPEAKER_00]: in the latex of both thebane synthase one
and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those truncated forms and terminally
truncated forms are inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, I suspect there's a role for
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another system that we use extensively and
has worked out quite well with Opium Poppy
[SPEAKER_00]: is a functional genomics method that is
based on post-transcriptional gene
[SPEAKER_00]: silencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's virus-induced gene silencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we simply build a construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We infiltrate a young seedling into the
apical meristem at about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the plants are six weeks
old, we harvest them and test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is that the
knockdown of thebane synthase transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: levels is leading to a predicted decrease
in thebane accumulation and an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: salutarydenol levels, which is an
upstream, shortly upstream precursor of
[SPEAKER_00]: thebane synthase in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, we don't see a change in
morphine levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So morphine, as the end of these pathways,
seems to be like a sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just things eventually drain down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're looking at a suppression
technique like this, you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: see a difference in the accumulation of
these major end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see supporting differences in
the accumulation of pathway interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you some physiological evidence
that your genes are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually functioning in the plant
the way that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what was done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We silenced this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see salutarydenol going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see thebane going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, I think, a good piece of
evidence in support of the role of thebane
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the context of yeast engineering,
so how does this help with the low titer
[SPEAKER_00]: of opiate production in yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this was done in collaboration
with Intrexon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting the pathway together and either
not having or adding thebane synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the last one over here is having
everything integrated in the genome of
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, but also adding extra copies of
thebane synthase transiently expressed off
[SPEAKER_00]: of plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that you get a substantial
increase in the yield of thebane compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to a strength brain that is lacking the
thebane synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in this first experiment,
it was about a 25-fold improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So already we've gone up an order of
magnitude in yield in a very much not
[SPEAKER_00]: optimized system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the tools that are going to be
needed to make these technologies work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more of these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic biologists like to use Lego a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have your bucket of Lego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to build the Millennium
Falcon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have all the parts,
maybe it might look kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to be what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need all the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our job is to continue to look for the
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're pretty good at finding
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say a little bit about
localization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see proteomics analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteomics is awesome, I think,
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really superior in a lot of ways to
looking at transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take latex and then we take the
rest of the stem that has been drained of
[SPEAKER_00]: all latex, we can see in our proteomics
analysis that the entire pathway up to
[SPEAKER_00]: cell R is pretty much exclusively
localized in the sieve elements of the
[SPEAKER_00]: floam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this transition zone
between cell R and at least the thebane
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase two isoform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thebane synthase one is not at all
in the latex with that secretion signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thebane synthase two is kind of split
between both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you get to the last
steps from converting thebane to morphine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with everything more or less
occurring in the latex where the alkaloids
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're discussing that a little bit this
morning that there's probably a role for
[SPEAKER_00]: that apple plastic space, the cell wall
space between those two cell types that is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not a ride from one cell type to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly more happening there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not quite quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you one more example,
one more story before I'm done today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's again showing you how you can use
this system, this synthetic biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to refer to it that way,
as a discovery platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just an applied goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds back on itself and it provides a
new way of looking at plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's work that was done in
Christina Smolki's lab and published in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they were feeding a system
working at the end of that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a system where they've got
thebane 6-O-D-methylase, codonone
[SPEAKER_00]: reductase, and codeine O-D-methylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last three steps that are able to
convert thebane to morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they got, they got morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also got this thing called
neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neomorphine doesn't occur in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you what the difference
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's represented here, but I'll show you
in just a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you solve that problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't able to solve the problem,
at least with the available parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking at this enzyme,
codonone reductase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you pretty well the difference
between neomorphine and morphine,
[SPEAKER_00]: or neopene and codeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're isomers of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the only difference
between codeine and neopene is the
[SPEAKER_00]: position of that double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here in neopene, not an improved
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there in codeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here as opposed to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't make these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can detect a tiny bit of
neopene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never can you detect neomorphine in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get to morphine via two routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either go through 6-OD methylation
first, and then reduction, and then 3-OD
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can do 3-OD methylation first,
and then 6-OD methylation second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either way, you get to morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pink root or orange root over here is
the major one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, this step over here
seems to be key, this codonone reductase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the observations that
we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we put codeine into a tube and added
codonone reductase, or core, and NADP
[SPEAKER_00]: plus, so it's a redox reaction,
we could detect the formation of neopene
[SPEAKER_00]: just by incubating it for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a reversible reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, if you added neopene,
does it go back?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go this way, but it won't go
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neopene to neopinone is not a reaction
that is supported by the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if neopene or neomorphine is produced
from neopinone or neomorphanone,
[SPEAKER_00]: so reducing that double bond over there to
an alcohol, these compounds become
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolically trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant isn't doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you build this pathway as it stands
in yeast, the yeast do this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equally, how do you solve that problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, let's look at the
parts we already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what seemed key in this process is
this codonone reductase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an NADPH-dependent reversible
oxidoreductase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few isoforms in any
particular opium poppy plant, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all very similar to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good lesson that when you
look at enzymes and you see that amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence identity, you're probably going
to say, well, they're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be dangerous because they're
not actually the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's first indication that they're
not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the isoforms that we call core B,
which only has a few amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: substitutions compared to these core 1.1
to 4 isoforms, is much better when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: provided with codeine and NADP plus at
producing neopene than the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better at doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much significantly a better enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at its substrate range,
they're actually very similar in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they must be participating somehow
in this reaction over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, OK, well, what's going to
happen if we take core B as opposed to one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other core isoforms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And put it in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the engineers simply not using the
right isoform of this enzyme?
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly there was a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference was a quantitative
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's core 1.3 that's not as good at
producing neopene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's producing equally in
a pathway where we feed the thebane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mimicked what the Smoky lab did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put thebane 6-OD methylase,
core either 1.3 or core B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked for neopene versus codeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we added in the codeine OD methylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked as well for morphine and
neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is, just as they
reported, relatively equal levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: either codeine and neopene or morphine and
neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot lower levels because the CODM
doesn't really work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Core B is doing it much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the scale is about 10 times
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's preferring the formation of
neopene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something else going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to be the isoform of core.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still followed this, thought it was
worthwhile taking a look at every amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid substitution in those isoforms and
asking, what do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work's being published in Plant
Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just point out that we identified
four different residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to point out one in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that position 25 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it either exists as a valine or an
alanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that one, we're able to toggle
between either the superior conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of core B or the inferior conversion
rate of, in this case, core 1.2 or 1.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to toggle between the two of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also saw that the stability of the
enzyme with a single amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: substitution is dramatically changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So core B is much more stable using this
fluorescence thermo shift assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more stable, especially than
core 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.2 was so unstable that we couldn't even
get a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.3 is not as thermo stable as core B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you simply increase the temperature and
melt the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's more stable, it's going to
melt at a higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the basis of that assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something in response to even a single
amino acid substitution is changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the protein and its catalytic
conversion rate efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this into a structural realm,
we looked at a homology model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We modeled this after chalcone reductase,
modeled the enzyme after chalcone
[SPEAKER_00]: reductase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the model showed us was that this
either valine or alanine, that one amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, is interacting sterically with the
cofactor, with NADP plus or NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this supports the mutagenesis work,
gives us a lot of information about an
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't tell us why plants don't
make neoprene or neomorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you follow your lines of inquiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collaborating with a structural
biologist in Calgary, Ken Ng.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've determined the structure based
on the crystal of chalcone reductase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it's a dimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reported in the literature when it
was first purified that it was a monomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure shows us that it's a
homodimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that change the way that we look
at the function of this enzyme?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly dimerization is going to
change a lot of the enzymatic features of
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that affect engineering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategies and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the more you know, the easier
things are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to go to my last slide
and just show you that we do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some data in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use our solution, I keep it quiet
because the lawyers told me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be shortly that it'll be published,
hopefully early next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we can do the same
thing that we did with t-bane synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By understanding how things actually work,
we can change in yeast the ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily neoprene and very little codeine
without our solution to primarily codeine
[SPEAKER_00]: and virtually no neoprene with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this is how the plant is doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it's a solution from an
engineering point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's applicable not only to the
formation of natural compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to the formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hydrocodone over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you can read about this hopefully
in about two months and find out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the summary slide of basically
how we approach our basic science and
[SPEAKER_00]: seamlessly, more or less, integrate it
with the translational work and the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know there's lots of missing parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the plant to find those missing
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working without plants and
you're trying to engineer plant pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to get very
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can assemble them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the assembly to do your
synthetic biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the synthetic biology feeds back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us what's not working,
tells us where the bottlenecks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we identify a bottleneck,
now we have a system that we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far we've I think done quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields are going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trajectory looks good in terms of
hopefully at some point getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially relevant yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for this system, but you could
replace this plant with anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the big one right now in Canada
is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to say the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm going to stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that was informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one already.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of the pathway is extracellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products have to be secreted to the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't accumulate in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be no storage
capability within yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes should be localized to the
compartments that any signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: information on the enzyme or lack thereof
is directing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're P450s, they're membrane
bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to be on the ER in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are soluble in the plant cells,
then they're going to be soluble in yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately the products need to be
exported to the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere to accumulate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking of this in the elements of
the testifiers, where we have sort of a
piece of a protoplasmic living space.
And then you set it into something that's
not so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: At what point did the yeast kick out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one of the problems that
you can imagine is going to afflict any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these engineered systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that these are kind of xenobiotic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeast doesn't want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathway intermediates are being kicked
out as well, which if you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to a specific end product, you want to
keep those intermediates inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there metabolic channels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these enzymes in the plant interact
with one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we missing helper proteins,
components that are helping to form those
[SPEAKER_00]: channels?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does a plant deal with many of these
intermediates that are very hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very water soluble?
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent are lipophilic parts of a
plant cell involved in biosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all unknown questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But questions that, as I say, are emerging
as important because there is a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: goal to try to achieve and problems to
solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually don't know all that much
more than the model that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where these enzymes are found in
two different cells in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, there's a handoff between
those two cells of some intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably, I think the intermediate is
the acetylated, the 7-O acetate of
[SPEAKER_00]: seluteridinol, because an acetate would be
much more soluble and easy to transport
[SPEAKER_00]: from one cell to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thebane is highly insoluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to get it dissolved,
even to do an assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not so sure that that's a good
candidate for translocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these questions fit into the
efforts to try to do it all in a single
[SPEAKER_00]: compartment, in a single cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not just a question of having it
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it work well enough,
above a threshold, to produce levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: make it economically competitive with
simply throwing seeds in the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, I enjoyed your seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zenk, I think in a report that I read at a
conference, said the morphine was found in
[SPEAKER_02]: a frog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is really, has morphine
been found in any other organism?
[SPEAKER_00]: In me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last bits of research that he
was doing, that was a major focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was demonstrating that in human
tissue that you can detect small
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathway, my understanding is that the
proposed pathway in mammals and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: other animals is chemically similar,
but biochemically completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't go to the human genome and
find any of these plant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might find certain things that
are similar, but they're not functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't participate in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still kind of paradoxical in the
sense that there seems to be pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that we make our own morphine and
maybe that's why we have such a good
[SPEAKER_00]: opiate receptor or set of receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still not very good
biochemical support in terms of how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done, how it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you looked into the evolutionary
history and purpose of morphine within the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant itself and used this to sort of give
you insight on the pathway further?
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought about that, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought we had an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were talking about this idea of
where do enzymes come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have a pool of genes that can
be recruited into these specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we thought we had it solved a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually some of the work that
Scott Farrow did when he was in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was looking at the fact that these
enzymes, the OD methylases, so the third
[SPEAKER_00]: to last and the last step in morphine
biosynthesis, those OD methylases will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually OD methylate a wide collection of
benzyl isoquinol and alkaloids with very
[SPEAKER_00]: different structures than morphine
encoding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we thought was, oh, that's the
function that's being selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a byproduct, but a
parallel thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unimportant to the plant from a
selection point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Scott actually took, so we thought,
well, if that's the case, then we should
[SPEAKER_00]: find OD methylation activity for orthologs
in plants that are related to opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at dozens of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two OD methylases are the only
two that showed any activity with these
[SPEAKER_00]: benzyl isoquinol and alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of threw that idea out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still kind of think that we're
always looking at this from the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view of morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at its pharmacological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be a deliberate selection in
the plant on the basis of that
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacological property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can just be totally misleading
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some other compounds where
morphine is just a happy circumstance of
[SPEAKER_00]: some other metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking in the wrong place for
the evolutionary connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there isn't a good answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why does one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'd like to tell Health Canada
this, because I like to cause them fits
[SPEAKER_00]: about how terrible controlled substances
regulations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's the same in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started looking at other related plants
to opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not supposed to have morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about half of them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels are much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like to tell them is that a lot
of plants are on the verge of being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to make morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent do you need substitutions
in order to turn enzymes, the key ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are missing in other plants that
don't make opium poppy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into enzymes that can actually participate
in that pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many substitutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at it that way,
I think, well, this could also just be
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're in the right place at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also been breeding this plant
for 6,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually something we see in
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome of opium poppy is a mess,
just like most domesticated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's extensive copy number variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of deleted bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then do you look at any ancient DNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find a backer, we need a
rich person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's my dream one day,
is connect with anthropologists and have
[SPEAKER_00]: this big international team go out and
find opium poppy material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ancient material and just sequence it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it against the reference genome and
see if you can trace how this plant kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of moved around throughout history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might even be a science paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do the yeast thing first and get
rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or take up a collection, if you all want
to pitch in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have for some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's lunch for graduate students
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please join in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please join in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
