[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm here today to talk about some
recent work I've been working on in
[SPEAKER_00]: epistasis in allopolyploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in your typical hybrid production,
at some point you have some alleles that
[SPEAKER_00]: are floating around in an open-pollinated
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point, either
intentionally or unintentionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get separated from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with different heterotic
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when those heterotic groups are
brought back together, you end up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've established heterozygosity at
essentially all loci in the genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now you've got these allelic
interactions, which we think is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is important for hybrid vigor in
these progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to think of allopolyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because you start
off with a common ancestor that has some
[SPEAKER_00]: set of alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through gene mutation and
evolution, this thing speciates into two
[SPEAKER_00]: species, A and B, that are still more or
less related to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hybridization between them becomes
relatively rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it does happen, you bring both of
these genomes together into the same
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've established, essentially,
heterozygosity at all of the loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so based on this, maybe we have some
homeoallelic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and these may be what's important for
why a lot of our crop species,
[SPEAKER_00]: including wheat, are so widely adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a brief reminder of epistasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epistasis is the interaction between two
loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these loci can have I'm showing two
loci B and C here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing for the inbred case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of allopolyploids are
instantly sexually isolated, they usually
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot continue to outcross after that
hybridization event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to self in order to continue
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's cool about that is they end up
fixing all of these allelic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you maintain allelic diversity across
your subgenomes while preserving your
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so you can have two loci B and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps these are homeoallelic,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is on the A genome, one on the B
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's various models we could have
for how these genes might have an
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A will be the effect on the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and you have the classic
multiplicative interaction, which you see
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also have a duplicate factor
interaction, which is analogous to two
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that have essentially the same
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a functional copy of
one or the other, you get the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, we have complementarity,
which is like two genes in a pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need two functional alleles in order
to get the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll notice that in inbreds,
and this isn't true for hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I'm sorry, heterozygous populations,
you'll notice that the complementary is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially just the mathematical inverse
of the duplicate factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm not going to talk about the
complementary anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will revisit the duplicate factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to propose another way
to look at this epistatic problem that is
[SPEAKER_00]: related to subfunctionalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the idea is there is some haplotype
A in the ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then through time and mutation,
you get a change in this allele A,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can allow these alleles to diverge
in their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to, but you can allow them
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then when you bring them back into
the same organism, like in an
[SPEAKER_00]: allopolyploid, you essentially get the sum
of their effects times some divergence
[SPEAKER_00]: from their initial value.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the idea here is you'll notice that
when d equals 1, they have diverged such
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have completely new function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they no longer perform the same
function within the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when d equals 0.5, and these are
equal, they essentially have not diverged
[SPEAKER_00]: in their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and everything in between and passed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my subfunctionalization epistatic model
actually covers subfunctionalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when d is in between 0.5 and 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows for a completely additive
model, as well as for something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like over dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When d is greater than 1, there's
something about having two things is
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than the sum of its parts,
which you could come up with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: fun biological reasons for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, when d equals 0,
this ends up being the inverse of the
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplicative, which is kind of
complicated, and I'm not going to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so from an ordinary least squares
perspective, you can think of this problem
[SPEAKER_00]: as you have an additive effect for the B
allele, an additive effect for the C
[SPEAKER_00]: allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then an interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and what's cool is in an inbreds,
if they're truly inbred, you can code all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the markers as 0 or 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you either have the B allele or you
don't have the B allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the interaction is just the
product of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I've got like, so this I'm
showing like marker scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've also got, this is just
like a design matrix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this would be the additive effect
of B, C, and then the interaction effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is basically what you're going
to get as beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's nice about this is because you
only have 0's and 1's, this nasty matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: algebra looking thing here really
simplifies into a much more simple
[SPEAKER_00]: equation that is just a function of allele
frequencies, which is super neat and is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice property of having 0's and 1's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we can get the expected value
of y's here, we can actually figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what the expected answer to these betas
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that's going to do is it's going
to allow me to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship is between the estimated
additive effects and their interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so there's some math that goes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see that here for the
multiplicative epistatic model,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the additive effects will end
up being 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interaction is non-zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the duplicate factor, we have the
additive effects being negatively related
[SPEAKER_00]: to the interaction effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, in my subfunctionalization,
or what I'm calling subfunctionalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: when d is less than 1, there will be a
negative relationship between the additive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when d is greater than 1, there will
be a positive relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: additive effects and the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, if you want to test all
pairs of epistatic loci, you run into a
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple testing problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, even with a modest amount of
markers, like 6,000, you have about 17
[SPEAKER_00]: million tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I can do is we can
use some properties of linear mixed models
[SPEAKER_00]: and epistatic genetic covariances.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this looks disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing is you have
some genetic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have an epistatic effect
that is simply the Hadamard product of two
[SPEAKER_00]: separate genetic covariance matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the 0, 1 coding, this all works
out very beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it drops out such that this Hadamard
product is exactly equal to the covariance
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would calculate based on all of
these pairwise interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so then you can estimate a genetic
effect for their interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can estimate a genetic effect for
the additive portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also transform these back into
marker effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really ugly because you have to
make a matrix of this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't actually done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm utilizing this property to keep
from having to deal with 17 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so then I'm just going to look at
what the relative relationship between the
additive effects is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the additive effects is in the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is the classic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think of a phenotype as some function
of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is I want to find
groups of markers that make sense to test
[SPEAKER_00]: for epistatic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want a relatively small number of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't have 17 million of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I might pick, say,
two homeologous chromosome arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short arm of chromosome 1A and the
short arm of chromosome 1B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can pluck those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can model the rest of the genomic
effect, account for it, while I look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the additive effect of each chromosome
arm, as well as their interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use a series of nested
likelihood ratio tests to test whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not these additive effects have a non-zero
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to test whether or not the
interaction has a non-zero variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I establish that both of those
things are true, then I can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between their additive
effects and their interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so I did actually test this on
real data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also simulated it, but I think the
real data example is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so relatively larger population,
1,200 lines, 7,500 observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have about 6,000 markers that have
been pretty heavily filtered for
[SPEAKER_00]: missingness and minor allele frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I impute this, and then I set the
heterozygous calls to the major allele
[SPEAKER_00]: because I need everything to be zeros and
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't have a heterozygous call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially these small 2% of
heterozygous calls that I get,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just set to the major allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then importantly, because of this
epistatic model I was showing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively I've made the assumption that
being functional allows you to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the value, say, yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I have to phase the markers by
their effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just run a GWAS, and then I just
have all of the positive effect alleles be
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1 and the negative effect alleles be a
0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the result from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I have out of 42 homeologies,
homologous chromosome arm pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test all 42 of them, and I find eight of
them that have significant additive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects as well as significant
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice I find, so here I've
colored these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red indicates that there was a
negative relationship between the additive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue indicates a positive relationship
between the additive effect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue corresponds like D greater
than 1, or like that over dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red corresponds to more of a
sub-functionalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these black ones are a couple
that I found that have significant
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction effects but don't necessarily
have a significant correlation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: additive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what's going on with those
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll notice that I have tested these
at an alpha of 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, this has not been corrected
for multiple testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do, I basically lose these
things, which isn't super surprising but
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of frustrating for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These multi-kernel models get kind of
difficult to fit because I've got this big
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's having an effect on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking one tiny little piece out
of it, and I'm setting it aside,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm asking, what is the variance that
you explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what is the variance that your
interactions explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I'm just getting so small
that it's hard to find really significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did do this for actually all 861
chromosome pairs, regardless of whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not they are homeologous or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do find signal all over the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly within the B genome,
there's a lot of signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of signal between the A
and the B, but not necessarily on what we
[SPEAKER_00]: believe are homeologous regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and this is at a bonferronia of
0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to the minus 5, roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bulk of them tend to show
something that looks like this
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-functionality, which I guess I haven't
really had enough chance to digest these
[SPEAKER_00]: results from why I would expect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in conclusion, epistatic
interactions do appear important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm finding them mostly within and
across the A and B genomes and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily homeologous regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep one of those homeologous
interactions, but one out of 20 or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was is arguably maybe not the
most significant thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be because the signal is being
drowned by having multiple interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's such large pieces of
chromatin I'm testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way I've been thinking about
circumventing this moving forward is now
[SPEAKER_00]: that we actually have a reference genome,
I plan on scanning the genome for
[SPEAKER_00]: triplicate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you find one gene in the A
genome, one in the B, one in the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the marker that's
nearest those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically, I would just use the
multiplicative products of those markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I would be drastically
reducing the number of interactions I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I may pick up a lot more
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd just like to thank my
committee, the Yannick Soros Group and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Small Grains field crew, who which I could
not have all of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're still actually making,
see, this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already done the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already asked whether or not their
additive is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have to take that into
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a correction for the
fact that you said, OK, now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that their additive is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just condition on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not worry about it.
There's also
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could speculate a lot on this,
too, especially since there's been there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also been translocations that have
happened since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have not been specifically
careful about saying, OK, this region is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly synthetic to that region on these
three genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically made the assumption that
there's more or less gene synteny from
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome to chromosome, which is
arguably a pretty rough assumption to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to do this genome scan to
see if I could even see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's possible that you could
have ancient duplications doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect them to have diverged to
the point of being either completely
[SPEAKER_00]: additive or fixed by that point,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'm concerned that part of the
reason I don't see this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: because wheat is too old of a hybrid,
even though it's not that old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last hybridization event happened
like 9,000, 10,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you wanted to ask that
question, the cool way to do it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to do exome capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could grab all of those
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that my markers aren't in
genes, necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wheat has really large regions of
chromatin or LD blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A better response to your question would
be, yes, you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then how do you decide whether or not
they're different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're certainly not identical by
descent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might be identical by state in
their amino acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without sequencing like the
transcriptome, you wouldn't even have a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful idea of how close they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's thank Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
