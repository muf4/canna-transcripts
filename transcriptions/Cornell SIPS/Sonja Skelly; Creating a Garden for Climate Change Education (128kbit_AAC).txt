[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to share this
project with you all today, especially as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with plant scientists and
horticulturists and experts in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and high tunnels, as you'll see why that's
important, to use those things to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: educate about climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we're hoping our goal is
to have a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to do something a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the lucky one who gets to speak to
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have two collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have lots of collaborators on
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to highlight them all at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a few of us here at the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But key to this effort has been Chris
Ween, who has now left the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we keep trying to draw him back in as
often as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Josh Sarah from Landscape
Architecture, who the three of us served
[SPEAKER_00]: as the principal investigators when we
started putting this project together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Josh and I are continuing to work on
this with a host of other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I tell you about the garden
itself, I wanted to give you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: background, at least from where we were
working from, so you have some context for
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were coming from and what we were
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think most of us are aware,
climate change is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a slide that I pulled from
NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was initially preparing this,
when they were saying that January has
[SPEAKER_00]: broken all records, that has quickly been
eclipsed by all the records set in
[SPEAKER_00]: February for being the hottest,
let me make sure I say this right,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most anomalous warm month ever
recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So February broke all of January's
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that this is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of scientists on campus
who are working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we also know is that as the
public, there's a disconnect between the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that we have about climate
change and our willingness to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in talking about, in looking at what
other gardens were doing, so plantations
[SPEAKER_00]: as the public garden of Cornell,
we wanted to know what was happening out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of work has been done on plant
conservation efforts, specifically in
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at how we conserve plants,
either in-situ or ex-situ programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the recent ones that have just been
released is the New England Wildflower
[SPEAKER_00]: Society recently put out this
habitat-based approach when they profiled
[SPEAKER_00]: their five key habitats for the Northeast
region and discussed the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that are facing each habitat and
discussing the impacts that stressors such
[SPEAKER_00]: as climate change are likely to have on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: An international organization called
Botanic Gardens Conservation International
[SPEAKER_00]: is looking at climate change on plants,
the impacts on plants and their
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, or at the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this report lists how the impact of
climate change will affect animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: will affect humans who depend on them,
but also provides some recommendations for
[SPEAKER_00]: how to stave off extinction or to work
toward these issues that are being faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most predominant way that
public gardens are educating about climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change is through phenology studies and
looking at things like Project Bud Burst
[SPEAKER_00]: or Project Bud Break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing it in a few ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is by using their own plant records,
which public gardens are well known to
[SPEAKER_00]: have very detailed and accurate records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of gardens are using these
records to record the times of first leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: out and the first bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also now looking at installing
plants on what's called a phenological
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring garden and looking specifically
at specific kinds of plants and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're flowering at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're also involved in citizen
science efforts which train volunteers,
[SPEAKER_00]: staff, school children to go out and
record the date of first bud break or leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: break within their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other way that we're familiar
with are ways in which gardens are
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting climate change and their
outreach programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of interpretation, the American
Public Garden Association is working to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a set of templates that are based
on the most recent climate science about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change, providing information that
gardens can develop their own interpretive
[SPEAKER_00]: tools for, or there are outreach programs
such as the Community Climate Action
[SPEAKER_00]: Program at the Chicago Botanic Garden
which takes a slightly different approach
[SPEAKER_00]: and goes out into communities and works
with groups that are traditionally not
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in the climate change
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go into the community,
they work with these community groups on
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that they're facing that are
related or are the result of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and look to find assets that this
community can use to solve problems and so
[SPEAKER_00]: are really taking it at a community level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are educational outreach
efforts such as the Fairchild Challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: which is out of the Fairchild Tropical
Botanic Garden in Miami that is a K
[SPEAKER_00]: through 12 environmental science
competition and many of the topics that
[SPEAKER_00]: are addressed in that through art and
literature, through debates, are focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in looking and trying to find out if
anybody else is doing something called a
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change garden, we came across this
effort at Syracuse University and in 2014
[SPEAKER_00]: they installed what they're calling a
climate change garden that will track how
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will adapt to global warming and
they planted 33 different species of trees
[SPEAKER_00]: and shrubs, some of which are adapted to
central New York and some which are
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to warmer regions, and they will
be monitoring these to see if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: any changes in health and the vitality of
these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll also share that the executive
director of the American Public Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: Association saw what we see and feel and
that is that public gardens really are
[SPEAKER_00]: uniquely positioned to be, as he says,
the place to learn about and experience
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change and that public gardens are
places where visitors can make local
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to the global issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was something that really is
something that we were very interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we appreciated the phenological
studies and the phenological monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and the outreach efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we're trying to partner with the
Chicago Botanic Garden on that
[SPEAKER_00]: community-based asset approach that I
described, but what we were looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: was something that was demonstrative,
that was experiential, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: interactive, that was compelling to
visitors, that somehow gave them a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of what climate change is expected to do
and what impacts it would have locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in looking at this and in going
through the project for a couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we recently came across a paper from
Perspectives on Psychological Science that
[SPEAKER_00]: was written to address how we can improve
public engagement in policy efforts toward
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just briefly, I thought I would share
some of these because they are in line
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the things that we're trying
to do and some of the goals that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that we value experience over
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the climate science that's put
out there, a lot of what's seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: media, a lot of the articles that are
written or even interpretation we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing at public gardens is very
analytical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting lots of statistics out,
but as individuals, we do have an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical side of our brain, but we also,
we react to our gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there was an opportunity to
really highlight relevant experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: how people may be experiencing current
effects of climate change or are seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns to build on that, the other one
that really jumped out was this out of
[SPEAKER_00]: sight, out of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we may have all experienced
this in this, that climate change is some
[SPEAKER_00]: future phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen in our lifetime,
and it's happening across the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else other than ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we make that, how do we
change that perception?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of their recommendations is to
emphasize what's happening now and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at a local and regional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, which I didn't highlight
here, but I think is really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this idea of how we are motivated to
act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are either motivated at an
extrinsic level, you know, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot there waiting for us, or from an
intrinsic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what their study found is that there
is this deeply held motivation that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have intrinsically to want to make the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they recommended tapping into that
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't quite figure that one out,
but we'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do was come up with
what we are calling a creative experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a true experiment in the way
that we're all used to thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: control and experimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we wanted to figure out if we
could create a garden or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience within a garden that would
inform visitors about climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: would physically demonstrate what we might
expect in some future, not too distant
[SPEAKER_00]: future, that would use plants as a lens to
communicate what these impacts are likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gave visitors some way to really
experience this and even to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: these changes that we are seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've came up with a way to do this,
and our approach was to look at it from an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental control standpoint,
a plant response standpoint, a visitor
[SPEAKER_00]: response standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental controls,
this is where Chris Wien came in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and his love of high tunnels, he said,
you guys at Plantations need a high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, he was advocating not just for
us to have a high tunnel, but that he felt
[SPEAKER_00]: that it could be a tool to approximate
some of the predicted future climate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as horticulturists and as
gardeners and at a public garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really wanted to have plants as the
lens and wanted to see if we could find
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that would show effects of
temperature and precipitation and could be
[SPEAKER_00]: good communicators of what we were
expecting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, we're doing this so
that we can have some impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors that come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a spectrum of what we want to do
from goals, it's one, increasing their
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of and concern of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's always about some intent
to act, some making that world a better
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my colleagues would agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enter the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we received an initial grant from the
Towards Sustainability Foundation to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel and install it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 24 by 20 and 12 feet high tunnel
covered with a polyethylene film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there are lots of other devices,
some far more expensive that can
[SPEAKER_00]: approximate more accurately the effects of
climate change, we were drawn to the high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel because it's relatively
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can regulate temperature because of
the radiation and the ventilation and that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could also control irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to constructing the high
tunnel, we also constructed 12 raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds, four by six beds, both outside the
garden, outside the high tunnel and inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we installed temperature sensors,
both inside and outside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using an onset computer model,
U30 Hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take both the air temperature as well
as soil temperature and measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: active radiation during the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we set out to do was to
create what we call the garden of today in
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would experience the temperatures
and the precipitation and the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: changes of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted to approximate some
future climate and we selected the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is when we invited Jonathan Schulte,
who is a professor of communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with us on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying, you know, you really need
to put a date on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's that future, distant
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to happen date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that date of 2050 really gives us
something not too distant that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: 34 years is not that far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, many of us will still be alive
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can imagine our children in this
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason is that we are using the
NYSERDA climate report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within this report, which is full of
lots of good information, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, there are climate models and
they're based on the 2020s, the 2050s,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2080s and the 2100s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time frame gave us a clear model
to work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the report that I just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an assessment that provides
information on climate change impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: specific for New York State and even more
specifically for various regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are here in region three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are climate projections for
temperature, precipitation, sea level
[SPEAKER_00]: rise, heat waves, cold events,
intense precipitation, extreme events and
[SPEAKER_00]: storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were using this report to get at
those projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with temperature, that for the
2050s, we are expected to see an average
[SPEAKER_00]: annual increase of between 4.4 and 6.3
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are expected to be an increase in
days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 38 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have a greater
frequency and duration of heat waves,
[SPEAKER_00]: so three to six consecutive days over 90
degrees or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're expected to have five or three
to six of those heat wave durations
[SPEAKER_00]: lasting five or more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our annual precipitation is
expected to increase by four to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this increase right now is looking at
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That increase will happen primarily over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually in this late summer in
the fall, there'll be a decrease in that
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also expected to have some
increase in frequency and intensity and
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of extreme precipitation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at all those projections,
we've installed the garden in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the garden itself,
just to give you a sense of where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located in the Botanic Garden Bowl of
Plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in what's known as the Pounder
Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sits within the southeast corner of
that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent the first year primarily
installing the high tunnel, as I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you, and getting the beds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did minimal interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having lots of discussions about
how we would interpret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in talking about the plants,
we were very ambitious in this first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we selected six different categories
of plants to display and walk you through
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first one that's pictured here is a
temperate species that would have an
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and abbreviated growth period in
the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second bed was landscape plants that
would grow well in the high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not be hardy outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a southern girl, I was really
excited to see the slacostromias in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then having more temperate species
that would have an earlier and abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: growth period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual species of tropical origin that
would grow well outside, but not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it would grow well in the high tunnel,
but not so well outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were things like okra,
peanuts, cotton, malabar spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did varieties of peppers,
several different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tender perennials, things that
would grow well in the tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not so well outside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an interesting, watching how
people interacted with these plants was
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this garden, this particular bed,
a couple of anecdotes, both for myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the student who's working in there,
is that when people saw this, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow this here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, when we're talking about plants
as messengers a little bit later,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always come back to this one,
being clear about what kind of message
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to convey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the interpretation we had
for the first year, which was very simply
[SPEAKER_00]: a welcome sign, mentioned a little bit
about the garden and what we were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a brochure with a detachable
survey and invited folks to walk around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our idea is that they would interact with
the garden and tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they felt about the quality of the
plants inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flip of this had an inside the
tunnel and asked them to rank and then had
[SPEAKER_00]: these directed questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put out 100 surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all gone at the end of the
season, but we only received nine of these
[SPEAKER_00]: detachable surveys back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, we saw that these
open-ended questions didn't work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People did tend to fill in the quality,
but not so much on the open-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had several interns work in
the garden and they documented their
[SPEAKER_00]: observations both about the garden,
but also about the visitors that were
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the kinds of questions and
interactions that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a couple of lessons that we
learned from this first year that we took
[SPEAKER_00]: on to for this last year in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I mentioned, it was,
we really were getting started planting
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden, seeing how well it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did see is that in the high
tunnel, we were able to get, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it was not severely restricted in terms of
the ventilation, we were able to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the temperature higher inside
the tunnel than outside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also observed differences in plant
growth inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just mentioned to you about the
visitor survey results or lack thereof
[SPEAKER_00]: that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, probably one of the most
striking things was how people used the
[SPEAKER_00]: site or didn't use the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where that sign was,
the interpretive sign, and with the
[SPEAKER_00]: brochure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to get into the garden,
you either had to go up this step,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk around this planting of corn,
and bypass the high tunnel, which
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wants to walk into it first,
or you had to enter from some other part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the garden or jump up off this probably
two feet retaining wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't really able to direct the
experience and how people moved through
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't a lot of signage that
said, this was the garden of today,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the garden of 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enter what we did last year,
which was to improve the visitor
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and go into that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fairly accurate rendition
that was done by Maria Jacques Barre,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is a student in landscape
architecture, to really help us redesign
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience so that visitors understood
what they were coming into and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the exception of this arch,
which isn't in the garden, we did install
[SPEAKER_00]: some new steps so people could come
directly into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we displayed a sequence of
interpretive messages along with what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call focused information tags in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you a sense of what that
looked like, here at this first space,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what it looked like as you
walked up to it, we tell you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the garden itself, a little bit more
about some of the science behind it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're hoping to do in the garden,
very clearly say, this is the garden of
[SPEAKER_00]: today, and this is the garden of 2050,
and give you some of those graphics that
[SPEAKER_00]: another student in landscape architecture
helped us develop to convey some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information, which if you read it in a
paragraph, it's pretty hefty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she worked really hard with us to
graphically depict that so it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: visible, especially when you look at some
of the interpretation, which studies say
[SPEAKER_00]: most people spend maybe two minutes,
if we're lucky, looking at a sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then before they enter the garden,
we wanted to stop them and tell them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about the plants that they
would be seeing in these gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mentioned we were very
ambitious about the plants that we had in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first year's garden, what we wanted to
do was one of the things that our students
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in her observations is that it was
very daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lots of plants to look at,
and the messages in doing a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between six different categories and what
ended up being 36 different plants was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we narrowed it down to two categories
of plants, nectar resource plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables and grains, and then we tell
them a little bit about why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in looking at these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tell them a little bit about
them, but there are these what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: them focused information tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to call out something or draw
their attention to something or get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they get to the back of the
garden before they enter into the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: of the future, we wanted to give them a
chance to record some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before they enter into the high
tunnel, we tell them about what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: about to enter into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're using some of those
graphics that were developed to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does the garden of 2050 look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you expected to encounter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this chalkboard where we
can call attention to what is happening
[SPEAKER_00]: within the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at this particular time,
we were initiating a heat wave,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to initiate a heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to follow the projections and had
six heat waves over the course of the 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, as they exit the garden,
we wanted to give them another opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to share their observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give them some way to learn about
more about the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we gave them a takeaway brochure,
which is based in large part on the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that David Wolf did in his chapter about
gardening sustainably in a changing
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was very generous with this work to
give our visitors something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: could leave with that gave them some tools
to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that we tried to do in
addition to improving the visitor
[SPEAKER_00]: experience was really to tune the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we didn't get quite the
increase that we were looking for in 2014
[SPEAKER_00]: that was consistent with the projections
for 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really wanted to figure out how we
could tune that tunnel to get the average
[SPEAKER_00]: annual temperature increase of 4.4 to 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, we were manually rolling up the
sides of that high tunnel to restrict the
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation to get the temperatures up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, we installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see there's the manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have to do it a couple of
times a day, it's not hard, but it gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we automated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit about that
automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we really wanted to figure out
and test and identify plants that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: our messengers and whether they were
susceptible to the impacts that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing with climate change or if they were
showing resilience to them and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: how they would be affected by the
temperature and eventually precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they had accelerated growth or
senescence, bloom time differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress-related diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could we interpret those in a way that
our visitors would understand and that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could attribute to temperature or change
in precipitation or temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, we focused on grain
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to do is tie this idea
of our food plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, we know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases, we don't know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we would start with grains
since so much of our diet is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would have other plants that
are common in home gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these beds here, we have barley,
wheat, and oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know about, at least with
wheat, is that it's a short-lived annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under increased temperatures,
it could grow faster and have reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we could
interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, last year, we had some
disease that affected the wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know, again, why this was the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that we're trying to
tune in terms of understanding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tried beans in the garden,
both inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, we went through six
heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when these beans were setting their
flowers, we had one of those heat waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we ended up seeing was a split
set of the beans, which we have beans of
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at higher temperatures,
the beans will drop their flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which for a home gardener may not be a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a production standpoint,
could have a real impact in having fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both the grains and the beans were
done relatively early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gave us an opportunity to try out
another set of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried out lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had different germination rates
inside and outside of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're recording those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a different set of varieties
of lettuce that were planted in the bean
[SPEAKER_00]: beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the other final food crop,
we had peppers and wanted to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of differences we could expect
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other set of plants were our
nectar resource plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this by early blooming flowers,
late blooming summer flowers, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: fall blooming flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the early summer flowering
plants, things like Iris versicolor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the menorah, the pensionum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wanted to see what kind of impact that
they would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was another way that instead of
just pointing out things, we were asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for visitors to comment on their
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the exception of the first set of
checks in both of these, which is us
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on there so people know what to
do, you can see that our visitors
[SPEAKER_00]: generally recognize the difference between
what they were seeing inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the late summer
flowering plants, so two different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of asclepias and pycanthemum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, trying to draw attention to
what we were seeing and help our visitors
[SPEAKER_00]: see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're asking them to count the
flowers inside and outside, see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: can notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we had the fall blooming
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had Soledago, Cleoni, Anaconda,
Wood Aster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, excuse me, we had this
poor Cleoni that was being over-competed
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Soledago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we simply say here, this Cleoni is
having a hard time competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant communities in the future may change
as some plants better adapt to new
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that we did last year
was to work with Jonathan Schult from
[SPEAKER_00]: communication to really get serious about
a visitor survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw limitations of our initial one,
and we wanted his help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his work is working with public
perception of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a statistician, and so lots of
good things to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did with this visitor survey
is that we asked some general questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about knowledge, people's knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their concern, their opinion about climate
change and how it's caused, when the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes will occur, and the likelihood
that they would take some action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these questions are based on
polling data, whether it's Gallup poll or
[SPEAKER_00]: ABC News polling, Times polling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is so that we can use our results
and we can compare them to what's being
[SPEAKER_00]: polled on a national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then asked some very specific
questions to our project things about what
[SPEAKER_00]: impact we would have on local climate
plant communities, those nectar resource
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the local crops, what people could
expect in 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they recognizing the changes that
we're likely to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to happen specifically in
central New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to understand if they felt like
they had access to reliable information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if they were seeing any
differences between the plants inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, and whether the signs that we had
up were of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our initial results, just saying
that this was a pilot test, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: launch it until the very end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had 43 participants, and most of
those were students from communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they had incentive to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had tour takers, folks who came on
tours of plantations who were willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with only having 43 participants,
we don't have, as John says, not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical power to say anything,
but he was, and these are his words,
[SPEAKER_00]: initial indications are that there's
something detectable happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was very encouraged by what he was
seeing, but he wouldn't say anything more
[SPEAKER_00]: than that for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's on board for us to do this next
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about that and what we plan to
do, we are, again, working on refining
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really changing the plant
material very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to refine that garden experience
in looking at the interpretation and how
[SPEAKER_00]: people navigate through the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to see if we can fine tune the
tunnel and whether we can eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the garden and the tunnel,
one of the things that Josh was suggesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were successful in doing was
partnering with a professor from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Biological and Environmental
Engineering, Pete Marchetto, who is
[SPEAKER_00]: working with us to build, as best I can
call it, a widget that will take the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature from that computer sensor,
the weather station, and monitor what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening outside, know what we want to
have happen inside in terms of average
[SPEAKER_00]: annual increase, but also these heat
waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will take all that information,
and it will do what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's told us that we can even have a
heat wave button on this so that the sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tunnel and the vents and the doors
can be automated to ventilate the tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the kind of controls that we're
looking for to meet the projections that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're hoping to replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we're trying to do is,
once we get that temperature dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to figure out how we can start to
include precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we've only been working under
the one variable of temperature and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can raise the temperature in the
high tunnel enough to meet what's being
[SPEAKER_00]: projected and to see what kind of impacts
that will have on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that precipitation is going to
be a big issue for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're talking about how we might do
that with soil, moisture sensors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with hand watering and drip
irrigation and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to get the plants right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to, as I said, use plants as
messengers, and we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that we're using will have some
effect and that that effect is the result
[SPEAKER_00]: of either temperature or precipitation,
and that they have the ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: observed and that we can interpret that
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we're continuing
to work on, and certainly if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions or comments about which plants
might do well, our team's already been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with folks like Thomas Bjorkman
and looking at broccoli, perhaps because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the effect the temperature can have on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also really wanting to look
at how we can have that impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're having an impact,
what is it and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not having an impact,
why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we do to change that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, as I mentioned, really aiming
for a more robust sampling of our visitor
[SPEAKER_00]: surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we'd also like to do is to do
some visitor observations of how people
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the garden, what kinds of questions
they have, are they making observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're able to do some interviews with
visitors, we'd like to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitative data as well as the visitor
data, survey data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, what we'd like to do is to
figure out if this is appropriate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: project that we can replicate,
that other gardens or other organizations
[SPEAKER_00]: can do their gardens relatively
inexpensively and have the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: impact for their region and use this as a
tool to help visitors understand about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to share some words of
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Josh and Chris at the
beginning, but there's a host of other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are working on this project with
us, folks like Donna Levy, who's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be managing the garden for us this season,
Sarah Fiorello, who really has been
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in helping us with the
interpretation for this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gentleman there on the bottom left is
Jonathan Schult from communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Nina Bassick and David Wolf have
also agreed to work with us and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate with us on the project to
really help us understand some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we're still looking to figure
out about plants, what effect we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants and what's the reason for that
effect and some of these irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a great meeting last week and
are very excited to have them working with
[SPEAKER_00]: us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a host of folks at
Cornell Plantations who, without him,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wouldn't have this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either they are out there installing this
garden, helping us find plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've had a host of really
phenomenal graduate students, people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily Rodecker and Julie Romula Aldez,
who I don't have a picture of,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was the young woman who did all those
graphics that I was showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike Roberts, who is also an
employee at Plantations, but he's now
[SPEAKER_00]: working on a master's in looking at
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a one-woman show except for
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just want to recognize the
support that we've gotten financially from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Torch Sustainability Foundation,
the Atkinson Center for Sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: Future, Cornell Plantations and the
Department of Landscape Architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who've made this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I will end and be happy to
take any suggestions or questions or
[SPEAKER_00]: comments that you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, actually, cursory looking at
the plants, it looks like plants did
[SPEAKER_01]: better in the tunnel than they did outside
the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the choice of plants is really
going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things you mentioned that
jumped out at me is iris versicolor is a
[SPEAKER_01]: obligate wetland plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be, it's a wetland
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're in a situation where
probably you won't do better in either
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just thinking about those plants that
really are going to show what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking at it says, hey, they did
better in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the visitor observation
that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I picked those photos to show the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other photos that show the
opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going through the garden on
that particular day, that's what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that effect with all of those
tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it on, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are you dealing with rain inside
the tunnel?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a water gauge outside that
measures rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've been doing is watering the
same amount inside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a gauge on the hose that
waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at this point keeping the soil
moisture equivalent in both outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're watering the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, it sounds like you might not be
watering the foliage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that could be a big part of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just recently came up that when
you're hand watering, you're cooling the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're gutting on the foliage,
and how are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were discussing last week is if
we can get your irrigation there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might even be able to control it
and make sure that they're equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to keep them equivalent,
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to say, OK, if the heat
wave ends the drought, then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: withhold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go for Randy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonia, similarly in terms of the plant
material selection, you've selected plants
[SPEAKER_04]: for inside the high tunnel that have a
warmer range in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might you also have a set of plants that
are typically found in more cooler ranges
[SPEAKER_04]: to show them being heat stressed in that
future scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants that we had in the 2014
season had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some that would show stress under
cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't make it through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they would also have plants that
were more temperate here, more adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: this climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the second season, we didn't go to
that extreme in terms of having all those
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a constant conversation that
we're having about how to evolve,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are we not only telling the story of
how things are going to be adversely
[SPEAKER_00]: affected, but might we also be telling the
story about resilience and how we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to adapt to this at some level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe we can bring in some of these
plants that are being bred for warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how might our farmers or agricultors
use them here, or even the home gardener?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that a goal of the garden,
both in terms of plantings and
[SPEAKER_05]: interpretive signage, is to increase
awareness among the visiting public of the
[SPEAKER_05]: reality and seriousness of climate change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, an even higher goal is to move
visitors to action.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is any of the future interpretation
going to address actual actions that
[SPEAKER_05]: people can take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, that's the ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that we have right now
that's doing that is the brochure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which provides information, as I mentioned
from David's chapter, that gives gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: a tool, their how to adapt their garden or
things that they can do to mitigate using
[SPEAKER_00]: their garden to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our future Blue Sky discussions
have been having another high tunnel and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing how you might adapt or things you
might mitigate in your garden and what
[SPEAKER_00]: impact that has.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that there's some hope that
this serves as a model that can be used in
[SPEAKER_03]: other gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious if you have heard about,
have other gardens contacted you about
[SPEAKER_03]: this program?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have you had an opportunity to present
this model?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you waiting to fine tune it before
doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, we don't really want to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, part of that is we want to make
sure it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also want that feedback in terms of
what other gardens are likely to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that would work well for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the funds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at relatively expensive, a high
tunnel is still $10,000, plus all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant material and beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were, the American Public Garden
Association, they're aware that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're serving as a clearinghouse for
others who are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through them, I've been contacted
quite a bit by other gardeners and in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: was invited to speak at last summer's
Botanic Gardens Conservation International
[SPEAKER_00]: about this project and was asked to be a
part of climate about how gardens can
[SPEAKER_00]: educate about climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will be presenting at this
summer's APGA seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were invited to participate in
two grant programs about climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: education and that this would be a model
that we would be sharing and talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: other gardens about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep our fingers crossed on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there also will be an article that
Sonya has authored about the climate
[SPEAKER_05]: change garden in the next issue of Public
Garden Magazine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious what the state was with
the widget that's monitoring and doing all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Pete's class last semester which
was sort of a loose collective of students
[SPEAKER_02]: working on that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Pete has left and taken a new
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the reports that we were getting,
even though I don't quite understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I called it a widget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not really sure how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pete, Josh really understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pete, although he's left to go to
another position, he's still in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually meeting on site later
this month for us to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: install it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's electrical powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll have a solar panel that will
power it so we can walk the walk with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully it will be installed by
the end of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll be using it for the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, come down and see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help us interpret it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to thank Sonja for a
fascinating seminar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all need to make the trek down
the hill to see the climate change part in
[SPEAKER_05]: this growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
