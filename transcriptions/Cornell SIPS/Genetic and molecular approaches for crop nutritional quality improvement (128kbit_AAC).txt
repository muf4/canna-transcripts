[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Susan, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always nice to talk to your
colleagues about your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to tell some of our
recent research on crop nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: quality improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab has been focused on mainly four
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the carotenoid research,
and the anthocyanin, selenium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the microlutrient biofortification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'm just going to tell you some
of our recent research results on
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a slide I always like to use to
introduce carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carotenoids are not new to any of us,
because carotenoid gave the red,
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, and the yellow color fine humaling
vegetables, fruits, and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we interested in carotenoid
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because carotenoids are known to
be important in human nutrition and
[SPEAKER_00]: health, like in reducing the risk of
cancer, heart disease, and age-related eye
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the carotenoids we call
pro-vitamin A carotenoids, like
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene contains one or two
beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are known to provide the
precursor for vitamin A synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since our humans can't synthesize the
vitamin A, so all of the vitamin A in our
[SPEAKER_00]: diet can be ultimately traced back to
carotenoid origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many staple crops are known to contain
very low level of carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they contribute to the global
prevalence of vitamin A deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, vitamin A deficiency
affects a large number of preschool
[SPEAKER_00]: children and the pregnant women in those
poor areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, carotenoids are C40
terpenoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway has
been very well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over half a century ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many carotenoids, because they double
bond and the ring structure, give
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we know tomato is red color,
because tomato accumulate lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: lycopene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carrots is orange color, because
accumulate lots of alpha-carotene and
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many yellow flowers, like daffodil,
is yellow color, because accumulate lutein
[SPEAKER_00]: and other xanthophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the past two decades,
we also start to understand the process to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce apocrytonoids, including some
plant homers, ADA, and stracolactin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also beta ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are volatile compounds to give flower
fruits the flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the genes in the carotenoid
biosynthetic pathway have been major
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the genes in the major carotenoid
biosynthetic pathway have been cloned and
[SPEAKER_00]: well studied from many crops and plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, till now, we still have a very
limited knowledge about the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and the richter genes control the
expression of those pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carotenoids essentially are synthesized
in plastic, in plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carotenoids can synthesize in nearly
all kinds of plastic, like aminoplasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: chromoplasts, and chloroplasts,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they accumulate in high levels in
chloroplasts, in green leaf tissues,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in chromoplasts, found in many
flower fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the ultimate goal of our research is
to understand how plants can synthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: high level of carotenoids, so this is our
focus, to try to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids are synthesized and regulate
in chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for many of you know, for a long time,
my lab has been working with the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that was originally cloned from
orange cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use the map-based cloning strategy,
we cloned this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And found it does not encode an enzyme
involved with carotenoid biosensitical
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, it encode a protein with one
on low function and contain DAAJ-16 rich
[SPEAKER_00]: domain, but it's not chaperone protein by
itself because it's lack of the J domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently, in collaborate with Israeli
scientists, we found that the O-R gene
[SPEAKER_00]: also controls beta-carotene synthesis in
melon fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our collaborator from Israel,
and they made a cross between the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: melon fruits, with the orange green melon
fruits, and the F2 population in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found the orange fruit flash
segregates with three to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, this tray segregates as a
monogenetic dominant trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did association analyze,
and they found that the O-R gene
[SPEAKER_00]: completely co-segregates with the flash
color in this F2 mapping population,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see, with green flash fruits
contain this pair, and orange contains
[SPEAKER_00]: this pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, they also servered a wide
genetic collection they have, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: found the O-R gene existed in two
haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is associated with green flash from
all of those germ plants collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one is associated with either yellow
or either orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in collaboration with them,
we cloned the O-R gene from green flash
[SPEAKER_00]: and orange flash fruits, and we
transformed them into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: the O-R gene from orange flash fruits can
induce carotenoid accretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the gene from the green flash
fruits can't introduce additional
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid accumulation, just like a wild
type control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the CDNA sequence between
these two varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six SNPs, and five of them cause
silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them cause missense mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, the nature genetic
variation shows that in green flash fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: contain the G, and in the orange contains
the A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the change, it's caused one
single amino acid change, to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: arginine in the O-R into histine in the
orange O-R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see if this slip or this single
nucleotide difference is indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the fruit flash color,
and the nucleotide was mutagenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is that we changed the G
into A in the green gene, and we changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the A into G in the orange gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the green gene now can
induce carotenoid accumulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the red genes can't introduce
carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this confirms the effect that indeed
this slip is responsible for the O-R
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called this slip golden slip,
and we called it golden slip because with
[SPEAKER_00]: this single slip change, one amino acid,
and it can cause beta-carotene
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, and also change the fruit
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this golden slip is responsible for
all the metal color difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least from those germ plasma
collaborate to collect from all around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question we ask was,
does this golden slip also work in other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant O-R genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is that we changed the
conserved, we did site-direct mutagenized
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the conserved arginine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in aerobidopsis,
O-R gene changed arginine to histidine,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylalanine, lysine, and alanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also changed the nearby arginine
into histidine and transformed those
[SPEAKER_00]: construct into plants to look at the color
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, when we altered
the conserved arginine into histidine in
[SPEAKER_00]: the aerobidopsis O-R gene, and it caused
the carotenoid, it caused the color change
[SPEAKER_00]: in aerobidopsis cari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the color change and
found that the color is indeed associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with increased carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, if we look at the
profile, and we found that the
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene ratio in the white color,
only 15%, but this become over 50% during
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks of dark incubations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, we found the histidine
substitution in a crop O-R, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sorghum O-R gene, it also caused
the same effect, lead to a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid.
Accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, we found that the histidines,
not the only amino acids, showed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed that the alanine replacement in
the O-R gene is also equally effective to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote carotenoid overproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the color structure become
dark orange and showed a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this experiment shows that both O-R
hist or O-R alanine can serve as effective
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic tools for carotenoid accumulation,
for carotenoid manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this finding mean for
carotene improvement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when we first clone the
cauliflower O-R gene, and we test its
[SPEAKER_00]: effect to improve crop nutritional
quality, and we collaborate with Joyce
[SPEAKER_00]: Weig, and we put the cauliflower O-R gene
into potato tubers, and the O-R transgene
[SPEAKER_00]: does not only induce carotenoid increase
in the fresh plate tubers, but during the
[SPEAKER_00]: storage, it stimulates contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuous accumulation of beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, following five months
of storage, the carotenoid increased over
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 times in some lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, in collaboration with
Mike Mizor, we also look at the carotenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation during storage of the squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the color become
darker during storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also associated with increased
carotenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this means, actually the
significance of this finding is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know staple crops, as I just mentioned,
staple crops with low level of
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene contribute to the global
prevalence of vitamin A deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the beta-carotene in
staple crops is not very stable during
[SPEAKER_00]: storage, because in most of the case,
those beta-carotene are synthesized and
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in amyloplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through this two O-R transgene
experiment in potato tubers, and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: squash experiment, we know that the O-R
gene in the squash case, in both cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: they provide some unique mechanism to
improve for beta-carotene synthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: also stable storage during the storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-carotene stability during the
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can find the mechanism,
maybe we have a way to improve our staple
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, which enhances the beta-carotene
level, not only for continuous synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also stable storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: During post-harvest storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you that in orange
cauliflower, we know the mutations are due
[SPEAKER_00]: to an insertion of large transphosa
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the melon case, the mutations
is due to a nature variation with a single
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because this is single nucleotide,
we prove that the single nucleotide change
[SPEAKER_00]: to change a specific amino acid,
and this is change the functionality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the O-R to promote carotenoid
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of us know that genome editing
become the technology to use to change our
[SPEAKER_00]: genome to enhance, to change, to improve
economic trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are waiting for the maturity or
advanced of the technology so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically replace one or two
nucleotides to change one amino acid to
[SPEAKER_00]: see its effect, improve for beta-carotene
accumulation in staple crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in collaborate with Peter
Bear, the inventor of golden rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are trying to put our O-R hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are trying to manipulate the rice O-R
gene to change the arginine into histine
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if it can help, indeed can help
improve the total carotenoid level in
[SPEAKER_00]: golden rice, and most importantly,
see if it can help stabilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene during post-harvest storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's telling methods and also looking
for later genetic variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through those approach, we are hoping
in future we can improve the staple crop
[SPEAKER_00]: for beta-carotene level, not only through
transgender approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we know it's not in good stage to do
that, but we believe we can get use of
[SPEAKER_00]: some way to improve, to create a
functional allele of the O-R gene in
[SPEAKER_00]: staple crops through non, through
traditional breeding approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some of you already noticed that
in our experiment, we expressed both
[SPEAKER_00]: Y-type O-R gene and the mutant O-R gene,
and although both of them showed a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: level of gene expression and also a
similar level of protein expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they showed dramatic difference in
induced carotenoid accumulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see, both the color and the
total carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question we were asking was,
how does the O-R hits or all the O-R
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant differentially regulate carotenoid
accumulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question, we tried to
ask what is the function of the Y-type O-R
[SPEAKER_00]: gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question, we were
looking for O-R interacting proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find O-R interacting proteins,
we use the co-immunoprecipitation in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with mass-spectrum analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially we have for aerobidopsis
plants express the O-R Y-type gene tagged
[SPEAKER_00]: with GFP and the GFP only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extract protein from these plants and
mix with beads, and then you loot out the
[SPEAKER_00]: co-immunoprecipitated protein,
and in collaboration with Pat Tenhouser at
[SPEAKER_00]: our USDA unit, and his lab analyzed those
gel bands and identified around 19
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that can be, this is 19 conserved
proteins, actually from each gel band we
[SPEAKER_00]: identified more than 100 proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially from multi-biological
replicate samples, we identified 19
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins as potential candidates for O-R
interacting proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excitingly, we found the PSY or
phytonic synthesis as one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is PSY?
[SPEAKER_00]: The PSY or phytonic synthesis is the rate
limiting enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, and it's also the first enzyme in
this specific pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of experiments to show that
manipulation of the PSY expression can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a profound effect on total carotenoid
accumulation, and here I show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: example, like a golden rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's golden rice one and golden rice
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the carotenoid level is quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the only difference between
golden rice two and golden rice one is
[SPEAKER_00]: change the PSY, and golden rice two use
the high active PSY from maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: and golden rice one use PSY from daffodil
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also here's golden cologne.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just express the PSY.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the cologne seeds color change
from green to orange color, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous experiments to show that you
express any PSY from any plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you can get orange colors,
showed like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to confirm that the PSY is indeed the
OR interacting proteins, we use the three
[SPEAKER_00]: different approach to confirm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first through yeast 2-hype for assay,
and as you can see, not only cauliflower
[SPEAKER_00]: OR, but aerodopsis OR, there's a larger
OR-like protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all interact with the PSY in yeast
2-hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also did a pull-down assay to
confirm such interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, when you mix the
PSY-tagged protein with OR-tagged protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the OR pull-down with GFP,
and you can detect with CMAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows the direct interaction, but not in
those selective controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third approach, we use the BIFC,
and further confirm such interaction in
[SPEAKER_00]: vivo, in plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the site of crowd noise synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this interaction mean,
and how does this interaction affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: PSY expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generate the OR overexpressed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got the lockout, and also generate
the double lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, with those aerodopsis
lines, they show the dramatic difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in OR protein and gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at PSY gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, the alteration of the
OR expression does not affect gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we looked at the protein level,
and as this slide shows you, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpressed of the OR genes cause
increased accumulation of PSY.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the single lockout, the PSY protein
level is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think they complement with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the double lockout, the PSY protein
level was significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showed in leave case,
and similar in root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the similar pattern of the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the OR affect the PSY
abundance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know with overexpressed PSY reduce
PSY, overexpressed OR reduce expressed OR,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this cause the PSY change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does OR affect the PSY abundance?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we introduced the PSY
GFP-tagged protein into white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of aerodopsis, and also into OR
background aerodopsis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we extracted the protein and
inhibit with CHF, the protein synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor, and then looking for the PSY
GFP protein level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, in the OR background,
the turnover rate of the PSY was
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly dramatically reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared without the protection of OR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, our collaborator,
Ralph Welsh, from Germany, and he also
[SPEAKER_00]: looked to see if they increased the PSY
protein level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the enzyme active or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often when you upregulate a protein,
it can be just the protein level
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not necessarily means active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from his results clearly showed that
with overexpressed OR increase the PSY
[SPEAKER_00]: protein level cause increased enzyme
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know that PSY is the key enzyme in
the carotenoid biosensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the correlate accumulation of
carotenoid was observed in leaf tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: when we have overexpressed PSY.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's dramatically reduced when
the OR level was reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary of this part, essentially we
showed that both OR and OR-like directly
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with the PSY to enhance the PSY
protein level and activity through
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated PSY protein stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because PSY is the key enzyme in the
carotenoid biosensis pathway, it's cause
[SPEAKER_00]: increased carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually this is one of the first case
demonstrate a protein can act as the
[SPEAKER_00]: post-transcriptional regulator of PSY to
regulate carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come back to the same question we
tried to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does OR mutant differentially
regulate carotenoid accumulation in both
[SPEAKER_00]: of these case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the differential regulation through
differentially regulate PSY?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there are some other mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question and we compared
the OR-his and the OR interaction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: PSY is still too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see both OR-his and OR-Y type
protein interact with PSY.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them also cause increased PSY
protein level in carotenoid culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked again in collaborate
with Ralph Wersch from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at the PSY enzyme activity from
OR-his line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which indicates that the differentially
induced carotenoid accumulation is not due
[SPEAKER_00]: to the OR-his has a high capacity to
increase the PSY activity or increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: biosensitc activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So previously in our study we showed that
with the OR mutation in cauliflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the single gene mutation,
it caused the change from numerous pro
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic into one or two large chrome
plastic in the curd-influenced merstem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and also in the epidermal shoot
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, our collaborators from Israel,
and they also observed in mellow case,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look on the light microscope and
there's one or two large chrome plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: per cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you look at the tomato,
each cell contain a huge number of chrome
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of them showed that the mutation
or the later variation can induce large
[SPEAKER_00]: chrome plastic formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened with aerobidopsis with
Kali that showed the difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big difference with carotenoid
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at this is the long transgenic
aerobidopsis Kali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there is a plastic contain
some dark circle that's plus globule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the overexpressed OR gene,
the plastic will become a larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they retain the same shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plus globule become darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the high electrode dense,
this is the same as the PSY-only express.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe carotenoids are accumulated
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the OR-HIS mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see the plastic shape changed
from those and become the membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually those membrane structures,
membrane chrome plastic show exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as what we observed in orange curd
cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those experiments confirm, showed that
the key for the specific high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid accumulation is due to the
unique ability of the OR-HIS in induced
[SPEAKER_00]: chrome plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually this experiment is fairly
significant in a larger way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know aerobidopsis are excellent model
system to understand gene signaling in
[SPEAKER_00]: many process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, aerobidopsis doesn't contain a
tissue with chrome plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially we show here now we
generate aerobidopsis lines that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: program to be able to form chrome plastic,
therefore provide us a system to better
[SPEAKER_00]: study genes and signaling in chrome
plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's from our research, we showed
that the OR mutant has dual functions in
[SPEAKER_00]: induced carotenoid overproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is as post-transcriptional regulators
to regulate PSY enzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a larger one is actually the most
important is they have unique ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: induce chrome plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because chrome plastic provide a
storage thing that can stably storage the
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids at the same time it's also
stimulate to continue biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the lines can, those plants or
those lines can have a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently we still focused on OR because
till now OR still is the only genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: know to convert to chrome plastic
biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but how this OR gene control chrome
plastic genesis is still unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a topic that we are focused on
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to those research we also
take the advantage of various omic tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to discover genes and proteins required
for high level of carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one full experiment we did is a protein
omic analyze of chrome plastic proteins in
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here we extract chrome
plastic from some of carotenoid enriched
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are hoping to looking for the
common mechanism involved in those
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid enriched crops for chrome
plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we separate the chrome plastic proteins
from those vegetables and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing interesting we found that if
you look at their all chrome plastic the
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP synthesis and ATP-ATP translocators
are most abundant proteins in those all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those six chrome plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the high abundance of ATP synthesis and
the nucleotide translocators suggest an
[SPEAKER_00]: important role of them in control or
energy production and transport in control
[SPEAKER_00]: chrome plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one project is going on in the lab
is we trying to figure out if the ATP and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ADP translocators indeed involved with
chrome plastic biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition we also did quite a lot of
RNA-seq experiment in collaborate with
[SPEAKER_00]: many colleagues on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our experiment is the bulk
segregate RNA-seq transcript on analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again in collaborate with Israeli
scientists we use the same lines to start
[SPEAKER_00]: the ORR gene in melon fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did is they grow the
homozygous F3 family plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted the RNA from 25 orange or green
fruits at a various fruits developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually here are the RNA samples
showed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bulked those RNA and did the
transcript on analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's to show the carotenoid
metabolic pathway gene expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the orange melon
accumulate a high level for beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that all the upstream genes are
upregulated during fruit development,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar as the fruit mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the downstream genes are downregulated
during fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very interestingly in orange fruits
and the carotenoid accumulate but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: green fruit there's no huge carotenoid
accumulation but the gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern is similar which indicate
additional mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case we believe the storage sync
mechanism difference between the green and
[SPEAKER_00]: the orange fruits to distinguish the two
kinds of fruit varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition in collaborate with
Zhongjing Fei at BTI he help us to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those transcript on data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition he also did the sleep
analyze of the orange and green bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this bulks essentially we only
got very low only 64 sleeps with overnight
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 90% of rate to distinguish orange
and the green bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see those sleep only two genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the OR gene and there's another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally completely distinguish,
100% distinguish between the bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't know the OR gene is
responsible for the orange color through
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulk segregate RNA stick analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would identify the OR gene which also
showed effectiveness of the bulk strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: for gene discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another co-segregated gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently a visitor scientist Hongmei Luo
in the lab is study that gene to see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: also contribute to the carotenoid
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the differential expressed
gene at a different fruit development
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there's only one gene
showed differential expressed in all
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits development stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are mainly focused on the 20 DA2
and we select a few candidate genes for
[SPEAKER_00]: functional analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you the irobidopsis color system
we used to start the OR function and it
[SPEAKER_00]: showed very responsive and effective to
response the genes that's involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that the irobidopsis with
flowering, dipping method you can
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously transform a lot of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this system also really give us a
relatively high throughput to test those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and the proteins identified from
other omics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition as I told you that in many
cases it's no OR control the orange versus
[SPEAKER_00]: non-orange fruit flash color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see the OR gene plus collection
there are several magnitude of variation
[SPEAKER_00]: of a beta carotene levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again in collaborative with the Israeli
scientists we are going to genome type
[SPEAKER_00]: those germ plus collection by GBS and then
look the association between the mellow
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit beta carotene content and the later
genetic variation not only to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: some markers to be used for mellow
breeding but we are hoping to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: additional alleles that control high level
of carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary our data shows that the OR
mutant can serve as effective genetic tube
[SPEAKER_00]: for carotenoid enhancement in food crops
both through genetic and traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also OR mediates beta carotene over
production through regulate both PSY with
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced biosensors ability and also
chromeplaster with storage abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned we believe that if we
can put the carotenoid into chromeplaster
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of amloplast we can help to it can
significantly help to stabilize the beta
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene stable crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things our data shows that
the post transcriptional regulate of PSY
[SPEAKER_00]: represent lava mechanism under carotenoid
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally I'd like to thank co-workers
here that people currently in their lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially I want to thank Hui Yuan
