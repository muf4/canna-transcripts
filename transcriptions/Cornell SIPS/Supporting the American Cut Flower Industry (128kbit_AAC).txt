[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what I'd like to do this
afternoon is go through the topics as
[SPEAKER_00]: listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, knowing that it's a fairly broad
audience, I want to bring you up to date
[SPEAKER_00]: on what about the cut flower industry as
it exists here in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: South America, perhaps a little in Europe,
and then narrow down to the North American
[SPEAKER_00]: and the state situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a perhaps a little better
understanding what the industry consists
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the area of support for that
industry is fairly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to present you some
information on that, both on the extension
[SPEAKER_00]: side as well as the research side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the research side, I'm going to
mostly be talking about the fun I'm having
[SPEAKER_00]: with cut flowers or have had for the last
dozen years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say there isn't research
going on elsewhere, but I'm just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: selfish in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I lecture, I like to have an open
mic so everyone can participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are things that aren't clear,
or if you'd like to add something,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to pipe up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be glad to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states doesn't produce much in the way
of cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on primarily South America for the
cut flowers that we buy because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy them year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have Valentine's Day without roses
would be unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: To produce roses at that time of year here
is prohibitively expensive, and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers wouldn't stand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a very lively process of
importation of especially roses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do produce cut flowers here and some of
them are listed in the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing percentages as you go down of
gladiola, irises, lilies, tulips are about
[SPEAKER_00]: half and half coming from other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those tulips that we do grow here,
the bulbs are not being produced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming from Holland primarily,
Chile sometimes, so it's not really a
[SPEAKER_00]: wholly domestic industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I shouldn't wander around too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The South America aspect is highland
valleys near the equator, temperature the
[SPEAKER_00]: same year round, no photoperiod problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow them under cover, as you can see
for the mums here, and these structures
[SPEAKER_00]: here that looks like there might be
carnations underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the high tunnels that they have
there are very extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are modern, some are more
traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection from rain is primarily what
they want them for because the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how a bulk of flowers are
produced that end up in our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point about those flowers,
yes, some of them are identified and the
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA keeps track of how many stems are
being produced and what the value is and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of others, like sunflowers for
instance, which are a real big deal,
[SPEAKER_00]: they aren't keeping track of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dahlia is another one which is not
accounted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to ask the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they lump them under others and so
it's an incomplete record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the quantities in comparison to roses
are sufficiently low that they're too many
[SPEAKER_00]: different species, I think, is what's
happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are snapdragons, delphiniums,
lisianthus, which we'll be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffice to say that there are a bunch of
different flowers, each with their
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practice requirements,
post-harvest characteristics, vase life,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets to be a fairly complicated
subject and one that doesn't lend itself
[SPEAKER_00]: readily to extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So large-scale production in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: of cut flowers is primarily on the West
Coast because of their more favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic conditions than we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Washington, Oregon, toward the
coast, cool, somewhat cloudy mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sun comes out and the rest of the
day is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very regular climate which allows a lot
of different species to be grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrangea here, calla lilies in this
particular part of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other examples, a greenhouse
production of gerberas in the Watsonville
[SPEAKER_00]: area of central California, large-scale,
mostly under glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tula production, in this case in a factory
type of situation in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like I mentioned, this is
production using bulbs from Holland for
[SPEAKER_00]: some parts of the year, and then other
parts of the year when Holland can't
[SPEAKER_00]: supply, they're getting them from Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to keep producing,
in some cases hydroponically, in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases just in mix, for 10 out of 12
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year, it's too hot in the
greenhouse, so they do a poor job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rest of the time, and if you go
down to Wegmans or other stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: these would be the tulips you'll be
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say so, but this is a big,
big outfit, and there are one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: others that do a similar sort of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then other parts of California are growing
hypericum over there on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like stock in the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scabiosa, so lots of different
flowers, large-scale, but mostly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole sale kind of marketing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come closer here to the Northeast
and New York State more specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there are some large-scale producers,
and they tend to go into the wholesale
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, in fact, the picture on the upper
right is one of the large-scale peony
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that is existing just north of the
experiment station in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a second peony grower in that
same vicinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one has a farm in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a farm in Pennsylvania and a couple
of farms in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he starts harvesting in Maryland and
then works his way up so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively narrow harvesting period for
peony is extended over that four-times
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some pictures from Long Island,
Dahlia's, and Kleome, again, larger-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production close to the place where those
flowers would be in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far the largest number of producers
are, in fact, small-scale, not only here
[SPEAKER_00]: but scattered over the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this has implications as far as
extension is concerned because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to three or four big people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking to folks that are doing it
part-time, small-scale, and growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look up the book or count
the number of species listed in what we
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider the Bible of cut flower
production that Armitage and Lauschman put
[SPEAKER_00]: together, you come up with 83 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are more besides that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a number of annuals,
perennials, woody species, geophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning bulbs, and then you're using,
in many cases, flowers but could be
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage, could be the fruit, sticks,
and these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at these later in the talk to
see what specific ones we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly locally marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It avoids the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roses, carnations, mums, alstroemeria,
because they can't compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the emphasis is freshly produced,
hasn't been shipped, will last longer in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the advantage that the local
producers have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some just pictures of those
small-scale farms, a couple of them from
[SPEAKER_00]: within Tompkins County here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any of you who have gone to the Izika
Farmers Market know that there are two
[SPEAKER_00]: very good producers of cut flowers that
market there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers markets are a favorite place to
sell the flowers that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them in supermarkets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weddings and events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the wedding trade has become
quite important for the local producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're able to deal with the wives,
or sorry, the mother-in-laws that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: fussy about what color and size,
et cetera, of flowers they want,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers that can manage that at the
same time as they're producing their crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can succeed very well and the prices
are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think in the recent years
has been a shift from going to the florist
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the flowers to going to the
producers themselves and specifying I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get married in three months,
I need this color, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can be a little cheaper, but not an
awful lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's become a quite important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some roadside trade, as is shown
here from a picture on Long Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's relatively minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bouquet subscriptions so that a
restaurante gets a bouquet or 10 bouquets
[SPEAKER_00]: to put on the tables in that restaurant
once a week or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes a regular CSA,
community-supported agriculture farm that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows people to pick or get a share of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they go to the farm themselves,
they often are picking gardens where they
[SPEAKER_00]: can cut zinnias, sunflowers, gladiolites,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in some cases, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so as I've hinted all along,
the information on cut flowers is
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because there are so many
species and because there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and there are relatively few
organizations that can cater to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell Cooperative Extension is what
we go to for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask them for information on cut
flowers, you don't find very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what has happened is that they
have ceded the field to this organization
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the Association of Specialty Cut
Flower Growers, which is a national,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, even international organization
based in Ohio, run by an executive
[SPEAKER_00]: director and one or two staff,
was founded about 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a number of services that
cater very well to these diverse people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are growing a number of different
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They publish a quarterly magazine on some
folks in this room, including Bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, et cetera, have written articles
about some of the research that's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in cut flower work as part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have regional meetings and annual
meetings, depending on the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: dotted all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those can be quite important,
but what's even more important is a
[SPEAKER_00]: listserv, and that's really the extension
service that provides information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's essentially growers helping other
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many different
species, you type in there and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some information on this lesiantis
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a day, someone else says,
oh, yeah, I tried that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the end of that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there could be long discussions about
some topic about bed shapers or ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: planting seedlings, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of the older members who
are part of this organization who have
[SPEAKER_00]: been very participatory and have provided
tremendous help to new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organization, although it's nonprofit,
it does require about $200 a year for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to belong to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, as a grower, find some
information that helps you market your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers more effectively, that $200 is
paid back in that one message that you
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has succeeded very well and is
thriving, as I'll show you in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also run a coordinated variety
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers who would like to participate
are sent six packets of zinnia varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: new varieties that the seed companies want
to test out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the year, these growers
then have to write in and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, this one went fine, and the stem
length was this, and the diameter was
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and it lasted quite a while,
and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this other one, I wouldn't grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the quarterly magazine,
the January issue, has all these reports
[SPEAKER_00]: summarized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very valuable piece of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have a small research foundation
which gathers money to give out as
[SPEAKER_00]: research grants so that institutions like
Cornell could do small trials that help to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore particular things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quite a bit of post-harvest
work going on at North Carolina State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Dole runs a yearly program of testing
all the new varieties to see how long they
[SPEAKER_00]: last in the vase with different additions
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very valuable organization
that if you're at all interested in cut
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, this is the place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the current popularity of going
local and doing it yourself, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the membership numbers going up from
around 500 or so in 2008 and 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organization has become very
popular, and it's been a key to the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: of that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have perhaps some interesting
challenges ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what should be done in the
future to keep up with the demand for
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's post-harvest research is one of
the most important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Dole at NC State, as I just
mentioned, is the foremost scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: studying this area, trying to see how long
can we keep flowers alive of particular
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be putting them in water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be putting them in some kind of
flower solution, et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's his field, and I've had much
more fun with doing other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very complicated things, and I want to
tell you a bit about that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that we're just concluding now for the
second year is a chance observation that
[SPEAKER_00]: snapdragons are fairly hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in our winters here, we can have
a situation where they kind of struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the second year after you've grown
them in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a variety trial in our high
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone understand high tunnel?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is essentially a greenhouse
that doesn't have heat, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the crop in the ground,
not in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're up to them, and we keep it
covered during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some protection going on in
that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are experiments that we have been
doing in the high tunnel situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this case also comparing with
growth in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a series of planting dates
trying to see how can we produce this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we can extend the season
earlier with a tunnel, we were able to sow
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed in mid-February, and we were
harvesting by the 31st of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the field planting, we came in a
couple of weeks later or a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a second tunnel planting came in
about mid-September.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields in the first three were quite
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one didn't really have enough
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we followed up on this work a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a variety trial in the high tunnel
where we were looking at just performance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of that fall season,
the plants looked so good, I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, let's just see if they can survive
over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, some of them did quite
well and came back, and we harvested the
[SPEAKER_00]: second crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the yields here,
and this is yield per unit area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first one, Chantilly, the yield
went down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one did fine in the fall,
but then it was mostly winter killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't anything left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yield was essentially fall,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a problem of winter damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we didn't do anything extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't put any extra protection on
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just surviving, or not as the
case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look down the rest of the list
and see that some did fine, and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, this Potomac Lavender, in fact,
gave higher yields in the spring than it
[SPEAKER_00]: did in the fall before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it showed that, yes, you can
overwinter this crop, and that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that a grower in our region
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we followed up on that this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a more regular experiment where we,
again, sowed the seed in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry, in the summer for the fall
harvest, and then kept the plants over
[SPEAKER_00]: until the spring, but protected them in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that result showed, first of all,
that, again, we could see varietal
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in winter survival,
but we also could make quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in winter survival by keeping a
low tunnel over the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we harvested the fall crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't much left above ground,
but then put a low tunnel over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, as it started
coming up, we kept the tunnel in place
[SPEAKER_00]: until they started to shoot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, with that low tunnel
protection, we got quite a nice yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a combination of having the right
variety, and protection actually gets you
[SPEAKER_00]: around 40 stems per square foot,
which on a nine by nine inch spacing is
[SPEAKER_00]: not too shabby, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we stopped harvesting this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sick of it, and we had so many
other things that we were doing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring that they kept on growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could have gotten more stems off
this thing, but decided to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to define annual,
I think, in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends what kind of winter you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a zone seven, it's probably a
perennial, unless it's taken out by some
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, that work points to the
fact that we can, in fact, use that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, the unheated greenhouse,
as a way of perhaps having perennials that
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't make it outside do so with the
help of that structure and maybe something
[SPEAKER_00]: more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had a bit of experimentation
with Eukomas, the pineapple lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miller and his students have done much
more in that regard, but we've
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully overwintered this,
which outside, well, Bill can do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't been able to keep Eukomas
lily alive over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one that certainly can be
experimented with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agapanthus is a bit of a beautiful flower,
and I'd love to get some research going on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I'm running out of time to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm passing the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one, alstroemeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mark Bridgen, the director of the Long
Island Station, is an alstroemeria
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has developed some varieties of
alstroemeria that will do quite fine in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the normal environment,
where the stems get longer, we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to really revolutionize that crop and
use it here instead of importing it from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's work to be done, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another simple problem, a simple technique
is sort of generally, I like to see as
[SPEAKER_00]: many stems as possible per unit area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvested for these cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to be able to do is
manipulate the plants to become more
[SPEAKER_00]: productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, fine, you can just
plant them closer together and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants are expensive, and are there
other ways we can do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, horticulturists and gardeners have
known for centuries that if you pinch out
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the plant, when it's still in
its vegetative stage, you force branches
[SPEAKER_00]: from the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing this with several
species, but here's sunflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's producing about six leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out comes the growing point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you end up with then is one,
two, three branches where the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: point was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can get quite tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly you have a yield three times
of what you had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a fair amount of work in
this, especially with sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show you some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, when you do that, instead of
having one stem per unit area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to somehow manage in that
smaller amount of space per stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is the stems are
thinner and the flowers are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the control which has not been
pinched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: After pinching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a market for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do get quite a nice increase in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the back of that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that haven't been pinched,
these have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're delayed a little bit in
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, six, seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yield is increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a typical experiment,
this one from 19, or sorry, 2007,
[SPEAKER_00]: our stem numbers are increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The days to flower are delayed a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem length is reduced for individual
stem, but 60 centimeters for a stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a meter long, you're gonna put
that in a vase, it'd be way up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really only need 50 or 60
centimeters, so it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flower diameter, as I showed in
the previous picture, is also reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's feasible, and it's something
that can be easily done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned, you do sacrifice
flower size, and that can become a
[SPEAKER_00]: constraint if you overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing experiments along this
line for some time, and using different
[SPEAKER_00]: spacings, six by six inches, nine by nine
inches, 12 by 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see, as you crowd the plants
closer, and you pinch them, you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers get pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to a point where, eh,
I don't like that, it's too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are abnormalities that come in,
misshapen, these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market determines then what you can
get away with, and what you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you express it in terms of stem
yield per unit area, the more you squeeze
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the right, the more you curve this
thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the market says, well, this minimum
size that I will accept is around 1.5
[SPEAKER_00]: inches, then you better not go any higher
than 6,000 stems per 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that kind of relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within this, of course, you will have
differences between varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ProCut Amber Glow, that inverted
triangle, is one that has a larger flower
[SPEAKER_00]: to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you squeeze it, it also reduces in
size, but that line is above the line of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other two varieties that have smaller
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this relationship is something that can
be quite useful and might be a good guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're into pinching, let's pinch
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lysianthus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful flower, looks like a rose,
lasts a long time in the vase,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vase back in the corner over there
when you have some more snacks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to take a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this plant produces several stems per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the sunflower, you're already
starting with several.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you pinch it early, it will produce
branches, but your increase in yield is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be less than what you'd get with
a single stem sunflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you still, again by manipulating the
spacing, the amount of area per plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can again increase productivity
fairly, a fair amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are experiments that we're
doing again this year, this is last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: with using two spacings, 6x6 and 9x9,
pinching or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our stem length, interestingly enough,
at least at the closest spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening here is that the
stems are closer together, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching for the light and they're
actually getting longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at the yield, per square foot,
15 against 11, or the way we had been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it before, we're only getting
maybe nine or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowering dates are delayed a
little bit by pinching, but not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a combination of close spacing,
and pinching is actually giving us quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this is a 6x6, this is a
9x9 that hasn't been pinched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same variety, 6x6, 9x9 with
pinching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this stretching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cheating a little bit,
this whole thing should be shifted up,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it isn't showing, isn't giving the
whole truth, but you'll have to trust me
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, second last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflowers may or may not react to day
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, if you're just
producing sunflowers during the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sensitivity to this day length is
happening in the first three weeks after
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, the flower has either already
formed or will be somewhat delayed
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found in screening that some are
what we would call facultative short day
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that even if the day length is
long, they will eventually come to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're day neutral, and then we found
a few that are actually contrary,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do it the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're delayed by short days,
but not by long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked with a screening test
which allows us to grow the plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse under controlled day length
conditions for the first three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we transplant them to the field
and then measure what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some varieties, it's quite drastic in
fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one that's sensitive and give
it short days, it stays small,
[SPEAKER_00]: it flowers three weeks earlier,
and then the one that's growing under long
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other characteristics change as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it closely, and one of the
varieties that is most sensitive is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually this industry standard here in
upstate New York a variety called Sunrich
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under short day conditions, it develops
these ugly little, it's like super
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas under long day conditions,
it behaves itself and looks just like
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd expect a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a closeup of the budding over
there on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know whether a
variety is going to react that way or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some other characteristics
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the short day sensitive
variety, and this is a test that we did in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 of newer varieties, under short day
conditions, it flowered in 50 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: took almost 70 days under long day
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants were speeded up quite a lot,
and as a result, plants were small,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flower diameter was small as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the day neutrals, not much difference
between the two treatments, and the long
[SPEAKER_00]: day is reversed to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers delayed under short day
conditions, not so much under long day,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can make quite a bit of difference,
and it will make difference for people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are using high tunnels to grow an early
crop of sunflowers because they're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in when March April when the day
length is still short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're triggered, and you get
early flowering, that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plants are like this, and the plants
are ugly, so you can't market them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're growing in Florida or South
Carolina or someplace, then again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know whether the plants are
sensitive or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudebeckia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't growing them this year,
but very showy flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some pictures a little later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're finding, this is back 2005,
that the later you go in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant them in the spring, and they
have very nice stems, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, and so on, but they keep
flowering all summer long, which is nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the stem length gets shorter and
shorter and shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need fertilizer, or what's going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decided to look in the
literature and found out that it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: obligate long day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it reacts to the day length
requirement is not that it stops
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, it sort of gradually gets
shorter, as if the stem length is dictated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the day length under which that flower
is developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some experiments with shading,
trying to lengthen the stems and this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really make any difference,
and you just have these parallel lines all
[SPEAKER_00]: going down into the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we keep stems long?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do it economically, so have to
come up with instruments that can do this
[SPEAKER_00]: for us without having to pay NICEG all
sorts of fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, if you turn a flower
field into a used car park, you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bills that you might not be able
to really justify for a crop like
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudbeckia here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing that we used is a light
that shines down on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has a solar cell above.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like things that you see on sidewalks
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, hey, that works pretty good,
except that the amount of light it's shows
[SPEAKER_00]: is relatively small and it's focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants over here didn't get the
signal, so they're still as short as
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do the whole bed,
you'd spend a fortune on light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got even more innovative,
decided, oh, the way we can do this is use
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, solar powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these from Amazon,
no sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there you see the black string
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the light shining down,
and you see the plant saying, meh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So innovation didn't work in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided we needed to really do a
little science in this and figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how much light does it actually need
in order to trigger the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_00]: response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have this very nice greenhouse
set up at Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the old gentleman that we were
using for the photoperiod reaction of
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflowers that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can put curtains over the top and
just say, OK, the day length is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain's closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used that and closed the
curtains at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the curtain goes this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at the end, we put in these
lights that kept the day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 16 hours, so the long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, and you only put
lights at one end, then only the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are actually sensing the light will
flower or have some kind of stem length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the others won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones close to the light are flowering
and looking very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys down here are producing
spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who wants to eat rootvecchia spinach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, then we can get a test of
how much light you really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the height of the flowers related to
the day length extension, the intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: light of the day length extension,
shows that it's about 3 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter that's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it does really require the light
equivalent to what you'd have in a used
[SPEAKER_00]: car lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we aren't going to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what to do instead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think what we have to go back to
is the germplasm of rootvecchia and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find varieties of rootvecchia that are day
neutral like some of the sunflower
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that we were working with
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not a reader and I run out of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody is looking for a thesis
project, come and talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be happy to put you to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a variety like Indian
summer, which is a very popular variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: under 12 hours, no flowers, under 16
hours, it's doing what it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time for me to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd like to conclude is first of
all to summarize that in the cut flower
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, local cut flower industry in the
Northeastern United States, in the states
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, is increasingly producing
products that people want and producing
[SPEAKER_00]: income for those people that are growing
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an important one, which I think
really does require quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: backstopping as they help themselves as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Association of Specially Cut
Flower Growers is that organization that's
[SPEAKER_00]: helping them quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplying them with research is something
that I've had the privilege to do and have
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has gotten into some extension
work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I should have spent about half an
hour thanking people, some of you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, many of you in the room,
and many others in the Department Now
[SPEAKER_00]: section and others who have been
instrumental in helping me work in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field and getting the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two that I want to mention that are
sitting in the front here are Priscilla
[SPEAKER_00]: and Emily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who have put in long hours this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow after all the years of research,
I haven't been able to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow only a few crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, oh man, this looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put in a variety trial of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been the suffering beasts of
burden and have in fact spent time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them all harvested and measured and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that and thank you very
much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm managers, the greenhouse
managers, all their staff have been
[SPEAKER_00]: essential in this work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people in the Department,
I really thank everyone very, very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I especially want to also mention Bill
Miller and Neil Matson who have had the
[SPEAKER_00]: privilege to work with on some of this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that has really helped a
tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are questions and if there is
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
