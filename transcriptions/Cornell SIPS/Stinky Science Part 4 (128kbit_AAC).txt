If
[SPEAKER_00]: you think of other plants around the world
that do things in this spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion, Hawaiian silver swords,
for example, the giant puya from Bolivia
[SPEAKER_00]: and Peru, other examples, the century
plant, the giant agaves from our own
[SPEAKER_00]: deserts, these plants are like salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live a long time, they reproduce
once, and it exhausts and kills them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the act of reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's remarkable to me about this is that
it's marshaling that kind of energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of floral display, but it gets a
chance to reproduce over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we were discussing before you
all arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it balance its energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it engage in just really
extraordinary photosynthetic rates and
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic productivity in ways that
those other plants can't?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants I mentioned either grow
at high elevation in the tropics or on
[SPEAKER_00]: desert islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem there is not photosynthesis,
because they have lots of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants don't have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in rainforests and they're not
limited by moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: As another lesson, it reminds us that
plant reproductive strategies are also
[SPEAKER_00]: limited by where they live, what kind of
soil they're on, what kind of environment
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we're looking to study
this time around, we tracked, as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see in this sheet, we tracked the odors
that we've studied in other plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we expected to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been other people studying this
plant and publishing their results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't shocked by anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our faculty, Carl Nicklaus,
for example, smelled the fishy odor on the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning after and asked, is there an amine
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, they're very low levels of
compounds that we're very sensitive to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimethylamine is kind of rotting fish
odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've wondered this time around is,
is that actually a volatile coming off the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen grains, because it started showing
up in our study when the pollen was
[SPEAKER_00]: available inside the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we might like to collect
some pollen and do a separate collection
[SPEAKER_00]: from the pollen itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that's of more than trivial
interest is for the animals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting covered and coated with pollen,
it's very important that they don't groom.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question that commonly arises when we
look at this plant is, why is it so large?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why so big?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so overstated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in nature that's exaggerated or
overstated is interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that people suggest is
that the population density of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grow in groves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one here, one there, that they
have to advertise from a distance to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their pollinators to find them the second
time, the third time, because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work unless they get duped two or three
times in the process of a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we've wanted to know is,
how does that transition work from female
[SPEAKER_00]: stage to male stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flies have to fly with the pollen on
their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have to fly 500 meters or a
kilometer or two or three kilometers to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the next one of these before they can
complete the loop and enclose the loop on
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that they don't groom the
pollen off their bodies while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch insects as much as we do,
a lot of insects are fastidious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hit four or five flowers,
fly to a perch, sit on the perch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then brush themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flies are very good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all seen them do this with their
hind legs and their fore legs and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have brushes on their legs to clean
their antennae so they can smell again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our moths that we study, we study these
very large hawk moths that visit night
[SPEAKER_00]: blooming flowers like the Darwin's Orchid
from Madagascar that Paul has shared with
[SPEAKER_00]: us in years past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't groom, and they're gypsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly tens of miles a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a dream for plants because they
don't waste the plant's pollen investment
[SPEAKER_00]: in them, and they're able to move pollen
long distances without wiping it off their
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're kind of interested in the male
part of the plant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the insects leaving at dawn the
following day, and are they doing so with
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on their bodies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there something about the odor of
that pollen that might make them more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to leave it where it is?

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
