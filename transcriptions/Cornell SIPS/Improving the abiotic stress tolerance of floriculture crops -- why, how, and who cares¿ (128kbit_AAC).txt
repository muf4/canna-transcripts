[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd put my acknowledgment slide
first since the end is always hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numerous people that were possible
that made the research possible that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in a bit, as well as many
funding sources that made this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably oversights,
but this is a decent stab at the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to do was first kind of put
things into perspective and talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about the floriculture and
horticulture and the importance that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the US and the New York economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talk a bit more about abiotic
stress tolerance and then kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, look at case studies in abiotic stress
tolerance in floriculture crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be a primary focus of my
research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the horticulture
industry in the US, you can broadly divide
[SPEAKER_00]: it into three groups, fruits, nuts,
and berries, which in 2007 were worth
[SPEAKER_00]: $18.6 billion wholesale farm gate value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second would be nursery, greenhouse,
and sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: So floriculture would very much fit into
this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be the crops that you can't
eat, but you can still enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then vegetables for $14.7 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collectively about $50 billion worth of
horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare that to the hundreds of
millions of acres of corn and soybeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat that are grown, they're valued at
$77.2 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a much more intensive
type of agriculture production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floriculture industry, specifically in
the US, which would be comprised primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: of cut flowers, potted plants,
bedding plants, and propagative materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings, and seeds, and bulbs,
and things like that that go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: above crops, it's about a $4 billion
industry a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has declined a little bit since the
recession in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was higher back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among the various types of crops that
we grow, bedding plants, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals and perennials that are grown
primarily in the spring and sold in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and then are supposed to be
transplanted into your landscape or
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into hanging baskets and
containers and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they make up about $2 billion or about
half of the US floriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will be the crops that I'm going
to primarily focus on a little bit with
[SPEAKER_00]: potting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potted plants as well, which would be
things like poinsettias and orchids that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're more enjoying inside our house and
then throwing away once they look ugly,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York State's floriculture industry
has about 600 production operations with a
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale value approaching $200 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 568 acres of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our national ranking has varied from
about fifth to eighth since I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends on the year and how
well New York growers did and as that
[SPEAKER_00]: compares to the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have six good weekends of sales
in April and May and early June,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can really improve the economic
value, even the wholesale value,
[SPEAKER_00]: of our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to put it into context, if you look at
the other agriculture commodities in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State, the top four or so are all
related to the dairy industry pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either milk or feedstocks to support
the milk production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then apples would be number five and
floriculture would be number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is why study abiotic
stress tolerance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll back up and take kind of this
holistic worldwide perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about the increasing
worldwide scarcity of resources such as
[SPEAKER_00]: water, arable land, and then fossil fuels,
which we need to either heat greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: or run farm equipment or bring things to
market, fossil fuels are also the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: for petrochemicals, which are used heavily
in agriculture and horticulture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, global climate change
means that we're having these more erratic
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and more erratic water
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, if we have plants that are
more resistant to any of these stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they be drought or heat,
maybe cold stress, if we could grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a greenhouse, with less heat and
allow it to be colder, this would improve
[SPEAKER_00]: our situation in terms of producing more
crops using resources more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought this was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from the UN, the projected world
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently at seven billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could go probably following the
kind of medium thought by the UN is that
[SPEAKER_00]: this would go up to nine billion in fairly
short order and peaking out at about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: billion or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you look at kind of a worst
case scenario for world population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be increasing just as fast over
the next 100 years as it has for the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so besides the population growing to
nine billion by 2040, the UN tells us that
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2030, beyond population growth,
we're going to have three billion more
[SPEAKER_00]: middle class consumers, which means people
that can afford to eat either more
[SPEAKER_00]: calories or more calories as meat or other
high quality food stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to need to be able to
produce 50% more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet with this, we're going to need 45%
more energy to do that and 30% more water
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be talking about abiotic
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm going to do that is I'm
not an entomologist or a pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't work with insect stresses or
virus stresses or disease stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but essentially things like salinity,
drought, heat, chilling, freezing,
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding, nutrients, whether they're
inadequate or they're excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was someone's hanging basket that
they killed because of drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they put a couple of skulls on it
to decorate it for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might ask, when do floriculture
crops exhibit abiotic stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing them in these nice,
perfect greenhouse environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would argue that the plants are
potentially experiencing stress at many
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages throughout their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, yes, in the production stage
in the greenhouse, whether the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: forgets to irrigate them or doesn't want
to irrigate them as much as they like,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the greenhouse gets excessively
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the summertime, when the sun does
come out, greenhouses heat up very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They trap in heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there's been a look by farmers
trying to use minimally heated or unheated
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, simple structures such as
high tunnels for growing greenhouse crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done some research in that area
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have plants that can handle
chilling stresses or freezing stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: during production, that would be helpful
for them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides just the greenhouse production
stage, then you can look at the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my daughter and I walked into Walmart
last spring, and we saw these nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Impatients hanging baskets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked my four-year-old daughter,
OK, what's wrong with the plant on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, daddy, does it need more
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yes, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is, about half of the
floriculture products that we sell are
[SPEAKER_00]: marketed through these big box stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get there, very little
attention is paid to caring for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a large grower that I spoke to in
Michigan said that if he sells his plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into large supermarkets, he says if they
don't sell them within three days at the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket, they pretty much go into the
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so despite the fact that you could
theoretically continue to water this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, to fertilize this plant,
and care for it before it gets purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: by a consumer and brought to their house,
it just isn't happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we could add some days on to the
shelf life of that plant, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then of course, in the landscape
or like in this hanging basket,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially once the product gets to the
consumer, if we can make it last longer
[SPEAKER_00]: and make it more enjoyable for them,
we're more likely to engage the public in
[SPEAKER_00]: buying floriculture products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at why it's important to
improve the abiotic stress tolerance in
[SPEAKER_00]: floriculture crops, you could think of
kind of the short-term maybe current
[SPEAKER_00]: grower mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be to improve
profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have plants more resistant to
stress or these problems, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce crop losses or get away with a
higher quality crop even though maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: old-fashioned petunia variety that from 20
years ago may not have put up with that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stress and may have died quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow us to reduce inputs such as
water, fertilizer, and energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve consumer success with their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, I kind of look at it more as
the long-term survival of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in light of all of these declining
resources worldwide, floriculture is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need to compete against agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if our society looks at, okay,
we need fruit and vegetables and grain
[SPEAKER_00]: crops because we eat them, we may not need
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be this perception as flours
as a luxury item.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's competing resources,
a luxury item is going to eventually lose
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your thoughts in the audience
here today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are flours a luxury item?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no right answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends where they are, if they're in
your house or in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're well-fed every day, then you're
not thinking so much about your caloric
[SPEAKER_00]: intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're not so much a luxury
item.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would counter some of the arguments
with, okay, so flours are a luxury item.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about fresh tomatoes in New York in
January?
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be several months of the year
where our ancestors lived on root
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growing these crops somewhere else
or in a heated greenhouse could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: luxury item.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bananas year-round in the US,
grain-fed meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could go even farther and
think about what are all of the ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: we spend our carbon footprint,
like driving a car to work every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a plane to go to our annual
conferences, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, I think there's not this
black and white area where flour should be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled a luxury item, but it's more of
this gray scale of how does our society
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize how we allocate the resources
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would argue that we all know that
flours beautify our surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Alex mentioned, if they're outdoors,
there's research that shows that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape a house properly, it can
increase the resale value by as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that we've had houses sitting
on the market for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well-landscaped house apparently sells
six weeks sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a real economic value
associated with them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at plants in an indoor
environment, you can look at dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: papers that find specific benefits such as
they reduce the carbon dioxide in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment, they reduce the
volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One study found worker productivity was
increased 12% if there were X number of
[SPEAKER_00]: houseplants per square feet of office
space, and likewise reduced employee sick
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work with hospitals finds decreased length
of hospital stays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all very real economic values
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I were to summarize my research
program over the past five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: the central theme could be abiotic stress
tolerance, and then there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of it that I've looked
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple I'm not really going to focus
on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertilizers and fertilizer use
efficiency with either conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers or organic fertilizers has
been a large part of my research program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll save that for a different
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, I've collaborated with Chris Wein
to look at growing bedding plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: unheated high tunnels and you know sort of
sorting out which species and cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: are more successful under those conditions
and which ones are not and what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the length the lengthening of the
crop production time that it might take
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are the effects of plant quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead we're going to focus just on
these three primary topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll start by looking at screening
for cell tolerance and then we'll move on
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at exogenous compounds to improve
tolerance and then finally some molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first screening for salt and drought
tolerance and why the focus on drought and
[SPEAKER_00]: salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the abiotic stress tolerance I
talk about will be drought and salt
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, but not all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some different stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agriculture accounts for 70% of global
water use and irrigated land is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents only about 20% farmland,
but it supplies 42% of the world's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you know very efficient land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of production yields,
saline soils also represent 7% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world land area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're looking at needing this
increasing amount of arable land or land
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can access to increase our food
supply by 50%, we're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: better at growing crops either on saline
soils or using saline irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases drought and salt stress
might be thought of as having similar
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the effects would be osmotic
effects or you know high salt
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in the soil makes it
difficult for roots to extract enough
[SPEAKER_00]: water to meet the needs of the top part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be thought of as a
physiological drought, so wilting shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, reduced leaf surface area,
and then the responses of the plant such
[SPEAKER_00]: as stomatal closure or an increase in
reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on the type of salt
that you're looking at, certainly there
[SPEAKER_00]: can be more salt specificities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be seen you know like the
cell damage here, which could be due to
[SPEAKER_00]: excess accumulation of sodium and chloride
leading to cell wall disruption and
[SPEAKER_00]: previous to that enzyme disruption and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first person in my lab was Gonzalo
Villarino.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started as a master's student,
now he's a PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: His first project with me was to screen 14
of the most popular bedding plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: salt tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to see okay of the plants that
were growing, how problematic is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using this developed some
practical guidelines for greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end Gonzalo selected 14 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones highlighted in red could be
thought of as among the kind of top 10
[SPEAKER_00]: floriculture crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple that aren't in the
top 10 that we didn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially had seedlings that we
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we transplanted them and grew them on
for five weeks, exposing them to sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride in the irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ranged from zero up to 80
millimolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could look at their growth in
terms of relative dry weight for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be looking at the dry weight
of a zero millimolar plant and then what
[SPEAKER_00]: is the corresponding percent reduction in
relative dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do that then you can look at
all of the plants together and see which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are the most tolerant to this
particular salt stress and which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do this type of equilibration
then you're looking at okay maybe petunias
[SPEAKER_00]: are a much larger plant to start with than
pansy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's difficult to look at you know
the shape of the curve and how sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found is, yes Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every watering did, so it was a pretty
excessive continually adding more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did take weekly pour through leachate
values to look at what was the pH and what
[SPEAKER_00]: was the electrical conductivity inside of
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that after a couple
of weeks we got a pretty stable EC in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that because we applied a bit
excess irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we watered we leached a
little bit of water and it also leached
[SPEAKER_00]: out a bit of soluble salts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at just a few of the plants,
so we found snapdragon and petunia were
[SPEAKER_00]: among the most tolerant that adding this
80 millimolar sodium chloride after five
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks they were about half the size of
control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there were some plants like pansy
which were all dead at the end of the five
[SPEAKER_00]: week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So snapdragons will be representative of
the tolerant group and they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: mannitol or a carbohydrate that can act as
an osmo protectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pansies are very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selvia were quite sensitive and begonia
you know kind of intermediate in their
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity and tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end we came up with this
grouping where the most tolerant species
[SPEAKER_00]: we said had their dry weight reduced by 50
to 70 percent with 80 millimolar sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are somewhat artificial but you
know we looked at the 14 species and were
[SPEAKER_00]: there kind of some obvious groups that
came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat tolerant plants, moderately
sensitive and then the extremely sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were zinia and pansy which had 100
percent mortality at high salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity now peas are not a
floriculture crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess sweet peas are a floriculture
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a visiting scientist from
Pakistan last year and prior to that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: met him virtually and had gotten to serve
as a member of his graduate committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been looking at the effect of salt
stress on peas and initially did screening
[SPEAKER_00]: studies to look at which pea genotypes
were more tolerant and what were some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the underlying reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he went on to look at some
exogenous applications of compounds to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve that tolerance and I'll talk about
that in a minute as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pea is apparently an important crop in
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important for the food of their
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan as well as 11th in the world in
pea production producing 84,000 tons on
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 hectares and they also have
problems with salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently 20 percent of their arable land
is affected by salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the work that he did is initially
screening these 30 pea genotypes to sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride in the irrigation water and that
was added to achieve thresholds of 0,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.55 or 7.5 deciSiemens per meter so
they'll be measured with an electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually from those 30 he chose two
that were quite salt tolerant and
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of that group and two that
were quite sensitive and representative of
[SPEAKER_00]: that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he further went on to look at
some of the morphology and physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with their resistance and their
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to highlight a couple of his
interesting findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Ambassador and PF400 which were
salt sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have two cultivars Climax and
Samarina Zard which were tolerant and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at plant dry weight in response to
increasing salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found that the most tolerant
cultivars showed very little decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas there was this quite linear,
quite strong decrease in plant dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: for the sensitive cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very similar pattern was found as well
for seed weight and for yield of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm not going to show those graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially just by selecting from
existing cultivars you could choose plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more able to be used on these
saline soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graphs can be difficult to read but
it's sodium content in the roots on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left side and the leaves on the right
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he found is that the two most
tolerant cultivars actually accumulated a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sodium in their roots but that did
not get translocated to their leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end the sensitive cultivars
accumulated a lot of sodium in their
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that sort of trapped or
held by the roots or just not,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had selectivity in their
translocation and did not translocate that
[SPEAKER_00]: to their leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a suite of antioxidant enzymes was
looked at and we talked about with the
[SPEAKER_00]: salt or increasing salt and drought stress
you would expect the plant to respond by
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing its antioxidant enzyme content
and expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that the sensitive
cultivars really did not do that to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be the dark blue bar and
the red bar really minor kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: increments in their antioxidant enzyme
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the more tolerant cultivars that
seems to be a decently large mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in their tolerance they were able
to almost double the antioxidant enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is superoxide dismutase but that
is representative of several other of the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that he looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another mechanism for salt tolerance can
be we talked about osmo protectants and so
[SPEAKER_00]: glycine and beta-ene was one of the
osmolytes that was looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a quite similar story as the
antioxidant enzymes where it really did
[SPEAKER_00]: not increase too much of a degree for the
sensitive plants but the tolerant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to high salts doubled the amount
of osmolytes that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion from that work was that
salt stress significantly reduced these
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes that we looked at growth and
yield and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the salt tolerance potential of P
genotypes is highly linked with a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of these traits and that was osmolytes and
antioxidant enzymes as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted movement of sodium chloride
from the roots to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you were selecting, if you were
going back to screen 30 genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 genotypes of peas and looking at which
ones were tolerant to salt these would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be good characteristics to look
at as indicators for salt tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that I want to look at exogenous
compounds that can improve tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could think about okay is there
something that I can spray on my plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to my plant that can make it
withstand this stress better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my colleague in Pakistan has looked
at Brasino steroids and I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from the steroid class of hormones
and they apparently improve membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: stability and osmotic adjustment and also
have effects on gene signaling and
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing the plant defense system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second project I'll talk about was with
seaweed or kelp extract, a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: product called Stimplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have high concentration of
betaenes which are acting as osmolytes but
[SPEAKER_00]: it really contains hundreds of compounds
and we're just beginning to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: which of those hundreds of compounds are
important in the stress tolerance benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last is silicon which is
considered a beneficial nutrient but not
[SPEAKER_00]: an essential nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it apparently mediates systemic
resistance by the plant, does have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on antioxidant enzyme expression
and membrane stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll delve into those a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bit more with Adnan's work and he's
gotten 50 pages written on this in his PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: thesis but to summarize this simply,
one experiment that he did with this
[SPEAKER_00]: Brasino steroid was soak seeds with a
Brasino steroid or not soak them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Brasino steroid prior to salt stress and
he did that as a seed soaking treatment as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used one millimolar sodium chloride
and 10 millimolar sodium chloride whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of Brasino steroid that he used
was applied at 10 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the plant dry weight,
now I don't have significance bars in here
[SPEAKER_00]: to make things brief but essentially,
so if you soaked the seeds in salt that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced their dry weight, if you soaked
them in the Brasino steroid first and then
[SPEAKER_00]: with salts, you could enhance the dry
weight even above the control dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also got treatments where he just
used the Brasino steroid and their dry
[SPEAKER_00]: weight was even greater than within these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at several different
parameters that were associated with that
[SPEAKER_00]: and he found that the Brasino steroids did
improve the activity of the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant enzymes, increased
photosynthetic parameters and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be a potentially useful tool
in mitigating that salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple Chinese scientists that
looked with this commercial extract of
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp and looking at whether this
alleviated salt stress in petunia,
[SPEAKER_00]: verbena, tomato and snapdragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what we did is we grew
these seedlings, we transplanted them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of similar to Gonzalo's work,
we gave them salt continuously in the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water and that was 40
millimolar salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have noted here is that we have
the treatments are without sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride, and then those are minus stem
plex or the kelp extract or plus stem
[SPEAKER_00]: plex, which is that kelp extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have plus 40 millimolar sodium
chloride, but without the kelp extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus sodium chloride and with that kelp
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, we saw this trend for
all four species, but with petunia and
[SPEAKER_00]: verbena, it was significant for all of the
treatments is that if we have control
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, so not exposed to salt,
so that would be like the blue bar on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left, if we then expose them to weekly
drenches of stem plex, which was applied
[SPEAKER_00]: at five milliliters per liter of this
commercial preparation, we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant increase in the dry weight of
the plant and this could relate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokinins potentially in it or other
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we take a plant that is exposed to
40 millimolar sodium chloride,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like this petunia in the green bar,
you see that its growth is much reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to plants that didn't get salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we add this stem plex, this kelp
extract, we saw a significant increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: its dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not enough to get it anywhere back
close to the control dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a pretty severe salt stress
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we saw with petunia and verbena.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we looked at was
response for some of the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at just net photosynthetic
rate, what we found, and I apologize for
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes in color, but the setup is
very similar, is that plants that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with salt but received this kelp
extract had a greatly increased
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we looked at plants that had
been treated with salt and then we looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at their photosynthetic rate, we did not
see any significant differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be at that point,
the cells were so impaired that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: not this particular improvement of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite interesting that even control
plants, not treated with salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but got this kelp extract, had improved
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also started some trials where we've
grown these plants in a greenhouse with
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly drenches of kelp extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we bring them to kind of a
simulated retail environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just indoors, water them once,
and then we let them wilt as they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that, so this is a tomato five
days with no water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our control plant, if you can see,
looks somewhat more wilted than our kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: extract treated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're repeating that research right
now with a new visiting Chinese scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna look at that in petunia
and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of you have heard me speak before
in silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of silicon as a potentially
beneficial nutrient has been a topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest for some years now in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And silicon is naturally found in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants absorb silicon as salicylic acid,
which is SiO4H4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a single unit of silicon surrounded by
four oxygens and four hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that have looked at,
okay, what elements are necessary for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to complete its life cycle,
as far as they've been able to exclude
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon out of, say, hydroponic solutions
and look at it, they've never been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove that silicon was absolutely needed
for higher plants to complete their life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find that there's a lot of reports,
rice was a good example, that rice
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulates something like five to 10% of
its dry weight is silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's even more than nitrogen,
which is the essential nutrient that it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes in the greatest quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you farmed rice in the same field
for several decades, the soil can become
[SPEAKER_00]: depleted of the silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started seeing plants that
were more prone to getting diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they supplemented that soil back
with silicon, either like a potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate or calcium silicate, or just by
returning, say, rice hulls back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, that they would see this beneficial
response to disease tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this growing body of research
that the same is true with various abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with floriculture crops, we're
typically growing them in a potting mix
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't expect a lot of silicon to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's peat and perlite and some added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found when we looked at the soil
of substrates that we've used,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have about 0.08 millimolar
silicon in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tap water at Cornell has a little bit
of silicon as an impurity in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 0.03 millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fertilizers might have a little bit of
impurity in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wonder, OK, is that enough silicon
impurity that if we add more silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to have any effect on the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the opposite true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it beneficial to add this supplemental
silicon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we grew 21 floriculture
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them 10 weekly drenches of either
zero or four million millimolar silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: from potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at leaf tissue silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be hard to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 21 species that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that their leaf silicon
content varied from petunia on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was unamended with potassium
silicate, it had a concentration of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we amended it with silicon,
that did go up to 500 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to plants like verbena or
geranthum and tyrannia, which had up to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 4,000 or 4,500 parts per million
silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, the dark bars refer to plants
that were unamended with silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the open bars are plants that were
amended with silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see examples, especially some of
the silicon-accumulating plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did amend them with silicon,
we see fairly dramatic increases in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf tissue levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a broad group of plants
down here that accumulate fairly low
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this tuberous begonia,
if we add silicon to the potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate to the soil, there was no further
enhancement of leaf tissue silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at which plants showed a
significant increase in their leaf silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: content once we added it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so interesting that petunia,
which had such low levels of silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it was amended or not,
but if we did amend it, it absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: something like 130% more silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: than the unamended soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured several morphological
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simple things like just flower
diameter, height of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: stem diameter, dry weight, fresh weight,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially found some very subtle
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing hugely dramatic with silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, there were statistically
significant differences where,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, flower diameter was maybe 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: wider when we had silicon, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that cultivars within a
species can vary in their
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon-accumulating ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found like geraniums, for example,
one cultivar that accumulated more silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: when we added it, and another that did
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, what we found is that
in the absence of stresses, silicon did
[SPEAKER_00]: not really have a dramatic effect on plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about that time, there was this
growing body of research that indeed most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the benefits of silicon are when you
have some external stress, whether that be
[SPEAKER_00]: biotic or abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a postdoc that I had a few years ago
looked at the role of silicon in
[SPEAKER_00]: poinsettia post-harvest performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poinsettia is the second largest
potted crop in the US, which was recently
[SPEAKER_00]: overtaken by phalaenopsis orchids,
or just orchids in general, a couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he did,
which I'm not going to really show you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that he grew plants in the greenhouse
with different amounts of irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100% of their needs, 80% of their
needs, or 60% of their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so of course, if you grow a plant with
less water than it's taking up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he found is
that adding silicon in as weekly drenches
[SPEAKER_00]: into these treatments is that this
reduction in, say, leaf surface area or
[SPEAKER_00]: brack surface area when the plant was only
given 60% of its water needs is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw some recovery in the brack surface
area and some recovery of the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area when we added silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we did is we took
these plants into, again, a simulated
[SPEAKER_00]: retail environment, so the post-harvest
environment, watered them once and then
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't water them again, and looked at how
long it took them to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that the, especially for plants
that received 100% of their irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, that if we added silicon,
it took them longer to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's reflected here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a larger leaf angle means a more wilted
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A leaf closer to 90 degrees would be a
completely wilted leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so interesting that of the treatment,
so plus or minus silicon in 60%,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80%, or 100% of their irrigation needs,
the plants that had the lowest leaf angle
[SPEAKER_00]: were the silicon treated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that had wilted the most was
especially the silicon treated plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: had gotten 100%, or not silicon,
with 100% of its water needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the plants wilt, and then we
rewatered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found there was some qualitative
benefit, at least, to having silicon for
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: My current postdoc, Mikkel Moyal,
has looked more at silicon effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: Petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the work I'm going to talk
about for the rest of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it relates to Petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like Petunia because it's the
largest bedding plant for wholesale value
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been a genetic model for
floriculture species for some 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that has become because it's
relatively easy to transform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get transgenic plants and look
at the effects of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's decently easy to handle in tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found somewhere work that
Gonzalo did in hydroponics, just like work
[SPEAKER_00]: that he did in soil, found reductions in
Petunia growth with increasing sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know if silicon would
improve Petunia's salt tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Mikkel did treatments with silicon
at 0, 2, or 4 millimolar, supplied his
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly drenches, evaluated the plants
after seven weeks, and they received a
[SPEAKER_00]: salt stress all along of 0 up to 80
millimolar sodium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she found is that the primary effects
on the plants were the salinity effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this table doesn't include silicon,
but something like the shoot dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing from 37 to 13 grams as sodium
chloride increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very little kind of silicon
interaction with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she looked a little deeper,
though, we could see kind of some very
[SPEAKER_00]: subtle indications that silicon was having
benefits to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we looked at leaf area,
we have plants that received 0,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, or 4 millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blue bars would be 0
millimolar sodium chloride up to purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be 80 millimolar sodium
chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found in terms of statistical
significance, if we didn't have silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have that 80 millimolar sodium
chloride, we saw a reduction in leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had silicon either at 2 or 4
millimolar, that statistical significance
[SPEAKER_00]: goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a pattern of reduction,
but it wasn't large enough to be
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant in our
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured chlorophyll index,
and the lower leaves were interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the lower leaves, we saw a reduction
in chlorophyll index when we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon at 80 millimolar sodium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the 2 and 4 millimolar
sodium chloride treatments, we did not see
[SPEAKER_00]: a significant reduction at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it apparently helped to preserve the
integrity of chlorophyll, potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane integrity, in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mikkel wanted to know if this would
carry on through to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she looked at these are plants
treated with 80 millimolar sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride, and then they have silicon
supplemented at 0, 2, and 4 millimolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found is a pattern of
increased net photosynthesis where we had
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With transpiration, or the rate of water
loss out of the leaves, we saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction, but not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when she multiplied the 2 to get
predicted water use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the net CO2 that's fixed per year,
unit of water that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you combine the two, we do get this
statistically significant trend that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have improved water use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's very much in line with the
previous work that we had with the drought
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance in the poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikkel has also exposed petunia to heat
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heat stress we see in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely see in the landscape,
especially in the southern half of the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: She initially exposed petunia to 35
degrees Celsius or 40 degrees Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously for either 24 hours,
72 hours, and then after 72 hours pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and looked at recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is we have wilt index here
on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have heat exposure and then
the recovery period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that plants that the silicon
treated plants after one day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: significant after 72 hours and significant
in the recovery period had significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: less wilt than their control counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with 35 degrees Celsius, we saw that
trend at 72 hours, but in the end was not
[SPEAKER_00]: a significant trend by the time we got to
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the picture here, the left would be the
silicon treated plants at 40 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the right would be the plants that did
not get silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She followed that up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with 40 degrees Celsius plants,
she measured their leaf temperature prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to their stress and then 24 and 72 hours
into the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she found a significant reduction in
leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that relates to she watered the
plants well throughout the period,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe they have some improved cooling
capacity with the silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chlorophyll fluorescence or FV over
FM, a measure of efficiency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plants on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three different colored bars were
control two and four millimolar silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: before they got 40 degrees Celsius stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after two days of that stress,
what we found is that the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have silicon, the controls,
their efficiency was quite reduced where
[SPEAKER_00]: reductions were not so severe when they
had two or four millimolar silicon during
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant production phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use existing compounds,
whether they're beneficial nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp extract or so on, and improve stress
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on a moment molecular
techniques to improve tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work that McKell's currently doing
is in rice, they know the two carrier
[SPEAKER_00]: genes in the roots that are responsible
for active silicon uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, those genes have mostly been
found in Gramminaceous species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one case of a dicot where they
found a silicon uptake carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in cucurbit, which is about 1%
by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: By comparison, rice was 5% or 10% silicon
by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petunia is about 0.02, 0.05% by dry
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what McKell has done is cloned
these rice silicon transporters and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: generated transgenic petunia lines with
the transporter 1, or LSI 1, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter 2, LSI 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk in a minute about work that
she's doing screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant just has overexpressed LSI 1 or
just has overexpressed LSI 2, if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular stress benefit, the other thing
that she's doing is now working on crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: of these plants to obtain a homozygous
line that has single transgenic copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at, OK, if you have the
combination of the two carriers together,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that give you a further enhancement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, so essentially, McKell did qPCR
and found that she had about a dozen lines
[SPEAKER_00]: each for LSI 1 and LSI 2 of plants that
were enhanced in their relative
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bars are kind of misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with LSI 1 in this top graph here,
we have plants that have 7 times the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of actin all the way up to
plants that have, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 9,000, 20,000 times the expression as a
housekeeping gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a similar story for LSI 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, she was successful in
obtaining a range of transgenic lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: varied in their expression levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those LSI 1 overexpressed plants,
we grew them in a greenhouse with
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental either 0.0 0.5 or 2
millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting thing is some of the
highly expressing lines at 2 millimolar
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon, we could see a bit of
phytotoxicity if you see that leaf in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, if we look at the silicon content
in the tissue, we don't see a particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially at 2 millimolar silicon,
we don't see a significant difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the silicon content of those leaves as
compared to a 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something maybe related to the,
we use 35S as the promoter for the gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a root specific promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the silicon content,
we did see that for our transgenic plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with no silicon amended at all,
they statistically had the same silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: content levels as a wild type plant with
0.5 millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transgenic plants with 0.5
millimolar silicon statistically had the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of silicon in them as a wild
type plant with 2 millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one potential benefit of these plants
is they could be better posed to scavenge
[SPEAKER_00]: the silicon that is existing in the soil
and not having to apply exogenous silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: to obtain the same benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did screen five of the lines to
heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she found that there was significant
reduction in wilt index for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's just started now to look at some
of the explanations for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has shown, for example,
a lower leaf temperature, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the transgenic lines, even at 0.5
millimolar silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for wild type plants, it took at
least 2 millimolar silicon to see those
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to point out, Michele is
collaborating with Dr. Andre Kessler in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecology and evolutionary biology
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michele has a background in analyzing
volatiles in plants and manipulating that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking at a cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding it three different types
of herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're giving it three different types
of herbivores and with or without silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at a bivari or damage to
the leaf, as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprint of the volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compounds that are given off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very much in its preliminary
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to mention my grad student,
Gonzalo, is working on my PhD with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the projects that he's looking
at, it's one of the chapters in his PhD,
[SPEAKER_00]: is exploiting the trealose pathway to
improve salt and drought tolerance of
[SPEAKER_00]: petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pathway that's previously
been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the past, so we have some
intermediates to trehalose, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of the potential bottlenecks,
the enzymes that mediate those would be
[SPEAKER_00]: TPS and TPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, people have looked at
overexpressing TPS in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found an improved salt tolerance
and drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we want to do is look at,
OK, is the combination of both required?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we get a more efficient response if
they're both required or if we add them
[SPEAKER_00]: both together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And using petunia as our model species,
the petunia genome hasn't been sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using tomato as a reference genome,
Gonzalo was able to clone TPS and TPP
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully from petunia and sequence
them and confirm their function in a yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adds a bit to our knowledge on
petunia genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's added those into the NCBI
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, we're looking at does the
expression of TPS and TPP improve salt and
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do either of the genes alone work or
combined?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they more efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as there's this growing body of
evidence that the total amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: trehalose that is accumulated isn't so
important that it's acting more as a
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling molecule as opposed to in
primitive plants, a large amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: trehalose can accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, it's acting as an
osmo-protectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to sort out, OK, are benefits
related to more signaling or to that
[SPEAKER_00]: osmo-protection?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would just conclude by
saying tackling these world problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: resource shortages is going to take all of
our combined efforts to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, this integrated approach
of there's room for people to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: production practices that use these
resources efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about screening and other
people during breeding of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate stress, exogenous compounds that
we can use to enhance stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, these molecular
approaches are rewarding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll ask if there's any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had thought one of my hypotheses
was, OK, maybe for the silicon benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: with heat stress or drought stress or cell
stress, something like that, maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the plant to use water more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does seem to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, there's some underlying reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less transpiration from the
leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think there'd be less of a loss of
that heat energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like there's some other
mechanism that's taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a great hypothesis for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there was actually sort of a
biophysicist looking at the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found if there were decent
cuticular deposits of silicon that they
[SPEAKER_00]: acted as kind of this heat sink of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that case, it was very much a
physical kind of benefit of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cuticular deposits in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't looked at that at all for
any of the species that I've looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: with silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, could some of the
silicon benefits be reflectance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have less energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd reflect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would certainly follow through
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not familiar with literature
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For gramminaceous plants that accumulate a
lot of silicon, one of the benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about is a physical
benefit of having a more upright plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that can sometimes intercept more light
for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different kind of phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just that reflectance itself will be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, do the plants look
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I can tell from wild type plants
that I've treated with silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot really discern differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: With poinsettias, I could find slightly
thicker stems when they were treated with
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting for me for Mikkel,
one of the transgenic lines that she had
[SPEAKER_00]: that was highly expressing LSI1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see a more erect kind of petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wild type is more of this sprawling
kind of petunia form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the transgenic lines was
decently more erect, which I would say had
[SPEAKER_00]: a firmer stem and a wider stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, there was, at least in
this transgenic case, a morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say probably rice starved of
silicon compared to rice given plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see those type of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the reason we jumped to
trehalose was we knew it had worked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in saying, OK,
I'm a floriculturist, but demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can use molecular biology
techniques in a floriculture crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are some interesting
questions related to the trehalose pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't answered even in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we could
potentially contribute to the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of Gonzalo's chapters is going to be a
lumina high throughput sequencing of
[SPEAKER_00]: petunias with and without cell stress for
varying lengths of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be very much like what
you're talking about, where looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing body and seeing which genes are
highly involved in cell tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll get there, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that sense, realizing that the
toolkit that we have with Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_00]: with knockouts that exist, and our genome
that has been fully sequenced and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: will help us move forward to answer those
questions more directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonzalo and I talk about that a lot,
whether transgenic floriculture crops
[SPEAKER_00]: might be more accepted by the public than
transgenic food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a conference in the Netherlands a
couple of weeks ago, and some colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: there were saying that the public there is
quite resistant to GMOs in whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they eat it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet in Japan, we have the first case of a
transgenic flower, a so-called blue rose,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is now licensed there on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is apparently available in the US
now, although I've never seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, if you want to get a
transgenic crop, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend something, what was it, several
hundred million dollars, Peter would have
[SPEAKER_00]: answers to that, to go through the hoops
of showing this is a safe, a plant to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in its given case, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those obstacles, if you look at
floriculture crops compared to corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: petunia, which is the largest value
bedding plant, is worth $200 million a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one's going to spend $100 million in
hoops in trying to get a transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least we don't have to do feeding
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'd still have to do pollinator
trials, and then, OK, are the petunia in
[SPEAKER_00]: the landscape that the gene could spread
to, and do you need male sterility,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, it's a ways off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we ever get to a more
streamlined procedure where they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, if you're a floriculture crop,
not a food crop, you only have to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through these hurdles and made that more
efficient, I think we could get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Neil, thank you very much.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
