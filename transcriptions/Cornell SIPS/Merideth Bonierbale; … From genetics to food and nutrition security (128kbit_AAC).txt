[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice to be here and I think I
do call it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halle Tufan invited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're part of a shared program now between
the International Potato Center and a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of other international CGIR
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appeared to me to be a really nice
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only regret is that I'm only here for
two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday I made a great visit to the
Field House and I saw that potato breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and wheat breeding and barley breeding are
still in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I want to just select for you a
few of the topics in which we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with in SIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been there for 20 years and as
Walter said I'm leading a breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: for potato but we also have a sweet potato
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: My area is called a science division for
genetics, genomics and crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really glad to hear that you're
going to open your own SIPs very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be talking to you about one
SIPs and then I look forward to seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: your own new SIPs goes on in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the the vision of SIP like many or
all of the other CGIR centers is to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to improving the life of the
poor and our mandate crops are potato and
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned to you we also work
besides in crop improvement we work in a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of other disciplines from natural
resource management to social and health
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our program now is arranged into these
three science divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of breeding we have a breeding
program for potato with its headquarters
[SPEAKER_00]: in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a potato breeder in Kenya and
we're looking for one in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the case of sweet potato we have a
breeder in India as well as Peru and three
[SPEAKER_00]: in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a global program that we lead
and we rely very heavily on genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and also the diverse
agroecologies in Peru to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-breeding populations that can then be
shared with national programs for variety
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the outline I had trouble
selecting a few topics that could fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: your short seminar series but I would like
to tell you about some recent advantages
[SPEAKER_00]: in enriching the mineral concentration of
potato which is a very nutritional crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to give you a few examples
of collaboration and particularly delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: of new heat tolerant generations of
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeting Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few I think that you're also
concerned for impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do work with impact specialists and
we're constantly having to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've done from the breeding program
and also learn from the successes or the
[SPEAKER_00]: failures to orient the long term
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I've heard that Eskimos
have many words for snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in Ithaca you do too but in Peru the
potato is a staple crop and it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: the diverse it has so many diverse uses
that it's really the lifeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just a few shots of potato
utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept year round for a food security
crop through a number of fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: drying processes as well as being grown in
mixtures for sustainable for substance use
[SPEAKER_00]: on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tremendous opportunity from
where we are in Peru to learn about potato
[SPEAKER_00]: and its cultivation from the knowledge of
the people who domesticated it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potato is also increasingly
becoming an important cash income crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa where it also is grown for
sustainability on isolated farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these circumstances some of the
traits that we breed into potatoes we call
[SPEAKER_00]: them sustainability or pro-poor traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very concerned with virus resistance
to sustain the ability for farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: either keep their seed or for seed growers
with limited infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have reliable seed to pass on to
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have historically concentrated
on resistance to late-life and viruses in
[SPEAKER_00]: our populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're working more on nutrition
and market traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the SIP was formed over 45 years ago
and in its inception the first major
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment was to collect genetic
resources and also to start a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative contracts particularly one
was with Cornell, one was with the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Wisconsin and others to
start a breeding program before the
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise was on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did develop two major populations
and these are agroecologically oriented
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can imagine that it's not
possible to have one potato with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything even if the Gates Foundation
might pay you to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two major populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the highland tropic late-light
resistant population which is oriented to
[SPEAKER_00]: humans in humid tropical conditions where
late-light pressure is present year round
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This population was started with a
collection of not only indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm but also breeding success of
other programs in US and Europe to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brought into a single population that has
now undergone three cycles of recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: selection and is of variety quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second population we've developed we call
it the lowland tropics virus resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a history of breeding
for the lowland tropics when Cornell was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the initial partners of SIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physiology department was dedicated
toward breeding for heat tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually when I arrived I figured that
there was a missing trait there it was
[SPEAKER_00]: virus resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the lowland tropic population
to add virus resistance from indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: using neo tuberosa material that also came
from Cornell and then introducing other
[SPEAKER_00]: virus resistant material particularly for
potato leaf roll virus from South American
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs and from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two populations we call them
advanced at this point and they're each
[SPEAKER_00]: comprised of a number of subpopulations
with different ecological targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently about 12 years ago we
started a biofortification breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program and so now we have our first
tetraploid generation of high iron and
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to select a few of the topics
from these breeding populations to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit of how we're working and
what kind of results we have had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that Peru is an incredibly
diverse country not only in terms of being
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of origin of the crop and its
genetic resources but also in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and we have the opportunity to work in
our research stations from sea level up
[SPEAKER_00]: until about 3,200 meters where our
highland station is located so we have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to very hot environments in the
jungle and very cold environments and also
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry and wet environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use these environments to screen our
populations and to make selections for
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-breeding and then we conduct our
stability analysis in certain areas here
[SPEAKER_00]: and in collaboration with national
programs in target regions which do have
[SPEAKER_00]: similar agroecologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main limitation is that we're in short
day environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently we took on the challenge of
breeding for the Central Asian area which
[SPEAKER_00]: is temperate and that's actually the
origin of our interest in heat tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: for high day temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also interested in the high
night temperatures of heat tolerance for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for mid-elevation regions of
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these diverse agroecologies and
experiment stations in Peru are very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for the initial screening that we
need to do when we still have a large
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of germplasm before it can be put
in vitro and moved to a target country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first topic that I want to discuss is
biofortification and we became a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Harvest Plus program starting in about
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Harvest Plus consortium as I think
that some of you know working on maize or
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava is an initiative to apply plant
breeding to increasing the micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of staple crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potato doesn't accumulate beta carotene
but it is a good source of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does accumulate other carotenoids which
are part of our breeding program but here
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to concentrate on enriching iron
and zinc concentration in potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deficiency of iron as you know is
causing a wide range public health
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anemia is particularly important as it
leads to maternal mortality and reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: learning capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc deficiency leads to the increase of
infections which are debilitating to human
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a picture of community work
in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field is usually opened by hand with
this ancient instrument, a chacritacria
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the potatoes are planted in one
of these methods in the rows that are
[SPEAKER_00]: opened up or can be covered just with sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru is one of the targets of our
biofortification program because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: high rate of potato consumption coincident
with anemia, high rates of anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the problem and why potato,
here I just have a few cases of the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: or the extent of anemia in some of our
additional target countries, Rwanda and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem affects particularly women of
childbearing age and when the population
[SPEAKER_00]: is expressing or having more than 25% of
anemia this becomes a public health
[SPEAKER_00]: problem for the reasons I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly for children it's a very,
very debilitating condition particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: during the first 1,000 days of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have found in exploring potato
and this is some recent result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, some recent result from our
collaboration with the Science Institute
[SPEAKER_00]: of Technology in Luxembourg is we started
to investigate not only the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity for iron and zinc content in
potato but also its bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been a number of crops
subject to this biofortification breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more successful is pearl millet
in addition to beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have a very, very high rate of
concentration of iron in the food but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not available to the human diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conducted a range of
bioaccessibility tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an in vitro test because we're not
yet ready for human study tests which
[SPEAKER_00]: would give us a bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to demonstrate the potato
is one of the very highest crops with
[SPEAKER_00]: about over 67% of its iron available for
digestion and use by the human diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from the other crops from
pearl millet to beans, soybeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: others, while they do contain plenty of
iron and that's in a non-heme form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it's a low bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potato has a high bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in setting our breeding goals,
we were instructed by the nutritionists in
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest Plus that we could use an estimate
of 10% bioavailability of iron in potato
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet our population breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for any of these other crops,
they have to assume that only 5% is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be available for the diet and therefore
their breeding goals must be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the traits that we're
working on in the nutrition breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're concentrating, as I mentioned,
primarily on enhancing iron and zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also concerned with other
compounds present in the food and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: diet, particularly vitamin C and
carotenoids which can favor the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability in the diet and phenolics
which can impede the bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the type of potato we're breeding in
this program should probably be yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: flesh and should probably not be purple
flesh, although in the purple flesh potato
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lot of other health enhancing
properties and the antioxidants and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a shot of the gene bank in
the background and some of the native
[SPEAKER_00]: potato germplasm that we began to screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a sample of our advanced
breeding material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know when we started this
program, is there genetic variability for
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and zinc concentration in the crop
because that hadn't been published before.
[SPEAKER_00]: To implement this breeding program,
we formed a new laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the Quality Nutrition Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that one of the students here
was at SIPP in this lab as a Borlaug
[SPEAKER_00]: Fellow because we didn't really know much
about these traits or how to measure them
[SPEAKER_00]: and most importantly how to avoid
contamination in the sample processing
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is an underground crop and
subject to many other sources of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we began using ICP as a technique to
quantify minerals in the potato
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and we did this through a
contract that was facilitated by Harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus with the Weight Analytical Services
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very expensive method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost us by a service contract $25 a
sample and we could only get about 50 done
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to get a permit and we sent this
to Australia as freeze dried ground potato
[SPEAKER_00]: or sweet potato tissue depending on our
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our biochemist then proceeded to work
with another Australian scientist to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop the capacity of XRF as a rapid
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to work in a breeding
program or even a germplasm screening
[SPEAKER_00]: program, you must be able to process
thousands of samples at your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so XRF is an inexpensive method for
quantifying minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adapted from the mining industry and
we can measure hundreds of samples a day
[SPEAKER_00]: for only $5 cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has made a tremendous increase in
our ability to pass our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: populations at an early stage through the
quality and nutrition lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started our screening program,
this just shows you some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: summarized data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked into both the native or land
race material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a case of iron and also our
subsets of advanced populations and we
[SPEAKER_00]: could see the frequency distribution of
concentration for iron in peeled potato
[SPEAKER_00]: tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a greater range and higher
levels, as I mentioned, of iron
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in the native germplasm and
particularly in certain groups of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a breakdown of the population
distribution for iron concentration and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that the foreha germplasm and
also some of the stenotum diploid
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm presents higher ranges of iron
than we were able to find in our advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in our advanced material,
which had never been screened for iron
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration before, we also found
genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected this material, we call it
the tops, and we're eventually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use these in our breeding program to
combine with the high iron sources from
[SPEAKER_00]: the native cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of zinc, we found the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same design on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of native materials and a
number of improved materials from our
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced breeding populations and we found
a wider range of zinc variation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: improved populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the native material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think as all of you know,
potato is a very good source of vitamin C
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found a wide range of vitamin C
concentration in potatoes, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: come from the Andean native gene pools or
the advanced gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three traits became the
objectives of our biofortification
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program and we're breeding for
increased concentration of iron and zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tubers with a background of high
vitamin C, which is a promoter of
[SPEAKER_00]: availability in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin the breeding program,
we conducted a North Carolina design too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made six sets of process and this is
just a design to show you how when you
[SPEAKER_00]: make a cross with, we made a cross with
one male and four females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is group one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we collect the tuber families and
this starts to give us unexpected genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this at the diploid level with the
highest sources of iron and zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that we found in our
germplasm screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of potato, we make
seedlings from the crosses and then what's
[SPEAKER_00]: shown on the bottom of these, each is a
tuber family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you an idea of the
genetic variability that can come from one
[SPEAKER_00]: cross between a diploid male and a diploid
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who are not
geneticists or don't believe in genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start to see some of the
phenotypes coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is group three and four and group
five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this became an incredible source of
genetic resources for screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started our recurrent
selection program with this as a base
[SPEAKER_00]: population for iron and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we made a genetic design to start
our program, we were also able to assess
[SPEAKER_00]: the combining ability of certain parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a shot with the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could find the combining ability or
parental value of the male and the
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could select the best parents
for making the genetic gain that we wish
[SPEAKER_00]: to have in our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, we found some of the
parents saying, same parents as we have
[SPEAKER_00]: circled here, I think are both showing
good general combining ability for iron
[SPEAKER_00]: and for zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So entering these materials into the
breeding program at the diploid level,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we selected because of the trait
source and also because we can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: faster genetic gains in potato at the
diploid as opposed to the tetraploid
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conducted three cycles of
recurrent selection, selecting in each
[SPEAKER_00]: generation for iron and zinc as well as
tuber number, tuber shape, and tuber
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this picture, we just have the
example of iron in which you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've made almost a double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you do the math, about a 40%
increase in iron concentration in potato
[SPEAKER_00]: at the diploid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our baseline, which was 20 parts per
million, now we have selections that are
[SPEAKER_00]: up over 40 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our breeding goal is still a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you more about our breeding
goal that we expect to have for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate impact on the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this slide may be a little bit
complicated, but I wanted to explain to
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit the implications of this
breeding program for nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the bottom table, we have our
baseline, the level for iron and zinc at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have different
biofortification levels that were achieved
[SPEAKER_00]: through breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that level one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the graphs, what we're showing
is the potato consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I mentioned, the
biofortification breeding objective is
[SPEAKER_00]: really targeted to populations who are
consuming the crop as a staple food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, it means that the
population of women and children are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually consuming more than 200 or up to
800 grams of potato a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latter is probably not a good
recommendation, but that's what you find
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Peruvian Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these series of graphs, one for iron
and one for zinc, are showing different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting on the left, for populations who
consume 100 grams of potato a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 grams, 300 grams, and 400 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the graph is showing the relative
contribution of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: biofortification levels to the estimated
average requirements of iron for the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding goal is to have nearly 50%
of the estimated average requirement of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient provided by the staple crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for populations such as in Rwanda and
in Bolivia and Peru, which do consume 400
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of potato a day, we are getting very
close to our breeding goal here with 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the estimated average requirement of
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we continue breeding, we may go
even higher if we reach this actual
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Harvest Plus program began,
it was expecting each crop to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, I think that there's been
a kind of a shift into co-breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: co-consumption, so that we feel that
potato not only is a good source of
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals to the diet, but also we've done
some preliminary experimentation to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that potato is most likely able to enhance
the availability of iron from other
[SPEAKER_00]: sources in the diet, like beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a country like Rwanda, where people
eat a mash of beans and potatoes together,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potato component of that diet is
probably making the bioavailability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: iron that's coming from the fasciolus
beans, otherwise bound by phenolic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just showing you in nutritional
terms what is the kind of impact that we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from this genetic game that we've
achieved at the diploid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to orient this breeding program
toward our targets, which are Ethiopia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Rwanda, we've conducted a number of
capacity building events.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in particular is working with a lab
in the Rwanda Agricultural Board,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the breeding program is receiving
materials from us and making selections
[SPEAKER_00]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for the researchers
there to be able to sample without
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination and to use the XRF machine,
which we've collaborated with SEAT on
[SPEAKER_00]: installing in Kigali, Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we produce manuals, which are very
detailed on the standard operation
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures for the Quality Nutrition Lab,
and then our experts are training in
[SPEAKER_00]: Rwanda for the use of these protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same for XRF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked again with Harvest Plus,
and we used the same XRF machine that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being used for bean breeding with SEAT and
installed in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to train some of the
researchers in the Rwanda Agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: Board to determine the iron and zinc
concentration by XRF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention, because I know some of
you are using ICP, which is the reference
[SPEAKER_00]: method I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This XRF method doesn't allow us to detect
contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked on a calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to go to the details of it,
but when we made the calibration to use
[SPEAKER_00]: XRF, we have to show that it reliably
predicts that mineral content
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that would be found by the
reference method, which was ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in ICP, we also get a range of
data, such as titanium, aluminum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and chromium, which are very important
indicators of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get this kind of information from
XRF, so we have to send our top samples
[SPEAKER_00]: still to another laboratory for a
reference test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be sure that when we get a
high value for iron concentration that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's free of aluminum, which can be coming
with the soil, or chromium, which can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant from the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a two-step process,
but installing this XRF in Rwanda has
[SPEAKER_00]: given the Rwanda population breeding
program ability to select in our Cycle 3
[SPEAKER_00]: of diploid biofortification, which was
sent as true seed population, and to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the local selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started to make the local
selections, of course, this is a new type
[SPEAKER_00]: of potato, because as I mentioned,
we started breeding with diploid native
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to raise awareness,
and we're doing a little bit of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a participatory variety
assessment with these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that both in Ethiopia and
Rwanda, there is a preference for very
[SPEAKER_00]: high dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have high dry matter, and the
flavors are exquisite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be good acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are not yet released varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to introduce the concept of a
novel type of potato in case in Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: as in Peru, the diploid potato could be a
breeding product in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to combine the genetic gains that
we made at the diploid level with the
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced populations, which have very good
levels of late-flight and virus
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, we've been conducting a 4x,
2x breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this slide, I just want to show you
some of the improved diploids here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected for iron and zinc,
and also the production of 2N gametes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which facilitates the crossing with
tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we selected, as I mentioned,
the top tetraploids that had previously
[SPEAKER_00]: been bred and selected for biotic and
abiotic stresses, as well as quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but happened to have rather high levels of
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call those the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made our 4x, 2x crosses,
crossing the tops from tetraploid
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-resistant material with the high
iron or zinc diploid material that also
[SPEAKER_00]: has 2N gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, we had a large number of
families, and we determined the diploidy
[SPEAKER_00]: largely by chloroplast counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rapid method to separate
diploids, and we did get some tetraploids,
[SPEAKER_00]: triploids, which is unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our goal of this breeding program were
twofold at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, we wanted to infuse the diploid
breeding program with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials from the tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also extracted dihaploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we enriched our diploid breeding
program by crossing with dihaploids from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tetraploid breeding program,
and we brought the iron trait to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, for global breeding,
the tetraploid population is the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the high iron and zinc trait,
although we think we have some preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: products from the diploid breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a rapid accelerated selection
program with the tetraploids after we
[SPEAKER_00]: separated diploid, triploid, and
tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we had to do to accelerate the
breeding program is we sort of replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: years by locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had two or up to three trials per
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: in different agroecologies of Peru so that
we could reduce the population size with
[SPEAKER_00]: our major selection traits, the same as I
mentioned before, for tuber number and
[SPEAKER_00]: tuber shape, as well as iron and zinc
concentration at each of these clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: selection generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the tetraploid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our materials, when it's transferred to
national programs outside of Peru,
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be put into tissue culture and free
from viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be a long-term process and an
expensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this breeding program, we also used
our quarantine greenhouses to maintain two
[SPEAKER_00]: pots of healthy tubers during the
selection process so that those at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the program, which is now, we have now
about 150 and we want to get down to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: elite clones from this tetraploid
generation with high levels of iron or
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc and to make them available as in
vitro plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an overview of the games that we
have been able to see in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of this tetraploid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the bottom, I have shown four
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is two different seasons in
the same location, but these are four
[SPEAKER_00]: field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the line in the below shows the
commercial material or the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we show the distribution of
the tops, which are reaching new levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and zinc at the tetraploid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our ultimate breeding product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue breeding at the
tetraploid level, but we're also screening
[SPEAKER_00]: these as the selection scheme showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also evaluating them for the virus
and late-flight resistance that was
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed by the tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to incorporate all these
traits into the new population,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will need a few more cycles of
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we do have our, this year for
September, we expect to have about 50
[SPEAKER_00]: selected tetraploids with these high
levels of iron or zinc and also having
[SPEAKER_00]: been screened at least for one season for
resistance to late-flight and viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I'm doing for time
because I'm only going to the second
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I wanted to shift now to Asia,
which I think is not really known as a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous potato producing population or
ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that you're aware of the
tremendous population pressure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for agriculture to improve farming
systems and diets in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very, very large percentage of the
world's population lives in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And South Asia is very dependent on
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our new programs we call the
Asia Bajal Potato for Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is trying to emphasize the fact
that potato is a relatively short season
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and relatively adaptable to highland
and lowland agroecologies and can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be inserted into many cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a case in Peru where we talk about
potato-based systems where potato is a
[SPEAKER_00]: staple crop, potato is not really a staple
crop in many countries in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some of our target countries,
Bangladesh and Nepal, there are several
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand acres and it is an
important vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a separate breeding target,
which is breeding for early maturity of
[SPEAKER_00]: potato, also still incorporating our
disease resistance into these
[SPEAKER_00]: heat-tolerant populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our selection sites in
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you recognize that
probably Bangladesh is known as a
[SPEAKER_00]: rice-eating culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice is the food security crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a tremendous need for income
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rice-breeding program in Bangladesh
is trying to breed for a shorter duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason they give for that is so
that they can allow the farmers to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a similar breeding objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want also to shorten the vegetative
period of potato to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly for the subtropical
lowlands, it's very important to have
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to viruses for sustainability
of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that this breeding objective
will allow a sustainable intensification
[SPEAKER_00]: of rice based systems and also contribute
to diversification of the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a scheme of some of the
systems that we find in the subtropical
[SPEAKER_00]: lowlands of Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are growing rice, rice and rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't grow rice and
sometimes they grow wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are interested in increasing the
utility of potato as a sandwich crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a kind of a rotation crop in between
these cereal cropping cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a very short growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides being short, there's a very small
period in Southwest Asia or Southeast Asia
[SPEAKER_00]: when the temperature is low enough to grow
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potato is a cool weather crop and it
usually requires about 18 degrees to
[SPEAKER_00]: tuberize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not very tolerant to temperatures
over 30 degrees during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this period, this is just showing a
little bit of temperature scheme in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southwest Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This period, which is for winter potato,
is actually getting shorter with climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an increasing pressure to build
heat tolerance into short duration potato
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, we're working on heat
tolerance at the tuberization stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some in vitro assays to be able
to select the best families for clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still need a lot more information
on whether the heat tolerance that's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary at the beginning of the planting
period is the same that's also needed for
[SPEAKER_00]: tuberization or for bulking in the
phenology of the potato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're breeding for heat tolerance,
we have a number of quality traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very important to monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a data summary from many
of our trials in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to show is the genetic
variability for dry matter content at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time as we see it reduced during high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are cumulative data from
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they are decreasing by latitude,
by altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, the tropical lowlands
of Peru is a warm environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potato grown there suffers from a
decrease in dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in our breeding populations,
we still have enough genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: between this high level and the low level
to select materials that still maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: upward of 18% dry matter, which is
required for potato quality, even under
[SPEAKER_00]: warm environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second trait that I think you're aware
of at least in potato is the accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of glycoalkaloids with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trait rather stabbed us in the back
because some of our elite materials that
[SPEAKER_00]: have already been recommended through our
catalog for use in the lowland tropics are
[SPEAKER_00]: high in glycoalkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, we're very interested in a
rapid assay because this is a rather
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive trait to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most breeding programs
evaluate it at the end to make sure that a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that's going to be released into
the market doesn't have more than 20 parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million of glycoalkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's recommended in breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the safe level at 20 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in breeding programs, it's recommended
not to have more than 10 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: because our materials may be used in
environments where they're not screened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows a number of elite clones
that were screened in two environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: one in a cool environment and one in our
tropical station of San Ramon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that some of the materials,
when they're grown in warm environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: are indeed too high in glycoalkaloid,
too high in glycoalkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been put in our catalog and to
be offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this trait imparts a bitter flavor to
the potato and actually can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we need to pay
attention to earlier on in the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the case that we're breeding
for heat tolerant, for warm environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the case that we're using a wide
germplasm base in which we may be
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing wild species, which are going
to bring this trait into our pedigrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to make progress in Asia,
we worked with a network of five
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had support from the government of
Luxembourg for research on heat tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutritional quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also used that resource to start a
breeding network in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this network was coordinated through
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a breeder in Vietnam who
coordinated the network with five other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, Indonesia, Philippines,
Laos, Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the targets was the existing
rice-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've seen before, the production of
potato in Vietnam is very low right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only 20,000 hectares, but it's
expected to have the potential for use on
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Philippines, in Indonesia, the crop is
also used as a vegetable, but it's also an
[SPEAKER_00]: important income crop, as I mentioned,
for Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in inserting potatoes
into the rice-based systems in Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in accessing new areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in Laos, there's a plateau
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over 800,000 hectares of volcanic
soils, and a highland plateau,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very suitable for potato,
and now is used only for pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that this is a tremendous
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we worked with this
network is through our collaborator in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made both transfer of clonal material
from our breeding program, and we started
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeding program in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: To accelerate the progress for adaptation
to these warmer, short-season
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's the countries that we
worked with, some of the materials we
[SPEAKER_00]: sent, and one of the crossing blocks
established in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the breeder there did is he
intercrossed within our two populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't yet combined the populations,
so he made intercrosses in the lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics virus-resistant population,
and in the tropical highland
[SPEAKER_00]: late-flight-resistant population,
to make rapid gains for the target
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did move material from Peru to two of
the stronger national programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are in Indonesia and Philippines,
which are perfectly capable of receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: in-vitro plants and growing them out,
but Myanmar and Laos don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a training program in each of
the countries, and our breeder from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam traveled to help establish the
trials in Myanmar and in Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the materials that he generated in
Vietnam were passed directly to these
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries without having to come
back to Peru for redistribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can call this a kind of a shift,
because our potato breeding program is
[SPEAKER_00]: rather centralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we do most of our breeding
in Peru, but we were able to make genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: gains for our target environment by this
breeding program in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the left, I'm just showing the
samples of the populations that we
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We contributed several clones from the
highland tropics population, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowland subtropics population,
and also from a new subgroup, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: late-flight heat tolerant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sent those to Vietnam for use in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have already two varieties in the
release process in breeding from this set,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also have increased the performance
in terms of yield per day by this local
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we're in the process of doing,
actually seven of these clones have been
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to China for further evaluation,
and two are in the release process from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is only a demonstration,
of course, of why we should decentralize
[SPEAKER_00]: our breeding program and why we are now
recruiting a breeder for Asia to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: this success.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of this breeding target,
the agile potato for Asia, we have now 60
[SPEAKER_00]: elite potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some people like red skin or
yellow flesh and have a preference,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not yet breeding for idiot
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually distribute a basket of options
from our current cycle of recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can select from the catalog by
skin color, but the material we offer has
[SPEAKER_00]: a range of skin color and flesh color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually meets the standard dry matter
considerations, and it should be low from
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoalkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a secondary trait, we're also
screening for potato chip quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention two unexpected
traits for a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have demand now for two traits that we
wouldn't expect to need in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is coming the demand both from south
of China and from Ethiopia to combine
[SPEAKER_00]: late-flight resistance with drought
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really because of the
unpredictable rainfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a farmer selecting the potato variety
to grow doesn't know whether it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: rainy or it will be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're screening our late-flight
resistant heat-tolerant population for
[SPEAKER_00]: drought in the south of Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have access to desert conditions in the
south of Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a number of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're intensively screening them for
glycoalkaloids because not only heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also drought is a cause of this stress
that increases the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have just a field day to try
to offer some of the new elite clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: involve the farming community in the
selection of late-flight resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: material, which for this desert
environment is not an important trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our breeding program, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, these materials can be produced
on the coast of Peru with limited
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move to my third topic,
which is a little bit about impact
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, which we're required to present
to our center, to our donors, and to our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past 12 or so years,
we have distributed a large amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm to our target countries or to
research partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an example of,
I think it's nearly 2,000 true seed
[SPEAKER_00]: families for programs which are strong
enough to select from true seed and make
[SPEAKER_00]: their own clonal selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send crosses from parents which have
good combining ability for the target
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some knowledge of target
environments through our shuttle breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program and some homology with our
Peruvian conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also move in vitro material,
and particularly that's used for programs
[SPEAKER_00]: which don't have a capacity to select from
the true seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about, I think it's about 1,800
families, and you can see the countries to
[SPEAKER_00]: which they've been distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bar is just showing the bulk of the
size of the material, and then about 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that were distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our assessment of
productivity is how much we distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our weaknesses is that we're not
very good at following up what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: after we make these large distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, where we do have projects and
direct collaborations with the national
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, I mentioned in the case of
Bangladesh, we have four releases during
[SPEAKER_00]: one recent project sponsored by the German
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two are late flight resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is heat tolerant, and one is salt
tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we work with our national
programs, this is the TuberCrop Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Center in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to enter, or they enter,
our elite clones into their
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-environment variety trials,
and of course we have to see the superior
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, not only for the breeding
trait, but also for yield against the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, which in this case are diamond and
asterisk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, I mentioned, work with our social
science department, and we have a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: impact specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have recently conducted a survey for
many crop country combinations across the
[SPEAKER_00]: CGIR, including potato and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a result that they have found
in China, looking at the impact of SIPP's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the impact of SIPP's
breeding program, we can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency of variety release, but it's
more important to look at a diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a piece of an adoption study
from China, and what we measure here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we ask the social scientists to pay
attention to a variety that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: SIPP's breeding program in two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it means that it's from SIPP crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means, in general, that it's either a
true seed progeny or a clone, selected by
[SPEAKER_00]: SIPP, in which both parents are from SIPP,
or in the cases where the breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: has used one SIPP parent in a breeding
program to give a 50% attribution to SIPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So China has over five million hectares of
potato, and we could find that 1.2 million
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares are dedicated to already adoption
of SIPP-bred potato varieties from either
[SPEAKER_00]: of these two routes, either from the
introduction of advanced clones from SIPP,
[SPEAKER_00]: or from crossing that they have made with
SIPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a third way of attribution,
which is that SIPP sometimes facilitates
[SPEAKER_00]: the transfer of material from one strong
program to another, but these are not
[SPEAKER_00]: included in this assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, in Peru, well, I guess it's
logical that we have a corner on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in Peru with a strong breeding
program, but Peru also breeds potatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you can see from this picture,
half of the potatoes in Peru are native
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only about 50% of the potatoes that are
grown in Peru are improved varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of that, half of them are attributed
to, of the adopted varieties, attributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to SIPP's breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to call attention to the dates
because one of my points that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make before closing is for the need to
accelerate our breeding program,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to achieve genetic gains for
multiple traits, but also to deliver those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic gains to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these varieties are predominantly grown
in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all bred by SIPP, and they were
released from the 1990s up until 2005,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's only now that we're starting to
see their footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study that measured over all of
the regions of the Peruvian highlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our target for poverty
alleviation, but even 15 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, just under 15 years later,
this variety is only starting to show its
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the adoption of potato is slow when you
have a successful variety, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at this kind of study,
we see that most of the varieties being
[SPEAKER_00]: released, and certainly those being
adopted, are from crosses made in 1993 or
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly with climate change and
with new production areas coming under
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, we really need to look for
ways to accelerate the gains in our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program and also to improve the
communication for the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials and to be able to track and
accelerate the delivery of our improved
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be either done by local breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be done by improving the
analysis of data so that we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: full advantage our global trials,
make decisions in the breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: either in Peru or in one of the
environments, and we also think that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an opportunity for new science
from genomics to contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerating the gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do make catalogs every two years,
and these are segregated by, as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, skin color or flesh color and
traits, so that if somebody wants to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: our webpage and select materials,
they have access and they can order
[SPEAKER_00]: through our germplasm unit, which keeps
the elite materials in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that many of you are aware,
and particularly those of you who are
[SPEAKER_00]: working on potato, that it's no longer an
orphan crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of genomic resources
now available for potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our program, we contributed to the
genome sequencing and particularly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: alignment of the genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the not so recent advances for
potato genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main contribution was to develop the
diploid mapping population, DM,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was contributed to seven different
labs who were engaged in mapping the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequence to the potato chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, through the soil cap initiative,
which Cornell participated in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also through the GBS development,
we have access to a very large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic markers, which we're starting to
apply for understanding genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: and improving traits in potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and regardless of how fast
genomic advances go, we are still burdened
[SPEAKER_00]: by phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trait that I mentioned to you earlier
on, shortening the vegetative period of
[SPEAKER_00]: the potato and improving its adaptation to
heat, is a series of complex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is a compensation in
potato between heat and long photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods, so we use these range of field
conditions to increase the earliness of
[SPEAKER_00]: our populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're applying a phenotypic method that
was actually developed here at Cornell by
[SPEAKER_00]: Elmer Ewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the cutting method.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the potato field at 40 days,
we can take a nodal cutting and root it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a mist chamber and see whether the plant
has been initiated to tuberize or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the early-tuberization
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have access.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lights in our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Peru, I told you that we're in
short-day conditions, but we can extend
[SPEAKER_00]: our field conditions to 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted some genetic analysis in our
population using four environments in our
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamolin experiment station because we have
a cool season and a warm season,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have short days and long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be validated, of course,
when we have fewer materials in our target
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have scoring methods in our phenotyping
procedure, both for the degree and
[SPEAKER_00]: earliness of tuber initiation,
for the length and size of the stolons,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an indication also of tuberose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have early-tuberization in the
form of the tuber and also for what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call bulking-based maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about earliness, we're not
really interested only in senescence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliage, but we're interested in
early-tuberization, early bulking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have worked with SolCap chips and also
with GBS assays from Cornell to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct genome-wide association studies
for components of this early heat
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some examples of earliness,
stolon formation, and bulking-based
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity from our GWAS analysis,
and we can see some similarity with genes
[SPEAKER_00]: which have already been published by
others, particularly on chromosome 5 for
[SPEAKER_00]: earliness, but other important regions of
the genome that seem to be influencing the
[SPEAKER_00]: differential performance of these
materials under short and long-day
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and under warm and cool
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conducted a pilot study of genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only using 170 individuals from a
panel, and in this we've worked with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same traits and actually the same data
from our GWAS studies, and we've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to test a couple of different models for
genomic selection by entering markers into
[SPEAKER_00]: the model, and I think that it's generally
understood that if the predictive value is
[SPEAKER_00]: over.3 or .4, that your method has a
chance for offering to accelerate the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're only working with a test
puppy population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our training population was about
140 genotypes, and the test population was
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted for that, and in this graph
we're comparing the estimated breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: value with the actual observed value,
and we have a fairly good positive
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have started to work with other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work I mentioned so far is in Peru,
except that we're validating the
[SPEAKER_00]: population estimates in Vietnam in a
mid-long-day environment, and we've just
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten the first phenotypic data that we
have to subject to genotyping for
[SPEAKER_00]: validating that model I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a German-funded project also to
work on genome-wide association studies in
[SPEAKER_00]: an international testing panel,
and in this project we've developed a
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity panel from all of our breeding
programs, not yet with the bio-fortified
[SPEAKER_00]: materials, but all of the subpopulations
from the highland and lowland groups into
[SPEAKER_00]: a panel of 360 clones, which have been
genotyped both by Solcap and by GBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have field evaluations in our three
target countries, which are Peru,
[SPEAKER_00]: China, and Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In China we have three sites from the
north to the south, so we have a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: transect for day-length adaptation,
and in Ethiopia we have a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to the two contradictory traits I
mentioned to you, late-light and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are four phenotyping protocols
which we've distributed to six national
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, and those are for bulking-based
maturity, virus resistance, late-light
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, and drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make this genomic
information available as a training tool
[SPEAKER_00]: for the national programs who are
interested in selecting varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: using superior clones in breeding,
but we hope that this can also get us on
[SPEAKER_00]: the start for a genome-associated breeding
program for distant environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our collaborators is at Max
Planck Institute, and we were able to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: a workshop so that data analysis and
protocols could be exchanged with the
[SPEAKER_00]: national programs at the beginning of the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think this is probably my last
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has also led to the opportunity to
compare the performance and validate
[SPEAKER_00]: expected genomic regions responsible for
late-light resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have already done some preliminary
mapping from diploid and tetraploid
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of SIPS breeding population,
and we know something about the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture of late-light resistance in
our advanced populations, and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: very interested in this international
late-light trial for GWAS, and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already seen so far, for example,
some of the same genomic regions are
[SPEAKER_00]: effective against the populations in China
as in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my last slide, Walter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some cooking tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron and zinc are not possible,
and I think the availability is the same.
We've done some testing for potatoes,
and I don't have to go into more details,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a rather stable trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: The instability is actually very high,
so that we have a large T by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if some of my graphs show
that even with a raw potato, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: large effect of the soil, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The availability of zinc is particularly
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, it's the interaction,
the G by T interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a crossover type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ranking type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the highest is always the highest,
so that gives us some confidence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more needs to be done really on
managing fields for a breeding trial to
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenize the availability of zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done some GWAS on zinc,
and we do get better results when zinc is
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of wondering, you mentioned
the tetraploids are providing a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases, but how good is the yield now in
the diploids versus the tetraploid?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, controversial question for
potato breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned, many commercial
varieties in Peru are diploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really quite fair to talk
about the average yield of potato in Peru
[SPEAKER_01]: or in Africa as a competitive commercial
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our breeding program, usually
around 25, 27 hectares, tons per hectare,
[SPEAKER_00]: is typical for diploid potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can approximately yield of 30 or so
tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are diploid land races,
which actually probably are a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: example of a diploid potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another popular breeding strategy
now for inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know yet what the yield will
be when we inbreed and if we want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: contentional hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walter gave a fact that his father
calculated 70%, I think, that he said that
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry De Jong has done some research and
found that diploid potato yields should be
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to be 70% of the tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70%?
[SPEAKER_05]: In his career, the best human diploids
were 70% of the best human tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether the Solynta experiment breaks that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have an amazing problem here.
Do you think correlation will have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are positively correlated in the
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some common QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a zinc ion binding protein
candidate gene that seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been selecting, since iron is
a little bit of a cleaner trade,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been selecting on iron and getting
games in zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the nutritionists are now
advising us that if we release a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: high in both, they may compete in the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, our product, we're going to
categorize it, iron, zinc, and both,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then with and without disease
resistance so that when we make our first
[SPEAKER_01]: international trials, that we'll be able
to really assess the impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fact that I became aware of quite
late because the Hybris Plus program
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't mentioned it to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the diet, I think that they can
have a negative impact if you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same food source, both iron and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for breeding, it's favorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if there are any,
did you observe any correlation between
[SPEAKER_03]: the iron or the zinc?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning when we started our
screening, we looked for any negative
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't found any at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little bit of an unfortunate
negative correlation with tumor size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in the, we're now in our fourth
cycle of recurrent selection at the
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid level, and the tumors are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that maybe we have been
able to appreciate when we brought to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploids, we have, it seems like we
recovered some pyrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started the diploid breeding program
with a limited gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after four cycles of recurrent
selection, we lost a little bit of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mostly due to tumor size,
but not with disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question, Susan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The portion of the potato yield,
like the potato that's harvested in Asia
[SPEAKER_01]: is eaten as, let's say, boiled or mashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what proportion is eaten as processed
chips?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just concerned about the negative
influence on the diet of the potato once
[SPEAKER_01]: converted into something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you could take the case of
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potato is used in what they call
curries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of a stew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's used and cooked with
vegetables in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very healthy use of potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is a huge demand for a
processing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were offered a project by a processing
company in Bangladesh, which wants to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of the favorable ecology and for
export to Singapore and Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for the future, it's definitely
a concern when we look for the demand of
[SPEAKER_00]: potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our social science department,
we have the intention to try to promote,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they do for sweet potato, to try to
promote healthy uses as it's incorporated
[SPEAKER_01]: into the diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather make potato chips than rice any
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
