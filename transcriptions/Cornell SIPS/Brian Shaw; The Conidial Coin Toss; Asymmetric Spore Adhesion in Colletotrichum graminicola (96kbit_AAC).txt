[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Chris said, I am a former graduate
student from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking back on my career,
those were some of my favorite times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The times when I lived in Ithaca and then
up in Geneva with Harvey Hoek as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got married in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I got married on the lakefront
up in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked back on those times as being
some of our best friends and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best times of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say especially to the
students of you who are there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are so fortunate to be attending
school at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a fantastic place.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so if you know my career at all,
you probably think of me as an aspergillus
[SPEAKER_02]: nidulin geneticist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of my career, I have focused on
that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at hyphal growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm actually going to tell a different
story today because I've recently become
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in particularly colototrichum
graminiculum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am a microscopist and a cell
biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And colototrichum really has amazing cell
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably even better than neurospora.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the field, I think
colototrichum, there's a lot that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: done with colototrichum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm going to tell you about a
story with knidia, the knidial coin toss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see in this image two different
knidia depicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trusting that my mouse that I'm
moving around here is visible to you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, then please somebody yell at
me so I can figure out how to fix it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are two knidia here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is stationary and therefore I
would call it attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is not stationary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that because subsequent
pictures that are depicted in this are
[SPEAKER_02]: showing a blurring, particularly at the
tips of the spora.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is where this concept of the
coin toss comes from, is that there is
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly a 50-50 selection mechanism for
the attachment of these spores to their
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to tell you how we got to
that conclusion in today's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so as most of you are probably aware,
colototrichum graminicula is an ascomyces
[SPEAKER_02]: that causes diseases, various diseases of
corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the top 10 most economically
relevant fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes foliar lesions on corn plants,
but also is associated with stalk rot,
[SPEAKER_02]: which causes the lodging of the stalks and
makes it impossible to harvest the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very economically damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the greatest sources of yield
loss among maize pathogens, resulting in
[SPEAKER_02]: tens of millions of bushels to be lost
each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called this image out of a review
article by our very own Dr. Bergstrom.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so my interest is in the early events
of the production of spores and in spore
[SPEAKER_02]: germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's take a brief overview of what
happens here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So colototrichum produces two types of
canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a microcanidia that are often
called oval canidia in the field that are
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to be part of this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not part of this mechanism
that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oval canidia are thought to be involved in
the dispersal of the organism within the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the dispersal outside of the plant and
to the plant is mediated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: macrocanidia, which are also called
balkate canidia due to their shape here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the spores that we see in
this image.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're these crescent shaped spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the spores germinate, typically
you'll see one germ tube emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That very quickly, under appropriate
conditions, very quickly that germ tube
[SPEAKER_02]: will stop fuller eyes grow and begin to
differentiate the infection structure of
[SPEAKER_02]: the aphrosaurium, which we see in this
image.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it will penetrate its host using
a melanized aphrosauria using a mechanism
[SPEAKER_02]: that is very similar to the better
characterized system of magnaportho or
[SPEAKER_02]: pericularia arising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it uses melanin derived turgor pressure
in order to penetrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can get septation in the
spore in order to get multiple aphrosauria
[SPEAKER_02]: forming from the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once it penetrates the host,
you'll get ramification of hyphae
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the maize tissue, as we see in
this image, where the maize tissue is
[SPEAKER_02]: stained red and a GFP expressing strand of
colicotrichum shows us where the hyphae
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing through the infected host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, several years back, I was along with
a grad student, a farmer grad student of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine, Chih-Li Wang, we created a life act
strain of colicotrichum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So life act is a reporter that shows us in
live cells, the actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these next few images we're going to
see are showing us of what the behavior is
[SPEAKER_02]: of the actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during these early events of
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see up here a dormant spore pre
germination spore that already has this
[SPEAKER_02]: well-defined actin cytoskeleton network
running from tip to tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the spore germinates, and here I'll be
showing a time-lapse and this is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: setting the stage for the types of data
that I'll be showing you throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a time-lapse video where a picture
is taken approximately once a minute and
[SPEAKER_02]: then is being played back at a much faster
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing hours and minutes
represented in the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this video, we see the germination
of a felfate spore where the actin
[SPEAKER_02]: cytoskeleton is highly polarized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll wait for it to loop back around
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can begin from the beginning of the
sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a highly polarized actin
cytoskeleton in the tip of the germin
[SPEAKER_02]: tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actin retracts to a septum as the
septum is differentiated within the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the septum is delineated,
the actin then migrates back out to
[SPEAKER_02]: polarize in the growing germ tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here now we're going to look at apresorium
formation in a similar time-lapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: These time-lapses are approximately three
hours long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the septum has already formed in this
time-lapse and we now see polarization of
[SPEAKER_02]: the actin cytoskeleton that then
depolarizes as the germ tube begins to
[SPEAKER_02]: swell to form an apresorium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the actin all then relocalizes to the
septation site as a septum delineates the
[SPEAKER_02]: apresorium from the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final time-lapse in this
sequence will be looking at an apresorium
[SPEAKER_02]: from the point of septum formation to the
point of penetration peg formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the actin was localized to the nascent
septum, the septum forms, actin
[SPEAKER_02]: redistributes into the apresorium,
and now it begins to localize to the
[SPEAKER_02]: penetration as a penetration peg begins to
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point of all this is to show you
that all of these developmental events
[SPEAKER_02]: require the actin cytoskeleton and likely
the trafficking of cellular components on
[SPEAKER_02]: the actin cytoskeleton to these sites of
growth as the cell grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my department just got a new building.
[SPEAKER_02]: About two years ago, we moved into a new
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along with that new building,
some of us were fortunate enough to get
[SPEAKER_02]: new equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no exception to that, I got a shiny
new confocal microscope that has all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is a piece of technology
available on a confocal microscope,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's on this microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has really been a boon for my
career since moving into this new building
[SPEAKER_02]: because the types of questions that I can
ask have greatly expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example of that here is we see a
growing hyphae of Calatachicum graminicula
[SPEAKER_02]: in which we're imaging sites of
endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each one of these foci are actually the
sites of endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, I won't be talking
about endocytosis in this talk,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that has been one of the focal points
of my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have this nice new microscope that
allows us to ask questions with even
[SPEAKER_02]: greater detail than we have done so
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moments ago, when I was talking about
these early events of germination,
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you a dormant or pre-germination
score of Calatachicum graminicula.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the macrocannadium or
falcatecannadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has this pre-formed actin
cytoskeleton that runs from tip to tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we noticed that when we did the study
five or six years ago, but we were not
[SPEAKER_02]: able to go into any greater detail of what
this pre-formed cytoskeleton might be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the new microscope has allowed us to
take another look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this movie here that I'm going
to show you, this is a Z-stack or a
[SPEAKER_02]: three-dimensional projection of a spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're rotating so that you can see
that the actin cytoskeleton is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: asymmetric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is on one face of the spore,
not on the other face of the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a visual aid for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My visual aid is somewhat comical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this Frenchy banana, but it's
essentially a falcatecannadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trust that you all can see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody please shout at me if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this banana, which is representing
the falcatecannadium, I've drawn with a
[SPEAKER_02]: sharpie the actin cytoskeleton that's on
one face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the image, we're seeing the spore
rotating like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're seeing the actin cytoskeleton
is on just one face of the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the first, when we imaged it
this way, is when we realized that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: there is something to this asymmetry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started to look at what could be the
possible function or mechanism for this
[SPEAKER_02]: asymmetry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we decided to look at spores as they
were formed on the Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So collototrichum, when grown in on agar,
will make these sort of erupting pustules
[SPEAKER_02]: out of their acerbuli that has this gooey
matrix in which the canidia are secreted
[SPEAKER_02]: into from the acerbulis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're looking at here are
mature spores within that gooey matrix,
[SPEAKER_02]: just inverted onto the microscope so that
we can see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you will agree with me that the
predominance of all of these spores have
[SPEAKER_02]: that actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few instances in here,
like maybe up here where maybe you would
[SPEAKER_02]: say the cytoskeleton is not there,
but I think that's probably a trick of the
[SPEAKER_02]: focal point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the actin cytoskeleton is pre-formed on
pre-germination spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we looked at a young developing
acerbulis as it was producing the canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the center of this image,
we have canidia that are being produced
[SPEAKER_02]: and are still attached to the
canadiogenous cells, giving rise to those
[SPEAKER_02]: spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're revealed with a cell wall
stand that shows a blue cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of these nascent canidia that
are still in the process of being formed
[SPEAKER_02]: do not have that cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of the mature canidia that have
been released from these canadiogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cells do have that actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So production of the actin cytoskeleton
occurs early in the development of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spore just after it is liberated from the
canadiogenous cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to verify that claim that I just made,
in this sequence, we're going to look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time lapse of a canidium as it is being
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the image, we see the canadiogenous
cell here and a young nascent canidium as
[SPEAKER_02]: it's being produced from that
canadiogenous cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this image actually has three panes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot see the GFP channel at this
stage because the GFP is not being
[SPEAKER_02]: produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have GFP, we have transmitted light,
and then the overlay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll play this image.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is at 15-minute intervals for
several hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see development of the
canidium from that canadiogenous cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it reaches its terminal length,
it begins to introduce that curvature
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristic of the falcate canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still do not see the actin
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right about now, as the canidium is
separated from the canadiogenous cell,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll start to see that actin
cytoskeleton form up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can then see the next canidium
being produced from the canadiogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cell, concomitant with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll play that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of an amazing feat of grad
student ingenuity to get this image.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the newest grad student in my lab,
Ollie Bedsell, who was able to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: sequence of a developing canidium of
colicotrichum graminicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still no actin cytoskeleton until the
spore is released from its canadiogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cell, and immediately deposition of that
point-to-point actin array begins to
[SPEAKER_02]: occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this image, we are using an inverted
microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine that my finger is the lens,
and we're looking at spores settling down
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're watching spores settle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as this loops through, you will see
that some spores attach to the coverslip
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one and this one both attach the
instant they make contact with the
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some spores remain unattached.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see these continuously vibrating,
moving around in a Brownian-like motion
[SPEAKER_02]: because they are unattached.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is roughly a half-and-half
situation with spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you can also see that those
spores that are attached have actin within
[SPEAKER_02]: the focal plane nearest to the substrate
that we're imaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those that are not attached lack that
actin cytoskeletal element in the focal
[SPEAKER_02]: plane that we're imaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when not agitated, we resolve in
roughly half of the spores attaching to a
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, that is depicted numerically in
graph form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of a complex graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray line, I'm sorry, the black bar
graph is showing us the percent of spores
[SPEAKER_02]: that are attached over time, so 0 hours
through 15 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that attachment hovers in
the neighborhood of 40% to 50% attachment
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter the time and this is important
that the spores remain undisturbed in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to see this 50% attachment rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as the spores are disturbed,
the percent attached will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the line, we see the percent
germinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the next concept that these
spores must be attached in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the spore is attached, then we
achieve germination of the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at zero time, we've got zero
germination, but it's up in the 40 to 50
[SPEAKER_02]: to 60% range over several hours after the
spores become attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the dotted line here,
we see that germination does not occur at
[SPEAKER_02]: all on any spores that are unattached.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've left this over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 48 hours or longer on spores that are
unattached remain unattached if they were
[SPEAKER_02]: undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They remain unattached and they remain
underminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so more pictorial evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we're looking at the same two spores
in two different focal planes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first is the focal plane nearest
the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see that actin cytoskeletal
array running from point to point nearest
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface in the attached spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no observable actin
cytoskeletal array in the unattached
[SPEAKER_02]: spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go to the top focal plane of that
spore, the same two spores, we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: actin cytoskeletal array still exists in
the unattached spore, but it is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong face of the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'll use my banana scrunchie as
my pictorial demonstration just to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure we're all on the same page,
the sharpie representing the actin
[SPEAKER_02]: cytoskeletal element.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the spore is on the surface on that
face, it's attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the cytoskeletal element is up,
the spore remains unattached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and so here's some evidence for that
in numeric form.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a spore is attached, then it likely has
the actin cytoskeleton on the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: nearest to the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the spore is unattached, then that
organized actin is at the top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is fully reproducible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do occasionally see attachment when
the actin is at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll explain that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a small amount of attachment
using another mechanism that I'll explain
[SPEAKER_02]: when we get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this led us to make the proposal
of the canadial coin toss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here is a graphical representation
of one of these spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use my banana, rather than looking at
it like this, we're looking at it like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the spore settles through water,
these are splash dispersed spores,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to settle with the fat face of
that spore down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it hits the surface, it rotates
this way or rotates this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on the orientation of the
actin cytoskeleton, we'll determine if it
[SPEAKER_02]: attaches immediately to the surface or if
it never attaches to the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so digging through the literature,
we found a review paper by Dr. Bergstrom
[SPEAKER_02]: and Nicholson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that review paper, they address
some older literature where the
[SPEAKER_02]: extracellular matrix of colicotrychum was
addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these spores are secreted,
they're liberated into a matrix from the
[SPEAKER_02]: canadiogenes cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're dealing with this matrix,
which is this extracellular matrix,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also when the spores begin to
germinate, they kind of secrete an
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesive matrix around the germline as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's what's being dealt
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so it was previously characterized
that the extracellular matrix is composed
[SPEAKER_02]: of glycoproteins, glucans, and amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we scratched our heads a little bit
about how we might be able to utilize this
[SPEAKER_02]: information on the microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that led us to concanavolin A,
which is a lectin that binds to glucans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a protein that binds to
glucans that can be conjugated to a
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorophore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, we used TRITC tritzy,
which is a red fluorophore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so con A binds to glucans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this image, we have, I'm using
three colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I'm using a cell wall
stain called cellophenol that stains the
[SPEAKER_02]: cell wall blue, so we can see the canidia
a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually a confocal based
fungal cell wall stain that Harvey Holt
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was the original originator of the
use of the cell wall that's gaining
[SPEAKER_02]: widespread use in the fungal community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have con A, which is binding to
glucans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you'll see that there is a
strip of glucans on the canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we then, with the other channel,
image life act, so the actin GFP,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see again our tip to tip actin
cytoskeletal array within the canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do the overlay over in this
image.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you will agree with me that
there is a one-to-one correlation between
[SPEAKER_02]: the presence of the actin cytoskeletal
array and this glucan binding con A
[SPEAKER_02]: reactive moiety, which we assume is an
adhesive.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this stage, we assume it's an adhesive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this image, I think it's just
absolutely dynamite because it shows
[SPEAKER_02]: spores and all three possible
configurations with actin up, actin down,
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesive up, adhesive down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the rare occasions when the
geometry of the cell allows the spore to
[SPEAKER_02]: settle with the adhesive not in contact
with the surface, but also not facing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the point of this is that we
have a glucan moiety associated with the
[SPEAKER_02]: actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here again, as one of these
three-dimensional images through the spore
[SPEAKER_02]: and then through the magic of computer
assistance, we're rotating that
[SPEAKER_02]: three-dimensional projection of the spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I hope you will see that the
glucan moiety is directly correlated to
[SPEAKER_02]: the presence of that actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our presumption would be that it's
being secreted by components running on
[SPEAKER_02]: that actin cytoskeleton, but we have not
actually proven that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to make sure, because sometimes
seeing the video is not immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: obvious to everyone, I've got my banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're looking at is the spore
doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the strip on the banana represents
both the actin cytoskeleton and that
[SPEAKER_02]: glucan con-A reactive moiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I showed you the percentages in a
graph earlier, I said that sometimes we
[SPEAKER_02]: hit numbers that aren't quite 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the reasoning for that is
actually revealed in this image because
[SPEAKER_02]: the glucan moiety is also present at the
tips of the spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes spores aren't shaped quite
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be bent like this or this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And however they settle, they're always
going to hit a tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is a non-coin toss element to
selection for adhesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's another time lapse where
we're watching the spore settle down
[SPEAKER_02]: towards us on an inverted microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let this play through again and
hopefully pause it in just the right
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so if I could get it paused in the
right place, which I don't think I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the con-A reactive glucan
strip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's facing the same direction on those
two spores, A and B.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as the movie plays, you can see the
spores settle in opposite directions of
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: B is settling with con-A down and the
spore attaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And A is settling with the con-A reactive
strip up and it does not attach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the settling of the spore,
which determines whether it will attach or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, since this is a glucan, our
presumption, because con-A binds to
[SPEAKER_02]: glucans, our presumption is that this is a
glucan moiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to treat spores with an enzyme
to determine whether that strip is the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual adhesive element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on the left, we see what's familiar
to you now, this rotation of a spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's our control where you can see the
actin cytoskeleton as well as the con-A
[SPEAKER_02]: reactive glucan reactive strip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the right, we have used enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually still have a stash of Novozyme
in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our glucanase is Novozyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that that con-A reactive
strip has been removed from the spore with
[SPEAKER_02]: Novozyme treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some debris in the field and
that's actually very lucky for this image
[SPEAKER_02]: because it shows us that con-A is actually
present in this preparation because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see the debris in the background
reacting with con-A, but the strip is
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is further confirmation that the
strip is composed of at least in part of
[SPEAKER_02]: glucan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the image that you see to the
right is of the glucanase treated spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope what you will see is that
almost all of the spores in this image are
[SPEAKER_02]: con-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are rare occasions in here where
a spore looks to be immobile, like below
[SPEAKER_02]: this strip that's playing here is an
immobile spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, these are all
moving with the flow of liquid inside of
[SPEAKER_02]: the chamber that we're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no con-A reactive strip composed of
glucanase and there's no attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's quantified over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Control is roughly 50% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enzyme treated, we get close to zero
attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next we wanted to know since the
previous study I mentioned before from
[SPEAKER_02]: Bergstrom and Nicholson had showed that
there is a secreted adhesive from Kala
[SPEAKER_02]: Kotchkom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to know the timing of the
importance of this con-A reactive strip to
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way to get at that would be to fix
the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data that I'm showing here are
formaldehyde fixed cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the canidia were treated with
formaldehyde to kill them and then
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment assays would perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's indistinguishable of the percent
attachment that's achieved when
[SPEAKER_02]: formaldehyde is used to kill cells versus
living cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that to me indicates that the liberated
spores that we harvested are already
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment competent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not... Sorry, I got a battery
low warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna make sure I get this thing plugged
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why that would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my charger is not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully this is gonna... Hopefully
I can finish up before my battery dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next we wanted to see can we flip
spores and cause them to attach?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're using here is a
micro-controller that is controlling a
[SPEAKER_02]: motor that we got out of an old cell
phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're all familiar with turning your
ringer off on your cell phone and somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: calls you and your cell phone vibrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little motor in the phone
that does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we have attached to a slide here
and it's controlled by a micro-controller
[SPEAKER_02]: that controls the length of vibration,
the time of vibration, as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: intensity of the vibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this image, what we're going to see
is you can see the vibration happen in the
[SPEAKER_02]: video as it occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look across this field,
you can see, for example, here is an
[SPEAKER_02]: un-attached spore that flips over and
becomes attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is an un-attached spore that doesn't
flip over and it remains un-attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is an attached spore that remains
attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the punchline of this movie is seeing
that spores can flip over and immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: attach upon that flipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm entirely distracted by my
charger not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we address this in another way by
pipetting a solution of a motor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we attach the un-attached spores onto a
substrate, allowing them to settle,
[SPEAKER_02]: quantifying, because we're working with an
inverted microscope, quantifying
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after various time periods,
using the pipetter to agitate the liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no disturbance with a pipetter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got roughly 50% attachment as shown
with this very line here across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we allow them to settle and then
disturb after five minutes, we achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: much higher percentage attachment,
80 to 90% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we allow them to settle for 10 minutes,
it remains at roughly 50% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 10 minutes of disturbance,
you get nearly 100% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here is allow them to settle and
quantify for 15 minutes and we remain at
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes to a high level of
attachment after the disturbance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can flip these spores, whether we
use a cell phone or a pipetter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they will attach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what does all this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that the mechanism that we're
seeing here is to enhance the dispersal of
[SPEAKER_02]: the fundus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if all spores attach upon initial
settling of the spores, then the size of
[SPEAKER_02]: the infection core would only be as big as
the raindrop where it settles the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think, again, this is about dispersal
of the spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if spores were to settle and all attach
in that raindroplet, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be dealing with only very small lesions at
any one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that only some spores will
attach initially, then if the spore,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the droplet of water containing spores
runs down the leaf or falls off the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: to another leaf or another plant,
or maybe a subsequent raindrop splashes
[SPEAKER_02]: this, or maybe the raindrop dries out and
we have some unattached dried out spores
[SPEAKER_02]: that will then rehydrate and be dispersed
again with a subsequent dew or rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these things can then result in
further dispersal of the spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all about then dispersal and
selection for greater dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still working on ways that we could
quantify this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing that we've tried is to look
at cover slips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bench top scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a microscope scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think of ways of doing this
artificially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at these long cover slips at
various angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we've got a flat cover slip,
then we get about 50% attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's angled slightly so the drop never
rolls and all the spores are more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: distributed in the initial droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we've got a greater angle on the
cover slip, allow the spores to adhere or
[SPEAKER_02]: to settle, then we get some spores in that
initial droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, this is kind of
expected, I guess, but as that droplet
[SPEAKER_02]: moves down the cover slip, you get
deposition of spores down the cover slip
[SPEAKER_02]: as it runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm still working on ways to model
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have done some, we've tried to do
this on corn leaves as well, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: microscopy gets exponentially more
difficult to achieve if we try to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: on corn leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, in conclusion, then we've got our
conitial coin toss model that we see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is now enhanced by also having the
presence of that adhesive strip,
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably composed of glucans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've got this polarized actin
array that pre-formed and pre-germinated
[SPEAKER_02]: canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that the production of that
actin array occurs when the spores are
[SPEAKER_02]: liberated from the canadiogenes cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actin array tracks a discrete area of
adhesive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet if that actin array
would be the distribution network that
[SPEAKER_02]: allows the secretion of that adhesive
material, or is it actually more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sensing mechanism?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I also told you that these spores
don't germinate unless they're attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the spores must sense in some way that
they have become immobilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actin array may also be
participating in that sensing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial attachment is passive,
that adhesive is pre-formed, and
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment occurs instantly upon contact
with the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attachment is cited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this likely enhances spore dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So outstanding questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the relationship between the
actin and the adhesive?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just sort of mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the actin the distribution network?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably yes, but also probably the actin
is as part of the sensory network
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with the spore realizing that
it's become immobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the relationship between this and
the previously characterized secreted
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesive?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a collaboration with some
physicists that do Raman spectroscopy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're actually in the process of using
Raman spectroscopy to try to determine
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in the adhesive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does that adhesive at the spore
tips affect the coin toss?
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't actually perfectly 50-50
attachment, and that's because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesive that we see at the tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to make modeling of this
much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got an epidemiologist who's
helping me with the conceptualization of
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect of wettability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been using this mostly on cover
slips.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet really the effect of
this on a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the corn plants, the leaves are going
to be waxy because of the cuticular wax,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're going to be more hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know yet the effect of that
on this dispersal method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to play this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really a mystery to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the acon array here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is using the dye FM4 that shows
us a membrane within the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that what you see in this
pre-germinated cell is the dynamic
[SPEAKER_02]: collapse of that acon cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually being achieved by this
membrane-bound organelle that is
[SPEAKER_02]: trafficking on the acon cytoskeleton,
almost like Pac-Man gobbling it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've shown this to some of my
colleagues at work on the acon
[SPEAKER_02]: cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have yet to come up with a convincing
hypothesis for what that structure might
[SPEAKER_02]: be that's actually causing the collapse of
the acon cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do see this often enough in the
cells to know that the dynamic collapse of
[SPEAKER_02]: the acon is actually happening in
pre-germinated cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know the mechanism for that
at this time either.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally then, I just want to mention
again that my history has come full
[SPEAKER_02]: circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was a grad student with Harvey Hoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to work on spora attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a 1999 paper with me and Harvey
in which we were characterizing an
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesive sheath on the spores of the black
rot of grape fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will also point out that this
inquiry took us then to try to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium signaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: During that spore attachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we largely failed at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pointing this out because I
actually co-authored a paper with Gillian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Gillian, you don't even remember
the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the way back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my dear friend and departed colleague,
Nick Reed, was also an author on this
[SPEAKER_02]: paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, then I will show you that
these are the people that actually did the
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Vaselli is a senior grad student in my
lab who will be graduating soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has fantastic microscopy skills and
will be looking for a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone up there needs a microscopy
oriented postdoc, he would be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: person to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan and Hope are two undergraduates who
work on the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Ali up here is a brand new grad
student who's going to be taking over from
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe on the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with that then, I can end and
ask if there are any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outstanding job, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I return to my comment, which you missed,
Brian, due to your computer malfunction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you learn more from Chris at Michigan
State or from Harvey Hoke while you were a
[SPEAKER_03]: graduate student here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from both of them, so that's a
loaded question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have focused on microscopy for most
of my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly inherited that phenotype from
Harvey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my approach to this presentation
was a very Harvey-like approach to this
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: A serious question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you stained for DNA in the matrix,
perhaps, of those Canadian?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you expect to find?
[SPEAKER_03]: Secreted DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've tried to use DAPI because we
were hoping to image nuclei as this
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see when mitosis is triggered relative
to germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And DAPI doesn't work that well in live
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really what we would need is a
histone marker for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably wouldn't help us with
secreted DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess DAPI probably would work with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I had that in mind when we
looked at those DAPI stains for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I may have missed it if there was DNA
in the secreted matrix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed your seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your microscopy just blows me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, you solved the mystery that
for many years working with that organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're trying to optimize inoculum
production, we looked for germinability,
[SPEAKER_00]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: viability, using watch slides and looking
at germination at 6 or 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why couldn't we get that germination rate
higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've answered a great mystery there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're trying to achieve nearly 100%
germination, we will routinely deposit
[SPEAKER_02]: spores and then agitate it with a pipette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll get nearly 100%
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fundamental stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things I was thinking about as
far as some of the implications,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly, of some of your findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with the dispersal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things occurred to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To enhance the chances for stalk rot
infection, enough of the spores need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get past the leaf blade and make it down
behind the leaf sheath to be near the
[SPEAKER_00]: stalk rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't all get bound up on the leaf
blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know, but maybe that would
allow for more of the spores to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the leaf sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just a thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that occurs to me is that
Ralph Nicholson did work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: found a germination self-inhibitor when
the spores are all crammed together in
[SPEAKER_00]: that acerbulus that probably are prevented
from germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dilution factor, the idea that,
you know, a clump of spores landing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: droplet, some would adhere and some would
be allowed to wash off, would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution factor, too, to kind of dilute
out whatever germination self-inhibitors
[SPEAKER_00]: might be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a mechanism you might think
about a little bit, too, going along with
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point about the
self-dermination inhibitor being diluted
[SPEAKER_02]: as part of this coin toss mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I want to add that to the
conceptualization of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Brian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I always ask impossible questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to ask, like, how do you think
this is like a kind of universal thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: like all those fungi that have,
like, curved spores?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you expect to find a similar mechanism?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be surprised if we saw it with
other fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: How universal it is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that it's not outside of,
I don't think it would be wild thinking to
[SPEAKER_02]: think that fungi that cause foliar lesions
that are water-dispersed might have
[SPEAKER_02]: similar mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that matter, maybe even aquatic
fungi, we think of fungi that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, float down a river and get
snagged on leaf debris or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anytime there's water dispersal
that a mechanism like this might be at
[SPEAKER_02]: play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether an aerial or dispersed fungus,
like, you know, the fungus I'm used to
[SPEAKER_02]: working on, Aspergillus nedulans,
I'm not sure the mechanism would work
[SPEAKER_02]: similarly in a fungus like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so interesting and so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love to see the sort of living fungus
because I usually just kill them when I
[SPEAKER_07]: look at them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tristan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed your talk and your
microscopy is absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I may have missed this
during your talk, but I was really
[SPEAKER_01]: curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when knidia are being liberated from
the respective knidia spores, have you
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to observe any patterns in how
the spores determine where their actin
[SPEAKER_01]: initially concentrates, whether there is a
factor of light or initial orientation,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that actin concentration more or
less random?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've actually tried to ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to my banana model, my camera is
in a different place here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what the question is,
I think, is, is the actin right or left
[SPEAKER_02]: handed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a sidedness to the points.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the scar from the knidia genus
cell and there's the tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can distinguish those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tried to address, is the actin
always made on one side or the other?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure we've convincingly
addressed it yet, but the preliminary data
[SPEAKER_02]: we have shows that it can be formed on
either side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there doesn't seem to be a preference
of sidedness for which side it formed on.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think many of us get to connect
with Brian throughout the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we look forward to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's all thank Brian again for a
really great seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
