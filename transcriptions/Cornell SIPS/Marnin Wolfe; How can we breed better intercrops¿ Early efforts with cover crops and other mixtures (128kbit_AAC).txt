[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, thank you so much,
Ginny, and also to Solveig for inviting me
[SPEAKER_00]: to be here and showing me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just hugely excited to get to talk to
this particular group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny's had lots of familiar faces,
so many that aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I will tell you about my
background,
[SPEAKER_00]: but OK, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason that I was here from 2013 to
2022, actually, I was here for about six
[SPEAKER_00]: years, then moved remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I worked on the Next Generation
Cassava Breeding Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hired by Jean-Luc in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really the time of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was the time of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fell in love with plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suppose I was working on food
security, providing decision support to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeders in the cassava breeding
project, mainly during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've done now is shift gears a
little bit, trying to run my own breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my focus is on cover crops and maybe
breeding for sustainability aspects in our
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am at Auburn University now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auburn is all the way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of west of Atlanta or in
central eastern Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the land grant institute for
Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was appointed as assistant professor
of quantitative genetics, which means I
[SPEAKER_00]: can basically work on whichever cropping
systems that are funding, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: fundable and that are supported by
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of motivation and work
around cover cropping, as well as forages
[SPEAKER_00]: in Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have set up myself as the Auburn
University's cover crop and forage
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding lab and trying to support
southeastern growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research focus that I kind of have
taken on is breeding for intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm mainly going to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have really been starting a breeding
program from scratch at Auburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several successful forage
breeders in previous years at Auburn
[SPEAKER_00]: University that have developed especially
forage legume varieties and germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my kind of first job was, but the last
one had retired in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my kind of first job was exploring the
cold room and trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of germplasm we have lying around and
what will actually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the cool things taking on cover
crops and forages is I get to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: probably too many different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm going to focus today and just
talk to you about my sort of primary
[SPEAKER_00]: species that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving to work with, which is crimson
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Trifolium incarnatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super common around this region,
but it is super common where I sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had several releases of crimson
clover from Auburn University in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had germplasm to get started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the lead cover crop legume
in the US, at least according to their
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, and I honestly didn't
appreciate this fact until I took on work
[SPEAKER_00]: in this area, it's a cool season legume
and it's allogamous, which means we're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding an open pollinated species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know there's some self-compatibility
in crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, those are my problems now
to figure out how to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have genomic resources in
crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one study published in the past
with AFLP markers in the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working, I'm not going to talk
much about it today, but one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: we are working to do, build a crimson
clover reference genome, do some
[SPEAKER_00]: re-sequencing, try to understand the
population genetics in this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I go into the actual work
we're doing, I'd say the most tangible
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing that I do and I have done in
the last couple of years is grow a team
[SPEAKER_00]: that work with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two PhD students working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two master's students and also an
undergrad, Anthony, who's actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start a master's degree in just a
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a postdoc, Cynthia Gogo, started in
September of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am really fortunate to get to work
with these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of them actually came out of the
cassava breeding and genetics world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of speak the same language,
which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're a little bit of a diverse group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just to say before I go on,
starting a breeding program and learning
[SPEAKER_00]: from the angle I came at all of this was
not as a plant breeder, maybe more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular breeder, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting a breeding program that
includes field work and that kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: takes a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to ask a lot of questions and
depend on a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to try to name names,
but I'm very fortunate to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing people, including the cover crop
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Network, which I'll mention in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting breeding program also takes
funding, and I've been fortunate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an Alabama Ag Experimental Fund
that helped us pilot some of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually gotten some funds from
Alabama Cotton Commission and Wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed Gains Checkoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're supporting cover crop breeding
activities, at least so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two USDA NIFA projects that are
supporting the intercropping work I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: JGI is helping us develop clover genomic
resources, and two of my grad students
[SPEAKER_00]: have Sare grad student grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been really tremendous to help
us get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, talking about needing a
lot of help, I've partnered up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover Crop Breeding Network, who I more or
less assume this audience knows about this
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, but it's led by very own
Jenny Moore, coordinated by Salvi Canson.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great community putting me with a group
like I was working with, with NextGen
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, so I started by just
planting a rep of an advanced line field
[SPEAKER_00]: trial two years ago, and they actually
asked me to be the crimson clover breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: lead for the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that puts me into a position I'm
actually a little more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provide decision support to the various
breeders in the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a collaborative of plant
breeders, agronomists, soil scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all collectively working to develop
improved varieties for cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three legume species that we focus
on, winter pea, hairy vetch, my favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a cereal rye breeding
program, and we have a winter canola
[SPEAKER_00]: program as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each species has one or more different
breeding nurseries at different sites
[SPEAKER_00]: across the nation, with breeders focused
on those particular populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my role is really to sort of crunch the
data and provide decision support when
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to make culling or advancement
decisions, as well as I am now doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: for my own crimson clover breeding
program, which has been really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in case I forget or shouldn't forget
to actually mention, cover crops are those
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're planting to benefit the soil
and the subsequent crop, rather than for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are crops that we're growing to
benefit the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a myriad of different potential
benefits when you optimize them,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually I classify the benefits of
cover cropping as services, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: called ecosystem services, suppressing
weeds, scavenging nitrogen, helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit, prevent erosion, those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There at least have been in the past
economic incentives that also support
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to plant cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of cover crops are,
some of them are, you can see them
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately, like having a cover crop
residue can prevent a washout when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have heavy rains in the early season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them you have to practice for
a long time to build up soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon or improve the aggregate of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long and short term benefits aside,
those are the reasons that cover cropped
[SPEAKER_00]: acres are increasing year on year
nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across most of the commodities groups,
down where I sit in Alabama, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a pretty, we're higher than
the national average for cover cropped
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a number of other
researchers who are mostly in the area of
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy, but also variety testing are
working on cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the CCBN, each species has some of
its own breeding goals, and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into those in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we're selecting for high
biomass and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: High biomass, the amount of cover crop
residue is the chief thing that we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaluate how much of those benefits the
soil may actually get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that I want to add to this,
at least today, is the need to select for
[SPEAKER_00]: performance in mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple pie chart from cover crop
survey that shows that 65% of farmers who
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop plant mixtures when they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually that's grass, legume mixtures,
but sometimes they're planting like up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 species or huge numbers of species
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to select in these
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so finally, an outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you first some
conceptually about breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping, why to do it, how to do it,
and then try to talk to you about actual
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts that I've been making to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will spend most of my time talking
about a cover crop mixture project,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is focused on crimson, clover,
and oat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to mention briefly,
a small project I have with cassava and
[SPEAKER_00]: cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but definitely not least,
a project I have with Jean-Luc and others
[SPEAKER_00]: who may be familiar to you that's focused
on grain intercropping with oats and peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so most of what I'll talk about
came from two papers we published in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of years, a perspective
article I wrote with Jean-Luc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey Cantar, and Nick Santantonio,
and also a review paper that Ginny led
[SPEAKER_00]: about plant breeding for temperate
intercropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intercropping is any time we're
planting two or more species and or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars in the same place and or time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my very, it's a big umbrella
term for a very broad practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be as many intercropping
practices as there are people who plant
[SPEAKER_00]: intercrops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be categorized different kinds of
ways, basically based on how the crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're planting are spatially or
temporally segregated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give too many examples
just to say that my focus has been full
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures, meaning the pair of species
we're talking about are mixed in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: hopper, planted in the same furrow,
they're growing in the same row,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to interact with each
other for better or worse for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why intercrop?
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a whole talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it depends on the intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be very reductive here and
give you basically two kinds of reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: that intercropping can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is like we like to see over
yielding, meaning that if we plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture on an acre rather than the two
species in monoculture, two half acres say
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a better result, higher biomass,
higher economic value of the intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's of course the ideal that we're
going for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what always happens,
but that's the reason to try to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other kind of reason is something
we often, we refer to a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: loosely, multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just be simple about this and say
it means more species, more features,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, cereal rye as a grass can
help with nitrogen retention, but mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to produce a lot of biomass,
add a lot of potential carbon to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: P is a legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fix nitrogen, add some N
that wasn't previously there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're meaning here is if you have
rye and P, you can get some of the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's a bunch of steps we might
go through to set up a program to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a figure from our review paper a
couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of simplify this down
rather than walk through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we need some enabling
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to kind of say like the
motivations and the funding and the
[SPEAKER_00]: product profiles we need to target are
there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's assume that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think like geneticists and breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, we need to like actually make
sure there's genetic variation for
[SPEAKER_00]: performance in intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there isn't in our germplasm,
we're doing a management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be focused on agronomy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming there is, then we're going to
have to ask where the variation is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, genotype by management
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if like it shows here,
there's no interaction effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So varieties are not re-ranking at all
between environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just keep your breeding
program as is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Select for the better of whatever it is,
and you'll get something that's better for
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're typically going to find that
intercropping is a different environment
[SPEAKER_00]: than monocrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have more simple like
non-crossover interactions, I would say we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have rank changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do your breeding for intercropping
under monoculture conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what we're, of course,
going to want to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant breeding is hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already got our breeding programs
operational, presumably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're usually selecting under
monoculture for monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can avoid adding brand new field
trials or instituting a new pipeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I think most of us are going
to want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say like at this point,
if we're going to keep selection under
[SPEAKER_00]: monocropping, we can reach for indirect
selection, meaning sometimes called this
[SPEAKER_00]: the trait-informed approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to identify phenotypes that are
expressible in monocrop but predictive of
[SPEAKER_00]: performance in intercrop, and select for
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really going to focus today on the
situation I think is going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have crossover interaction,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that are best for monoculture
are not those that are best for intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that's the case, you're going to have
to institute some co-evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to breed for
intercropping in the actual environment
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are where you have
intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my very simple continuum of
possible co-testing strategies with the
[SPEAKER_00]: simplest being what we'll call a tester
scheme, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep the germplasm
primarily separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take all of species A and
evaluate them with a few exemplars of
[SPEAKER_00]: species B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do the reciprocal all of
species B with a few exemplars of species
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call them testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite end of that, we're going to
collide two entire germplasms as early as
[SPEAKER_00]: we can in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some kind of a novel
breeding pipeline that does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a brand new thing and
potentially a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not always going to do that kind of
joint evaluation, but what I want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about is how we can actually do that with
some of the modern approaches that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't have to invent a lot to
get this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategies to breed for intercropping have
been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I think, the first paper that
describes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1985 by A.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, hopefully, you can see that this
might resemble a hybrid breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have two heterotic groups,
but instead we've got two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're not crossing species with
each other, but what this is meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate is we're going to have a field
trial where we assess members of both
[SPEAKER_00]: species co-planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will then use those data to make
rankings, breeding values, and make
[SPEAKER_00]: selections either in species A and or in
species B to generate new progenies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to have to,
of course, be able to test them when
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper also described how we can
genetically evaluate an intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some different models than what
I'll show here, but this is basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it a general and specific mixing
ability model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has direct analogy to a combining
ability model used in hybrid breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to evaluate a response
variable is going to be the total merit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the intercrop, the combined yield from
your plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cover crops, that's just going to be
the total biomass, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: For others, it might be an economic merit
index or whatever you might be focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in this model, we have two main
effects, one for each species,
[SPEAKER_00]: we like to call this a general mixing
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the average performance of a
genotype and mixture with any other
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype of the alternatives of the
companion species, and we have a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing ability term, an interaction term.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the performance deviation of
particular combinations of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: species, of cultivars of the two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the statistical or the genetic
models that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some idea of what the breeding
strategy might look like, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to do this is we're talking
about breeding in genetics with more than
[SPEAKER_00]: one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One species is generally enough for most
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge number of possible
combinations and interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by species, by management,
by environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot to navigate and parse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just take the genetics, like the
genetic component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite easy to imagine 200 lines each
per cohort, for any given pair of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be 40,000 combinations,
which we're never going to try to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: field experiment and co-evaluate all those
combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not replicated yield trials or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might imagine, that limits what we
can do in a conventional phenotypes-only
[SPEAKER_00]: selection paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to, in that case,
evaluate all or at least most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations that we want to have a
ranking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We end up limited to the late stages where
we have a low amount of genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, we want to reach for approaches
that allow us to evaluate intercrop
[SPEAKER_00]: performance or whatever the trade is we're
interested in as early in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline as we can so that we can enrich
the downstream results for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, to increase selection
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reach for basically two components
that are fairly common these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we can use a sparse design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using these commonly to capture
genotype by environment interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to replicate all of your
genotypes multiple times in each
[SPEAKER_00]: environment across every single
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For intercrops, that means we're not going
to have to evaluate all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations, at least if we're mainly
interested in that main effect term,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the general mixing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example from a small study that
had 28 peas and seven barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 28 peas on the columns,
barley's on the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be 196 combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this article, what they were able to
show is you can get good estimates of the
[SPEAKER_00]: general mixing ability term by just
testing 64 combos with the critical
[SPEAKER_00]: feature being that we have every pea with
two barley, every barley with eight pea in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other component, hopefully,
that we're going to want to reach for is a
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic relationship matrix to connect the
data from multiple environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in this case means intercropped
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to test as many intercropped
partners or environments as we possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is to use genomic
relationships plus the sparse design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, I'll kind of show you the main
figure from the paper we wrote a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I want to show is, so we have this
grid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our sparse design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of the individuals of one
species and all of the individuals of
[SPEAKER_00]: another species we might want to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're only going to sparsely test
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every member of each species gets
tested with several members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the filled tiles there are basically
the ones we might select for a field
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then three and four here, I'm just going
to go quickly over three and four here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to plant out a field trial,
collect the relevant phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to genotype everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, we're going to be able to
fit a genomic enabled model of general
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can allow us to do two types of
selection, the typical two that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, variety development and
population improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we can select all of the
best combinations and advance them into
[SPEAKER_00]: some trial where we're actually test those
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be selection for variety
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other part is, of course,
improving the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably a bit optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is, we're going to run a
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, through multiple
cohorts, make selections, make crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve or co-improve the system as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one other thing I wanted to
show is we also can simply, in direct way,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate genomic relationships into
this general mixing ability model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can simply include a genomic
relationship matrix for oats, for the oat
[SPEAKER_00]: GMA, for pea, for the pea GMA,
and a chronic or product of the two can
[SPEAKER_00]: help us to capture the interaction term,
the specific mixing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, that's going to mean that
I can make a prediction of even the
[SPEAKER_00]: untested combinations and their
performance, as well as the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: values of each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those that we haven't feel tested or
that we haven't feel tested in
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: With what time I have, I want to tell you
about what we're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, we have a project that focuses
on cover crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to use both genomic and
phenomic selection to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focal system I chose was crimson
clover and oat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a listing of cover crop species
that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're used in mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cereal rye is the most common cereal
that's used for cover cropping and in
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of folks where I sit are very
interested in grazable cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oats have a little bit of a higher forage
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose crimson clover and oat for
this project for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a project that's funded by
a USDA NIFA and an Auburn Intramural
[SPEAKER_00]: grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My collaborators include Dr. Esteban Rios.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a forage breeder at the University of
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a crimson clover breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually met him when he gave a seminar
remotely, when he gave a seminar right
[SPEAKER_00]: here a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some partners at Auburn,
physiologist Alvaro Sanchez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yin Bao is now at the University of
Delaware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our new phenomics expert is Tenzil
Rehman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very grateful to the Sun Grains
Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Harrison and Ali Babar are small
grains breeders in the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have basically donated oat lines
to the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our major goal with this project is
basically just to pilot the ideas that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just shared, using a sparse design and
connectedness from genomic or phenomic
[SPEAKER_00]: information to evaluate these mixing
ability terms as early as we can in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I show you how we're going to
integrate this into crimson clover
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program to tell you how we
actually breed crimson clovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the things I've spent
the last couple of years kind of wrapping
[SPEAKER_00]: my head around and figuring out how to
make progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with evaluating single plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space plant evaluation, we do it in a
pollen isolated way as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plant as far from any other crimson
clovers because whatever we let flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bees are going to decide what the
mating scheme is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of our genetic units is basically its
own special individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to have to do some kind
of culling selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 10% to 20% is much more serious
than I actually use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to allow just the best
plants to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to collect seed from each
individual plant so we can track the
[SPEAKER_00]: maternal lineage at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we're of course not going to know
the pollen parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those maternal seed lines then go
obviously to the next year's space plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an allogamous annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cycling every single year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, we can get in the second
year our first opportunity to do biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: yield kind of trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often call these sword plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, each plot is going to
have a half-sib entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each plant may have the same maternal
haplotype, but that's the main connection
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we do with the seeds
from each space plant nursery is comprise
[SPEAKER_00]: a synthetic line or a balanced bulk from
the best, say, 50 to 65 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a single seed lot from each
nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we enter that into the CoverCrop
Breeding Network's advanced line trial
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multi-location, like 15 sites up to
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we get our first biomass
yield and CoverCrop performance metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: compared against major commercial checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the test bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll determine what might be valid to
release in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now I can tell you how we're going
to integrate genomic selection into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: or specifically, genomic selection for
mixing ability with oat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our initial space plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the selected plants and their seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at this stage that we're going to do
genotyping of the half-sib families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those half-sib families are then going to
be used to comprise next year's nursery to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the next balanced bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I want to add to this
is a yield trial where we can evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially both sets of genetic units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called this a preliminary yield and
mixtures trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see here, we have a bunch
of single row plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of them has a different
crimson clover half-sib with an oat
[SPEAKER_00]: companion to compete with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the idea is we can then use the
combination of the genotypes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: half-sibs and the phenotypes that we
collect in the yield trial to make genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction and kind of intercept the seed
on the way to the next year's space plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery to try to increase the intensity
of selection and incorporate the
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction for general mixing ability at
the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trial is going to be four site
years, total two locations times two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually just finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hopefully be harvesting my second
and final yield year of this main
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment next week, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have single row plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, they were just six feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we've got 12-foot long plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better see the yield last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other important features of the
experimental design, we have around 200
[SPEAKER_00]: entries per year that we ran, 178 in the
first year, 200 this year, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: advance lines that are currently in CCBN's
ALT series.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept the oat lines consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they're inbred lines, it's at least
a little more relaxing than having
[SPEAKER_00]: everything cycle every single year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kept the 26 oats constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with 1,200 plots total,
or 600 plots per location year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you context, instead of
going into all the details of how we set
[SPEAKER_00]: up the partially replicated design,
there are 4,628 possible combos of the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of germplasm that we had last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, we've sampled about 22% of
that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 1,020 combos, as you imagine,
with 1,200 plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I explained with the sparse design,
most of them are unreplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are replicated so that we can
get better estimates of interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip over this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to mention another wrinkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our first attempt to actually
do genotyping for breeding in crimson
[SPEAKER_00]: clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned we don't have a reference
genome yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose to go with what I would call
frequency typing or pooling by families.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an approach that Dr. Rios has used
in alfalfa and annual ryegrass,
[SPEAKER_00]: among others, successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is we're going to take equal
parts of tissue from 20 plants per family,
[SPEAKER_00]: pool it, isolate the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used low-pass sequencing from Hudson
Alpha Institute's Kufu platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ended up aligning our reads to the red
clover's reference genome for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up with 3,700 markers,
approximately, that we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is we're sequencing to
capture allele frequencies and
[SPEAKER_00]: co-frequencies between the families,
rather than genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not plant-level genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can construct a genomic
relationship matrix from this and use it
[SPEAKER_00]: to make predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just to mention that we're looking
at a whole bunch of different phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to talk briefly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a bunch of non-destructive
sampling, mainly with multi- and
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral UAVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like seven time points per site
per year have been flown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, cover crop termination
time, we take the biomass, we separate by
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and get the dry biomass per
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our primary yield component and
the two phenotypes that I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, while I have been dabbling in
genomic prediction using last year's data
[SPEAKER_00]: set, my graduate student, Gideon Oyabode,
first PhD student to join the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been working on the UAV data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he's done is he's taken the seven
time points per location.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken both the spectral reflectances
that come directly from the drone,
[SPEAKER_00]: also vegetation indices, like NDVI's,
and used that as the predictors to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic relatedness matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intermediate step here is basically
doing spatial correction of the spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: readings and to get blues for each crimson
clover family, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I end up with a single value for each
of these predictors for every crimson
[SPEAKER_00]: clover family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we end up with a relationship matrix
that's number of clover by number of
[SPEAKER_00]: clover matches the genomic relatedness
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very preliminary work,
but without further ado, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to show is that we have
detectable genetic variation for both
[SPEAKER_00]: crimson clover and oat mixing ability from
the first year of this field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two traits are all I'm gonna share,
total biomass and the proportion of that
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass that's crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the proportion of variance
that's from genetic sources, parsed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: sources specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no specific mixing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our trial's definitely set up to target
that general mixing ability term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the bulk of the
genetic variance appears to come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: clover, and most of that's really captured
by that genomic relatedness matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not much directly from the genomic
relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a good first step,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have statistically significant genetic
variance to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I did was to look at those
predicted breeding values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of wanted to figure out
what's going on in the germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: start to think about how we would use this
for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's each dot is either a clover or
an oat accession with the X axis being
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion clover, Y being the total
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we see a significant trade
off, a negative relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes perfect sense really,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oats that produce a lot more biomass end
up corresponding with being less
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible with crimson clovers,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas basically we need to be selecting
for bigger clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is the hypothesis we would
have gone into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass-legume mixtures, usually the grass
is the more competitive member.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably need to be breeding for
more competitive clovers and less
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive oats, sacrificing some of the
total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's one of the things we can
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we want to know,
can we make genomic predictions with these
[SPEAKER_00]: data?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to predict two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mixture performance, which is going to
be mixture total genetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the combination of the
predictions for both species and the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also, of course, interested in the
breeding value prediction for the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm running clover breeding
program and that's what I want to use to
[SPEAKER_00]: select what goes to the next nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different resampling procedures
we could do for cross validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For brevity, I'm just going to talk about
the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to resample the clovers,
but you can also do resampling with the
[SPEAKER_00]: oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hardest thing to do, of course,
would be to resample both species at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, test the ability to
predict combinations where you've observed
[SPEAKER_00]: neither the clover nor the oat before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to show the clover
resampling for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do some prediction of especially
the mixture performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shown here in the teal would be the
prediction accuracy for the mixture total
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are resampling the clovers here,
the oats are essentially, their genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships are always in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that a lot of this prediction
accuracy comes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically treated like
environments for the clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got very small or let's just say
modest prediction accuracy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first attempt, small marker
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's greater than zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, we also have been
using the drone data to try to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships between clovers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing is when you include the
phenomic relatedness matrix, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: teal here, we get much improved ability to
predict the clover general mixing ability
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of conclude this little
bit here, I think I have more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key things, we do have significant
variation for clover and oat performance
[SPEAKER_00]: in mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that oat biomass productivity
trade off to contend with suggests we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to select for less competitive
oats, more competitive clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clover mixing ability prediction is
ability is small, but phenomic prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: does very significantly improve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think open question I need to
consider carefully is how I should
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use that and be happy to hear
thoughts about that at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots to do to get better at
working with crimson clover and genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction in the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably need a bigger population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We most certainly need bigger plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get them from bigger seed yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to develop the reference genome
and get an idea of actual population
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic parameters like effective
population size, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's it for clover and oat mixing
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to spend a few moments and
tell you about cassava and calp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the tropics or in the global south,
this slide doesn't specify specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: show that, but it is a fact that
intercropping and polyculture production
[SPEAKER_00]: is much more common than it currently is
in temperate systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems just very obvious that we if
we're going to breed for intercropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most important places it's
going to be done, it would be in tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you guys know, with cassava for a
lot of years and my graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: Gideon actually worked with the Calpe
breeding unit IITA after he worked firstly
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cassava breeding unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we got to talking about what he
would do for his PhD, it was like obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: we should try to see if somebody in our
cassava network wanted to plan an
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping trial with cassava and
calpe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gideon set up this trial and pitched it
or recollectively pitched it to Dr. Ismail
[SPEAKER_00]: Rabi, who's now the head of cassava
breeding at IITA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been super thrilled that
I've gotten to keep collaborating with
[SPEAKER_00]: him, even if it's just on this small pilot
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's basically run it for me gratis so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to share with you the very first
year out of two that we're going to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: run of this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically we have 120 cassava clones
that we chose from their existing pipeline
[SPEAKER_00]: PYT and AYT stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gideon chose two calpe, one that's an
upright type and one that's a spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask me too many questions about
calpe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observe them in both mixture and in
monoculture, unlike the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment that I just described where we
only focused on mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were two replicates with a two
row design like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cassava and the calpe are planted
in the same row directly with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to know is that they are
planted together, but not harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost more like a relay,
I would say, because calpe's are short
[SPEAKER_00]: season, three months to four months
maximum before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava takes 10 to 12 months before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like nine months,
the cassava are actually alone in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field after the calpe's come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honestly betting against there being
any impact on the cassava at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's actually not what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indeed, when you inter crop cassava,
regardless of the type of calpe that we
[SPEAKER_00]: try, cassava root yields and by various
metrics are somewhat decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true for the calpe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're inter cropped, they have
lower yield than when they're monocropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's not the same thing as saying
that the inter crop itself is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the one result I want to share is
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ranking of the cassava clones or
120 cassava clones relative to a parameter
[SPEAKER_00]: called the land equivalent ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply the ratio of the yield
observed in inter crop to the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: observed in monocrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the green, we have LER cassava
greater than one, meaning these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually yielding better when we inter
crop them than when we monocrop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not showing the details of the
mixed models we fit, but we can also show
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a significant genotype by
management interaction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those collectively say that we
have some motivation to breed cassava or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least to evaluate cassava under inter
crop conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do that if we want to
figure out which cassava would be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: for inter cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope we can use this pilot project to
sort of launch additional work in this and
[SPEAKER_00]: other kinds of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so last but certainly not
least, but definitely the most early
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, I have this really cool project
with Jean-Luc and others that's focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: a temperate grain intercropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a project with oats and peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Peter Hyde and Leah Treffer
for this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing that I want to say is,
so we plant the, these are again,
[SPEAKER_00]: full mixtures of oats and peas that we
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key feature here is if we get maturity
correct and we can successfully combine
[SPEAKER_00]: them together, oats and peas have pretty
different seed size and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be separated after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically all I'm going to say today is
that we have kind of a breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping dream team assembled that
includes, again, Jean-Luc, Peter Hyde and
[SPEAKER_00]: Leah Treffer from here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have both an oat and a pea breeder
on the project, deriving lines directly
[SPEAKER_00]: from their breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Juan David Arbalaes may be a familiar
name around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is our oat breeder at the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nono Bendio started off as our pea
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now at North Carolina State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if I got that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Marisol Berti, who's an expert in
intercropping at North Dakota State,
[SPEAKER_00]: is managing the pea breeding program
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a partner at Corteva,
both Sarah Lira and Frank Techno,
[SPEAKER_00]: and postdoc Annabelle Laurent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these folks are, each one of us is
planting a single location of this field
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually planted mine in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume that will happen sometime soon in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to like go over all the
different objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically or in some ways the same
as what we were doing with crimson clover
[SPEAKER_00]: and oat, that is we want to pilot genomic
prediction of intercropping ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this huge latitudinal range,
like we're really spanning a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a USDA NIFA plant breeding for ag
production, Coordinated Innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really mouthful kind of grant name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this will allow us to do two years of
primary field trial series and sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementary third one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going until 2028.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're deriving our germplasm
for oat and pea directly from middle stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the breeding pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: All told across the couple of years of the
project, we're going to have 480 oats and
[SPEAKER_00]: 430 peas, or somewhere in that ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each of us is going to plant 400
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 location years will end up being run
total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we'll have 4,000 total
intercrop plots, which would mean with
[SPEAKER_00]: this number of oats and peas anyways,
that's 211,000 combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to the 22% of the space that
I searched with crimson clover and oat,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually searching less than 2% in
this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really excited about this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're just reaching about
elbow high, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my field site, things are growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw some flowering peas just
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so stay tuned for more on this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I'll finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding for intercropping is definitely a
major combinatorial challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that the normal things I
like to throw at problems, genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions, sparse testing, will help us
do early stage evaluation for these
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need empirical examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what I'm up to these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to hear your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, you have this GMA
estimate that's between two species.
[SPEAKER_02]: How correlated do you think that would be
to essentially intra-species competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: How correlated the general mixing ability
to?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you don't have the answer yet
what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, is competitiveness within two
individuals within a species, is it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of the same process as that GMA process?
[SPEAKER_02]: The SMA, I totally expect to be very
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was kind of wondering, do you think
that's going to be turned out to be 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: correlated?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often called the associate effect
or the indirect effect of one species on
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for time, there's a whole other
evaluation model where we will separately
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze the separated yields, like just
the clover biomass and just the oat
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you fit that same model with the
main effect and the interaction term,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main effect for the alternate,
like if I'm analyzing clover biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the main effect for the oat in that
model is telling me about the oat impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that can be actually added to the
GMA for clover to give me, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to the producer effect for clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little hard without showing the
model, but that's directly actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: measure of the competitive effect versus
the sort of, so a producer effect would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the species own effect on its own yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the associate effect is the species
effect on the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can basically break that GMA down
into those components and then think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do with that for breeding
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I can say from a little bit
of preliminary results that Jean-Luc has
[SPEAKER_00]: shared from some of his work with oats and
peas, there's a negative genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation to some extent between the
producer and associate effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, more competitive something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a sacrifice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I just wanna say awesome talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in thinking about like G by E of oat
planted by itself, are you seeing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: where G by E would be higher or lower when
it's planted with pea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just papered over that so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're asking if there's actually less
G by E when we have an intercrop versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: monocrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have some ability to try to
estimate those components.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not done it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was your question, whether it's a?
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher or lower, but if you haven't,
then that's like totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what would you expect, I guess then
I'll pose it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I would like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is fine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know from betting against
cassava being affected by Calphe intercrop
[SPEAKER_00]: that what I would expect might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one question online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does climate effect pollinators,
does drought, heat effect yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is this factored into the way you're
sort of setting up your program?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say those things are, I mean,
relative to the intercropping projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have multi-location trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially trying to also
estimate the G by E term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that as a question about the
impact of environmental variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been trying to focus just on
the genetic component, mostly main effects
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than those interaction terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also a follow-up with one of the
pollinators for clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it was geared a little bit more
towards pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your fears and impacts of climate
on pollinators?
[SPEAKER_00]: So bumblebees and all kinds of other bees
love clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no expert on all the specific species
of their pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my master's students actually is
interested in that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll see what she can actually
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have too much knowledge about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the environmental effect,
one thing that I do think that we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: when we can dig into, especially soil
fertility, when you have a higher nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, that really benefits the
grass and causes the grass or the cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: to out-compete or to be more competitive
against the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover can fix its own nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a lower N environment,
and I think that's going to be a major
[SPEAKER_00]: confounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of spatial variability,
I observe myself in the first year from
[SPEAKER_00]: one end to the field to the next,
we went from more oat, less clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: to more clover, less oat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you why, because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are definitely confounding
factors that we have to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by spatial corrections, how I've
handled it so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you highlighted some of your pros
that conventional growers would want to
[SPEAKER_04]: have intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic producers have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they have fewer tools to deploy,
to control, and have these benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you giving any additional
consideration in your program to organic
[SPEAKER_04]: producers and what they're looking for in
the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, especially breeding cover
crops, organic producers are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my best customers or my best
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, so far, I work on a conventional
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have an organic farm that I can
yet do plant breeding and genetics kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: work on yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely contend with the issue like
planting intercrops, like of oats and
[SPEAKER_00]: peas, for example, immediately excludes
the vast majority of any chemistries that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no post planting herbicides,
for example, by definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's exactly an answer
to your question, but we have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have a very basic question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're deciding a crop,
or you're thinking about a crop to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crop, what are the key
characteristics that it should have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a lot of people in this room
could answer that better than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we're typically, not always,
but most of the species we're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about are cool season species because
where most of the commodity production is
[SPEAKER_00]: warm season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to be winter sort of hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also needs to be able to deal with,
nobody puts fertilizer or adds,
[SPEAKER_00]: uses herbicides or anything to control
things in a cover crop field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole idea is farmers are busy,
they're going to harvest as soon as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can, and then they have to plant a cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to spend extra money,
buy the seed, plant the seed, spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing that the cover crop has
to be able to do is survive on its own in
[SPEAKER_00]: a low fertility or low kind of care,
and it has to compete against weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main three traits we really are
breeding for in the cover crop breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: network are biomass, of course,
but then early vigor, which basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: means getting big as quickly as possible
so that we have some weed suppressive or
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion control kind of benefits in the
early part of the cool season and then has
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive over the winter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
