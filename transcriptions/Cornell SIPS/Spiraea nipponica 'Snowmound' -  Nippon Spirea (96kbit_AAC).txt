[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spirea nipponica or nippon Spirea,
a really underutilized Spirea,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a bit taller, so three to four feet,
and very small dark green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the ID features,
maybe a half-inch leaves up and down the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem, as well as you have the persistent
fruit, which goes up and down the stem in
[SPEAKER_00]: this arching pattern, which the shrub will
show white flowers in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tough, drought-tolerant and
shade-tolerant Spirea and underutilized.
