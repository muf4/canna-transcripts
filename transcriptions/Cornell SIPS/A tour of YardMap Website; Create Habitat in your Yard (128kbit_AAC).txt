[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jacob Johnston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with the Project YardMap at the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: science program aimed at creating habitat
in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the YardMap application
online and the website and how we use
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: YardMap essentially allows scientists to
better understand how landscape use and
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening choices affect birds and
wildlife populations in residential or
[SPEAKER_00]: urban settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of coexistence, we're realizing
also that a greater diversity of birds and
[SPEAKER_00]: a greater diversity of plants and wildlife
around a neighborhood or around a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people improves their well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true in almost any demographic
and almost any society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what YardMap seeks to do is
collaborate with groups of people to join
[SPEAKER_00]: people together and to create a community
of YardMappers, a community of people
[SPEAKER_00]: making connections or connecting points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connectivity is a very big concept in
ecology that connects large expanses of
[SPEAKER_00]: wild areas through small expanses of wild
areas like yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: One yard that's YardMapped and is being
managed for wildlife is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two yards is even better because that
provides stepping stones from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a national forest to Lake Saranac or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have these stepping stones of
habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have stepping stones
connected, you have corridors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have corridors and stepping stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a community works together to
provide all the necessary or essential
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of a habitat across the landscape,
that's when we can all make a really big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to do is show you some of
YardMap
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the best practices that we
suggest and some of the tools that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: for planning it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our new homepage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of demonstrates what I was just
referring to, the actions of you and your
[SPEAKER_02]: community, and create a larger,
more efficient and useful habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an anatomy of YardMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A YardMap takes a Google image of your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You outline it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you fill in the habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you place objects like trees and
bushes and bird feeders on that habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates a YardMap like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our active participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding habitats or objects to their yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do, when you add,
say, a native flower garden to your yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tells the scientists here at
YardMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here on this top bar, we have a lot of
resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Explore resource will show you how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take you, if you put in your zip
code here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will show you your plant hardiness
zone and your ecoregion and give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: list of bird reports, local experts,
state's native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really nice link here that gives
you suggestions of available plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's places where you can buy
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's places where you can get
together with community events that are
[SPEAKER_00]: around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all based on your zip code and
plant hardiness zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that YardMap
allows or provides a resource for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the learn articles,
which are constantly updated articles
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to best practices, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native lawns, replacing, non-native plants
with native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're escaping, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can think of, rain barrels,
cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just a lot to learn from
that section there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we, the citizen science part of
it here is the mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's our, this is an example here of
a map that's been created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can take a look at some other maps
that have been recently created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there is a project going on up
in Canada where they are encouraging
[SPEAKER_00]: elementary schools to map their schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these sections has been outlined
with a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each of these trees replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just take a quick second and show
you a little bit of mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first you find, oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: First you would find your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say this is my house here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use a site outline tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick whether you're using a home or
it's a school or a community garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can map farms, parks, preserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have something else that's
unique, like we have a couple of yard
[SPEAKER_00]: mappers that map their balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they live in a giant apartment
building, but they have a wonderful garden
[SPEAKER_00]: on their balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they use this other to just map the
balcony.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to pick a home and I'm going
to assume that I know the boundaries of
[SPEAKER_02]: this house, this property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what it takes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, use a habitat tool to
outline the lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be really rough about this,
but I'll show you some intricate examples
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some forest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the dots are movable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either expand the range or you can
move the whole piece around like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this gives us area and type of
habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't give us everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens next, once these things are
mapped, you go into the characteristics
[SPEAKER_02]: page and you can put in information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call my house, my home,
the characteristics page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have a garage or is it a home?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then like we want to know about the
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a green roof or does it have
a white roof?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because white roofs help with albedo
effect with warming of the climate around
[SPEAKER_00]: you and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put in some comments and you can
upload photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for almost every object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every object has and every habitat is
going to have these characteristics that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can include information for,
like the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use an electric lawnmower or a gas
powered lawnmower or push reeled
[SPEAKER_00]: lawnmower?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to have a different
collection of characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the entire area filled,
I'm not going to fill it right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once this area is filled, that's when
you go back through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find, you go to the object tool and
you can start adding trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say this tree, I'm not sure what
happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give me one second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't seem to want to save for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's the tree.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you open the tree, you can type in
the type of what you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say I have a big swing in the tree or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an interesting part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put in this and say it's a red
maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put in Acer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I start to type, species lists will
come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the citizen science data
comes in really handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then we have species and abundance
in each of these properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that you can
do with Yardmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we are going to be starting
to really integrate the Yardmap with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other citizen scientists programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I open this site again, I can list
all the birds that I have seen on this
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this uses the eBird citizen science
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you do here is you add data to
the eBird program through the Yardmap
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that ties them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually what we would like to be
able to do is connect nest watch and
[SPEAKER_00]: feeder watch with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you put a bird feeder,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find a bird feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of objects down here on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look, there's planters,
cactuses, everything from wildflowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: bat houses and bee nests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a bird house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a bird house in the lawn here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it won't be long before you can
connect your nest watch data with the bird
[SPEAKER_00]: houses that you put on your land or on
your Yardmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you notice here, Yardmap is in beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are constantly growing and expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now it is very usable and very,
very fun to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of people that enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really glad that folks like you
are interested in learning about it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can take it to your communities
and put it to use and get feedback for us
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Cornell Lab of Ornithology and
provide much better habitat,
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient habitat for... I'm sorry,
I seem to be losing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, if anybody would like to see
anything else, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a quick demonstration of
this, but it definitely takes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a learning curve to learn to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, here's a... And some exploring to
use the website here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get the hang of it,
it's fast and a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a lot of extension members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of people that work with
groups, using this with their communities
[SPEAKER_00]: to create groups and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've been focusing on
recently is... Let me see if I can give
[SPEAKER_02]: you all a sneak peek.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a live site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are working on now is this
groups function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that work with the communities,
people that work with others, like
[SPEAKER_00]: community gardeners or planners to
collaborate together and to work together
[SPEAKER_00]: in a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new function that we're
starting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these groups, you can find a group to
join, you can start your own group,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can create... Let's see,
you can... Let me see if I can pull one up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you can compare your group
to other groups and you can compare
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves within the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a group that's a native
lawn group and you're all trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the least amount of lawn on your yard and
the most amount of native plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, then you can compare each
other's efforts through this group
[SPEAKER_00]: function here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will probably be live in a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to look forward to
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start working through the
learn and the explore tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, after the group
functionality that we're working on now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next part, the next tool that we're
going to add to the yard map network is
[SPEAKER_00]: called a planning tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be a second map that you
sort of lay over the map that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you first will assess what you have and
then after that, you can plan what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want and yard map will make the
connections for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to put in a native garden,
the yard map may pop up and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's native plants for your area that
will work to attract the birds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: listed you want to attract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's sort of using the
resources to explore on your own,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very soon it will be one that is a
planning tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A planning tool that gives you the
resources and suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you would do is go to the explore tab
and put in your zip code here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the best resources that I've
found that we've found for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions is this, your state's native
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you to the Lady Bird Johnson
Wildflower Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will give you a suggestion of
native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can filter that suggestion
too if you want trees or if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: bushes or if you want them to flower in
June or if you want them to be dry site
[SPEAKER_00]: type flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of ways you can filter
the selection to get kind of what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dry site that gets lots of
sun with acidic soils and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: something that gets about four feet high,
you can enter all that into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 16,000, almost 17,000 sites
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some sites in Mexico,
lots of sites in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple in like Costa Rica,
a couple in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to work together with
the Google Earth or the Google Maps to
[SPEAKER_00]: make that more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the software isn't as accurate
as it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lining up a Google Earth's
picture with our mapping tools doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have some difficulties outside
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and Mexico seem to be fine,
but any further outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to do with projections,
with map projections and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the engagement is always going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number was 200,000 acres mapped just
a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've almost had 40,000 acres mapped in
a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are always coming back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no commitment to come back to your
map, although we do try to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to always be adding and changing
and updating what they've done to their
[SPEAKER_00]: yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any changes you make to your yard,
we want to know about it and then know any
[SPEAKER_00]: differences that may have come about from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I say, there's no commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as often as you want or as few as you
want, we try to keep people coming back at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once a year with any changes that
are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a tree fell over or they changed their
gardening techniques or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yardmap.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
