[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to thank Adrian for a very
generous introduction, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: over-generous, and I want to thank you for
coming to hear this talk, which may never
[SPEAKER_00]: be given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I chose modeling as a topic for
my presentation because it appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly relevant and very timeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can share a little bit of personal
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking up in my diary, actually in
my journal, and I found out that within
[SPEAKER_00]: two days in 1978, I actually gave my
entrance seminar to the department in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the choice of date seems particularly
apropos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference, of course, was that the
seating arrangement was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screen was in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the chairs face that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of having a computer with
PowerPoints that don't work, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: two-by-two slide projector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which did work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which did work, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a botanist, a zoologist, and a
mycologist walk into a bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm not going to touch anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to touch the clicker,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm actually going to turn off the
lights because I'm a morphologist and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: used to working in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the reason I picked the topic is
because it appears that modeling has taken
[SPEAKER_00]: a new high road recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a quote from a 2016 NSF
report talking about the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological modeling and the fear that it
might actually fall between the cracks of
[SPEAKER_00]: funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly NSF and a number of other
funding agencies have taken note that
[SPEAKER_00]: biological modeling is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no higher authority than Wikipedia
actually has an entrance talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: biological modeling and the systems to a
variety of biological disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think talking about modeling in
general is particularly interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you, when I was a graduate
student and I started doing my first
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling, it was actually frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thought to be mostly, you know,
smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people really didn't trust
mathematics or at least not mathematics
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to biological systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only point of entry in the old days
was really in ecology where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological modeling had become
fashionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I talking about when I actually
am using the word modeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to Webster's Dictionary and of
course looked up the various definitions
[SPEAKER_00]: for model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, representation of a person,
a thing, or a phenomenon, or a system that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a model person, a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kind of definition that I want to
use is a material visual mathematical or
[SPEAKER_00]: computational analog used to construct a
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice to construct a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice the entrance says see also
hypothesis or theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I mean by modeling,
at least in the context of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what drew me to look into modeling is
that ever since I started studying
[SPEAKER_00]: biological systems, I've always really
been fascinated by the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between organic structure and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been interested in that for a
very long time, even actually as an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate major in mathematics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't help but look at a plant
or an animal and think about its structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and its function that could be quantified
using the tools of math and physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another dimension, however,
and that is my background in PhD thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: had to do with evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the other axis in this interest is
how the environment influences the
[SPEAKER_00]: interplay between organic structure and
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the historical aspects that have led
up to the structure function relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually is an interplay of at
least four very important components that
[SPEAKER_00]: converge on our understanding of what a
plant, a fungus, or even a bacterium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start looking at the
application of the physical sciences
[SPEAKER_00]: towards biology, being a physical
scientist, it's actually comparatively
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a little list here if you're an
engineer or a physicist of what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're designing a structure,
a mechanism of some sort, you know where
[SPEAKER_00]: that mechanism is going to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The workplace is already specified for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the design specifications are
specified for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is the machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is the structure that you're
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the function of that structure is
already specified a priori.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an engineer is given a task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is where you're going to build
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it has to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the materials and the
materials that are going to be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: fabricate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't work, you can choose a
different material, aluminum instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, with very few exceptions,
engineered artifacts have a single
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that you can design a
structure to actually maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of that function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in physics, not in engineering,
but certainly in engineering, one accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: and precise measurement can actually
suffice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, biomechanics and biophysics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here is where we get into a little
bit of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organism has to be examined,
and its functions have to be inferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to guess what something is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a wing, a fin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pretty much be sure that our guess
is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many things, like,
for example, the prickles on a rose,
[SPEAKER_00]: these downward nasty looking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they really doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they grappling hooks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they deterrent suburbivores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they doing both?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that an organism's
materials and structure are the result of
[SPEAKER_00]: its evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the evolutionary legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get there de novo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through a whole sequence of
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, at least in terms of
biomechanics, most organic structures have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple functions, not just single ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't maximize the performance of
the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to compromise and
optimize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, in biophysics, multiple
measurements are required, unlike physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often tell my students, some of whom are
here, and I'm not sure I've told them
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measure an electron accurately,
you know the mass of an electron
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measure a gerbil, you happen to
know the weight of that gerbil on that day
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have many challenges, not the least
of which is that many biological models
[SPEAKER_00]: appear overly simplistic because of the
multitude of functions that organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: even a single cell, has to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the classic example there is a
sumaspherical cow existing in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a lot of us sometimes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a spherical plant existing in a
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can imagine it, but I'm never
going to find one, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that things have certainly
been improved, not improved, improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is our modeling techniques are a
lot more sophisticated with the rise of
[SPEAKER_00]: computational sophistication, computer
engineers now can handle data sets that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my day, nobody would ever accumulate
because they knew they couldn't do a
[SPEAKER_00]: single linear regression on it,
because in my day, you had to do it by
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem that we face is that
models can give the correct answers for
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you an example here of
Ptolemy's astrolab, this little device
[SPEAKER_00]: shown over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could predict the motion of the
planets, the known planets in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could predict solar and lunar eclipses
with perfect fidelity to reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one little problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a geocentric device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It assumes that the Earth was in the
center of the solar system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave you the right answers,
but from a mechanistic understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solar system, it was totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so with all of these caveats in mind,
I'd like to give you a few examples of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of modeling that I did starting way
back when most of you, at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: younger ones, weren't even born.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel totally antiquated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I want to talk about is
tissues and deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adrienne mentioned that my PhD
involved looking, at least in part,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this strange little organism called
protocellviniate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some SEMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, SEMs were new when I was a
graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all very excited about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are SEM micrographs of this
fragment of this organism called
[SPEAKER_00]: protocellviniate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an upper Devonian thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really knows whether it's an alga,
a liverwort, or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that I was
fascinated with was that if you look here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make out cellular texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see how those cells seem
to have been aligned with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've blown it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are little black pencil marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the arcs of these different
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to myself, self, what can we do
with these data?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new technique that I became aware
of was called finite element analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finite element analysis is where you
make up essentially grids with properties
[SPEAKER_00]: within each of these areas that,
in my particular case, were the dimensions
[SPEAKER_00]: of these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spend many nights with a micrograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: A microscope measuring the size and the
shape of these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mesh things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you create, based on the information
that you have, a hypothetical apical
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, by the way, is a finite element
simulation of what I thought the meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty with finite elements is
then you can say, grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make this thing bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construct what the organism might have
looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to go back one or a few
slides and point out that you'll notice
[SPEAKER_00]: there are things here that are very
different in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bilobed things and squashed
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that look like Mickey Mouse's ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I came along, those were all
described as separate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protosalvinia ravina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protosalvinia arnaldii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protosalvinia furcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, maybe my little computer
simulation will generate one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be vindicated to get at least
part of a mini PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turned out that the computer
simulations told me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those fragments belong to the same
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them could be generated by
manipulating the cell divisions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the computer simulations actually gave
me an ontogeny for this fossil organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you validate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just pie in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually go and look for the
intermediate stages that were never given
[SPEAKER_00]: a name, a species name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got my PhD because after macerating
tons of material, I did manage to find
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my PhD committee sort of said,
well, this is a computer simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really paleobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK, leave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Adrian also mentioned, I was doing some
organic geochemistry then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a dilettante.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had at the University of Illinois a
beautiful mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we prepared specimens, vaporized
them, did all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I managed to isolate a number of
compounds that are thus far only known for
[SPEAKER_00]: land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's likely, even though this has
nothing to do with modeling, it's likely
[SPEAKER_00]: that protosalvinia lived on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make it not an alga?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because it's not mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in the definition of an
alga that says you can't live on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just prejudice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got interested then in, oh,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is we have a loose connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not touch this computer again
except to start the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested in, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaking hands, because you might not know
it, but I'm terribly nervous giving this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very impressive group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking at tissues later on,
after I actually came to Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about finite element analyses and
how I could apply it to living plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fascinated by hollow things,
including my cranium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at a variety of plants,
including equizetum, you will see that
[SPEAKER_00]: hollow stems are actually very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out, from an engineering point of
view, they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you bend or twist something
like a hollow stem, if you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of lenses, the maximum lenses
are always towards the outside and towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reason to have stuff on the
inside, since it's not providing any
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical support of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you eliminate that biomass,
you actually make the material lighter and
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why a lot of things like
bicycles and frames of airplanes are made
[SPEAKER_00]: up of hollow tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, what can we do with hollow
tubes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can bend and twist them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I meshed up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love finite element analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And said to myself, what are the effects
of these nodal septa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Periodically, the internodes are separated
by a nodal septa, a little diaphragm of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also on many grasses, the base of the
internodes is classed by the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, the leaf sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to know, well, what are the
contributions of these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we twisted, and we bent,
and we looked at finite element
[SPEAKER_00]: simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that the nodal septa
provide almost 25% of the mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: support of these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as struts that actually absorb
bending and twisting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb the strain energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the applied force is removed,
they act like a spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop back into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could actually show this using real
plants and measuring with strain gauges
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of those diaphragms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the secretaries here many years
ago, Joan Miller, she liked to knit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would get one of her long
knitting needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get one of these stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd punch through all of the nodal
diaphragms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd measure the bending strength and the
twisting strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd compare that to a non-surgically
manipulated grass or equizetum stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we confirmed that 22.5% of the
strength of those structures were the
[SPEAKER_00]: result of the nodal diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 17% is actually provided by the
sheath that surrounds the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts like a girdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, therefore, in the proper place
to absorb most of the strain energy along
[SPEAKER_00]: the internode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then went into a whole field of
engineering called cellular solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As botanists, you're all used to cellular
solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about parenchyma,
it's a cellular solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a liquid phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a solid phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that cellular solids have
a number of properties, biomechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, that are influenced by the
pressure of the fluid inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in engineering, styrofoams are an
example of a cellular solid in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid phase is a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In botany, the fluid phase is a liquid,
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we predicted the effect of the
thickness and the radius of the cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: in these cellular solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we submitted these to tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, a computer model could
be validated within a 5% error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting pretty happy with this
kind of work, which is still being pursued
[SPEAKER_00]: in my lab, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ongoing biomechanical questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerodynamics of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm switching topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to my graduate days,
I was taught these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the oldest known seed
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are my watercolors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are reconstructions of what the
ovules looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're upper Devonian, lower
Mississippian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go by horrendous names that I had
to memorize, like Salpingostoma
[SPEAKER_00]: hetsonensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You not only had to memorize it,
you had to be able to spell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore, because nobody really cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was taught, when I was a graduate
student, here you see an ovule that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much like a modern day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the micropyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the integument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at some of these other
little critters, this is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: megasporangium surrounded by what looks
like a dead squid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were told as graduate students that
this evolved from an ancestor that looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, and that the coalescence of
these squid-like tentacles and their
[SPEAKER_00]: fusion towards the tip was a consequence
of natural selection operating on
[SPEAKER_00]: protection from herbivores, from little
mandibulated terrestrial arthropods,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would go in there and eat the little
eggs and the little magnetic mutified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was a very cute story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I also knew that these things were
wind-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least I was told that they weren't
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't around in the Devonian,
upper Mississippian, but not the Devonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, self?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this might be protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the influence on pollen and
so I built myself a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the contraction cone of the
wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan and the regulator are all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might wonder what that tube is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the big gadget that was really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a bubble generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by a bubble generator?
[SPEAKER_00]: It used a surfactant to create bubbles,
individual bubbles, that were filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had a centrifugal device over here
that you could actually select the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubbles that you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size of the bubbles that I wanted
were bubbles that were neutrally buoyant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the weight of the little
soap downward was counteracted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting force of the helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could actually see a bubble hover
in motionless air and not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you shine a big bright light on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing now are these
little bubbles moving around a cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking down on the cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the leeward side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the turbulence that's
generated on the downwind side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we had a way of visualizing airflow
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed to photograph them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed to know what they were doing
from the top and the bottom to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: construct for three-dimensional airflow
patterns around these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built little scale models using clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you see, in each case,
the airflow is coming from the left to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see an impaction zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these particles were just hitting the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice there was a stagnant area where
turbulence was being generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a little bit excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a long, many series of
simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the airflow patterns,
the statistical Lee most dominant airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, especially around the receptive
parts of these structures to see whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not there was a bias that might carry
pollen towards the micropile or the
[SPEAKER_00]: micropile-like structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got really fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made what we called pseudo pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could construct little things that were
like pollen, only they were bigger so we
[SPEAKER_00]: could see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we coated the surface with sticky
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put them in a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would see happily, would they come
near the micropile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not all that exciting because
it was not conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I built small little models and
used like podium spores to see what would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that the structure
that looks most like modern day ovules
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was the most efficient at
capturing pollen around the micropolar
[SPEAKER_00]: lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just a statistical study in
which we looked at the maximum pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually towards the micropile,
critical wind speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the structures that look
like modern day ovules were the most
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient at the lowest wind speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least it suggested that maybe the
evolution of the integument might have
[SPEAKER_00]: been under two pressures from natural
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is protection and one is for capturing
wind pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, why do I have to work
with dead things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can work with living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of wind pollinated things
like pine and grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all grasses are wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's one that grows in the
tropics described by Bauer that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: insect pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see Jerry Davis going like this
rather than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started working with pine cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a little photography,
got a little bit better that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually look at very small scale
turbulence patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found here was that there were
three things that an ovulate pine cone
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it produces cyclonic vortices that
wrap around the orthostiches and
[SPEAKER_00]: perostiches of the scale ovuliferous brach
complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were also little doldrums between
the axis of the cone and each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was backslip kind of
turbulence and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pursued it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next big invention was a
stroboscope, stroboscopic lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we broke those streamlines into
fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the successive images of my
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's nice about this is since I know the
rate at which the light is flashing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can measure the rate of movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I could not just look at patterns
of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could look at distributions of local
velocities, which from an aerodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view is much more impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just want to point out that when
you're dealing with fluid mechanics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have two ways in which you can analyze
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is called an Eulerian approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is called the Lagrangian
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an Eulerian approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as if you were staring out a window
and looking at everything that came by
[SPEAKER_00]: that little piece of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Eulerian approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is Lagrangian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is you actually follow what a
particle is doing along its trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to do both to really get an
understanding of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Eulerian diagnosis of an
ovulate cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is velocity in meters per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just look at a little bit of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at all the pollen grains or
all the bubbles that are passing through
[SPEAKER_00]: that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you begin to quantify what its
material, what its fluid mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was, yes, there was
inertial impaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, pollen grains would just
hit the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was happening is that the airflow
patterns created by the ovulate cone
[SPEAKER_00]: itself biased the sediment tation of the
pollen grains on the upper surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ovulate bract complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was actually a very sophisticated
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, it's a turbine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not rotating around its axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's causing the air to rotate around its
axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's biasing the distribution of those
airflow patterns to get pollen towards
[SPEAKER_00]: where the ovules are, which are in the
adaxial surface of the bract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't want to just use models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a real pine cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real pine pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are photographs of the worst of our
experiments, because there's just a cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see little dots, but nothing
conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we refined the technique, refined the
technique using stroboscopic lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to blow this little piece up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These now are the successive locations of
a single pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You digitize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You computerize this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you crank out the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the Lagrangian approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at individual pollen
grains moving around a real ovulate cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found out was rather surprising,
because when you actually look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of pollen grains that are hitting
the ovules of different species of pine,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here are the ovulate cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the pollen grains from those
ovulate cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is the pollen that is
most successful comes from the species of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cone to which it belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is selective filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of noise, a lot of randomness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wind pollination in this case is not
random.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very deterministic component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got into computer simulations,
real computer simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are artificial pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at what are the dimensions
and densities of pollen that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal for different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a phedra.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ovules of the phedra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the little pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pollination droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to get into all of these
stories, but I can lend you reprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we did the same thing with grasses,
using real pollen from the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we digitized them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the aerodynamics around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, we were looking here at
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at two different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Ceteria geniculata.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very compact panicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The florets, flowers, are very close
together, something like a pine cone in
[SPEAKER_00]: overall appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Grostus heimalus, which has a
very loose panicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see little clusters of flowers,
but on their individual stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fluid mechanics around these two,
dense panicle, loose panicle, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, as you might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing is we noticed that the
loose panicle was a natural harmonic
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these little clusters of flowers
on the stems of different length,
[SPEAKER_00]: different stiffness, they were oscillating
in different directions and at different
[SPEAKER_00]: speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the Ceteria panicle was
oscillating in a very predictable natural
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could actually measure the harmonic
frequency of these things using a biaxial
[SPEAKER_00]: optical transducer that could actually
track the motion of this thing in all
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could put it through a
Fournier analysis, and you would get the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural harmonic, the second harmonic,
the third harmonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out, let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that you could actually not
only talk about the aerodynamics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we now could talk about the material
properties of the stems, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural frequency is related to the
stiffness of the material, to Young's
[SPEAKER_00]: modulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this got us interested in solid
mechanics and the interface between solid
[SPEAKER_00]: and fluid mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just giving these examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to go into all the
detail, besides which they're
[SPEAKER_00]: excruciatingly boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're published.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what else do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, as Adrian mentioned,
I was an undergraduate major in
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always fascinated by the symmetry of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at a plant, and you just
say, it's beautiful, but it's beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: because in part of its symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got interested in phyllotaxy,
the arrangements of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you a few examples,
a disticus example in Clivia, opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: decussate in some kind of mit,
spiral arrangement, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all these beautiful symmetries
that seem to conform to what is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: Fibonacci series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phelios de Bonacci, the son of Bonacci,
name contracted to Fibonacci.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Phelios de Bonacci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what he did is he created these
wonderful mathematical kind of series.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add up the numbers, and you get the
next number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you add up the previous number to
that number, and you get the next number,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next number, the next number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start with any number,
but you just use this mathematical series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make fractions of them,
like here, and you keep increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, they converge on the golden mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can convert these fractions into
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the series will always approach,
expressed in angles, 137.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or thereabouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this excited mathematicians in
botanists for hundreds of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, because the golden rule now,
that plants have learned the golden rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they arrange their leaves the
way they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a long time ago, we created a little
mathematical model for the arrangements of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on a single stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need only a few parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the deflection angle of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the rotation angle of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the distance between successive
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the divergence angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Fibonacci series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can play around with the
leaf, the length of the petiole,
[SPEAKER_00]: the width, and the length of the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept things simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: All leaves are either ellipses or circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: No low being nothing, just to see what
would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can create all of these different
philotactic patterns here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're looking down on a kind of
rosette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put these mathematically into a
computer and say, OK, the sun is going
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead from dawn to dusk.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much energy do these leaves
collectively absorb?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is their efficiency at trapping
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have morpho spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a morpho space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, we have the Fibonacci
angle, the divergence angle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the amount of energy a plant can
absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this is the angle,
and that's the actual fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really the same axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wherever you see this big,
broad line here, that's the golden mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: 137.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see for little stubby
rosettes, or rosettes with what look like
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza kind of shovels, or for round
leaves, that really the optimal is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fibonacci convergence series, 137.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute you start playing with
internodal distances, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or patio lengths, things of that sort,
the difference between all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: divergence angles of leaf arrangement are
washed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is no better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only time that the golden mean
seems to work is if you're a cabbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a rosette, where all the leaves
are basically shading each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you start elongating or
changing the geometry of the patio or
[SPEAKER_00]: change the deflection angles of those
leaves, it doesn't matter how you arrange
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which is really good for Clivia
because the leaves are in two different
[SPEAKER_00]: rows, and it doesn't seem to bother it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also could simulate the effect of
latitude and things of that sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you play with latitude,
all of those leaf arrangements can be
[SPEAKER_00]: equally efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two more to go, and I'm going to
go through it, I hope, in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is your opportunity to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early land plant evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I was taught paleo botany,
we were all excited about the Devonian
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's when everything seemed to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My professors were excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the plants from the
Devonian, they're actually excruciatingly
[SPEAKER_00]: boring.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, if you were a taxonomist
today, you might classify all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things into one family, or one something
or another, and just give them different
[SPEAKER_00]: generic species names, binomials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the beauty of these plants is that
they're botanical tuning forks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can mathematically describe their
geometry with only a few variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know, again, the bifurcation
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the angle between bifurcations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the rotation angle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the probability of branching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that I could include are
diameter and length of these elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can create a universe of all
mathematically possible structures in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly simple Cartesian coordinate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go n-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be three-dimensional,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Descartes, there's that little
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have x, y, z.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know its coordinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add other dimensions?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, other parameters to
describe the morphology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add more axes and forget about being
three-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way to deal with this almost an
infinite number of axes is you line them
[SPEAKER_00]: up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this point and that point and that
point and that point and this point and
[SPEAKER_00]: that point are all the same points.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an object in n-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let anybody tell you that you
can't plot more than three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Computers can handle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is slices through the morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just took three slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get things like psyllodum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get things that look like real trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get things that sort of look like
conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to things that look like
a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And years ago, I gave this talk in New
Zealand, and I said, well, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, you haven't seen our
varicating shrubs, have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, there are stems that
grow inward, not outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, that's them over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have this morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turns out that I can quantify the
performance of those morphologies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually calculate their ability to
intercept light, to conduct fluids,
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce, and to provide mechanical
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written books about how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my gross self-advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you free copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody buys them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have made a fortune with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the best cure for insomnia that I
know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even read more than three pages
and not stay awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you an idea, you move the
sun over something like this, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate its self-shading, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at mechanical stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the moment arms, the influence of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at the probability of
discharging spores and the distance those
[SPEAKER_00]: spores travel, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can quantify the performance of
each of those objects in the morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I can do is I can simulate an
adaptive walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can start someplace here, maybe the
earliest known vascular land plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can look around in that morpho space
next to it and say, is there anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just as good or better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the computer finds that morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps doing this until it gets to a
morphology that is surrounded by nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's better or as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an adaptive peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to know, does this really work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that this is Salicornia
europa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little halophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like one of these boring Devonian
plants, but it's actually an angiosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had a trifurcating kind of
branching pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was the geometry of this
plant changes dramatically depending upon
[SPEAKER_00]: the density of plants, how closely they
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we simulated density's effect on the
ability to intercept light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared the morphology of the
plants at different plant densities to the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology that the computer predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, we were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Computers are wonderful things until they
fail you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, OK, let's look at the Devonian
plants for different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we tested is light
interception and mechanical stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do them simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a conflict, by the way,
because if you want to be mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: stable, you want to be vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to maximize light
interception, you want to lie on your
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the opposite of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to optimize, not maximize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started with Cooksonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the earliest known vascular plant
fossil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found its location in the morpho space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the computer says Cooksonia
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we go through the adaptive walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to very quickly show you what was
happening is that the computer was
[SPEAKER_00]: predicting with successive events to go
from something like a rhino like plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with equal branching to unequal branching
to overtopping to then lateral branches
[SPEAKER_00]: that started to planate and that looked
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really curious is that that's
exactly what the telome theory predicts by
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimmermann.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you get megaphils.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what he thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the computer said, yeah,
Dr. Zimmermann, you seem to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with something like this
is it's an opaque model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just telling you what the basis is of
your assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the way, only two functions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanics and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you just want to maximize
each performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you put these in pairs or
triplets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what happens when you say, do them all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to show you walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens when you have single
functions, maximizing repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production, conservation of surface area,
maximizing mechanical stability,
[SPEAKER_00]: light interception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what happens when you do two
functions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't read off all of these,
but you'll notice things are looking a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you have three functions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you do all four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all equal in their performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many ways to make everything work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of fun, because what it's saying is
if I'm a single function like a machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maximize the performance,
my fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I keep adding functions,
the number of tasks increase, so do the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of equally efficient phenotypes,
but their global fitness is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of explains why when you drive
into the desert, all the desert plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all trees look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're equally good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine if you're an engineer and I
say design a toaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how about a toaster and a hairdryer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to go on to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to end with this so that you can
all have lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I want to talk about is forest
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real forests, very complicated,
but it turns out that if you go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and you start looking at trends
within sizes and girths of trees in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different forests, you find
very strict allometric relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the log of standing leaf mass
versus the log of standing stem mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that's a log-log linear
regression over many orders of magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: from forests as different as conifers and
mixed deciduous forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are rules somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sean Hammond, one of my graduate
students many years ago, had a knack for
[SPEAKER_00]: computer simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Sean, how about modeling
forests?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me and he said,
will that get me a PhD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking at rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was given to us by this
gentleman many hundreds of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Apollonius of Tyane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember his theorems from when I took
geometry, complex geometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he was a little younger then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was interested in how do you
package things together?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, how many circles can I get
into this kind of geometry?
[SPEAKER_00]: He noticed, this is the arc of a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the arc of a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the arc of a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had some mathematics that we
began to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started introducing those rules
into the computer simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another problem that we had was,
how much do I give to make new leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make new roots, and new stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a banking problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get so much energy in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to produce leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to produce stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to produce roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you produce too many leaves with
respect to the stem, you can fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I produce too few roots with respect to
stems, I can fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the classic allocation of
biomass, not money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a beautiful algorithm,
starting with a little seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproductively mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy for reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violate a physical law.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two objects can occupy the same space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the beginning of our
simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were going low density,
and then watching them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher density, higher density,
higher density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, for all of this trauma,
I want to show you a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, I need my glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have to press a button,
and I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking at now is a single
propagule that is reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at it from this side and
looking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a single seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every iteration was one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, that was one propagule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you what happens when you
randomly scatter those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to go for over 600
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little specks you see, those are the
seeds that are being released from the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, you'll see some light gaps where
an old tree dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see some little puppies
filling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is so cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can watch it on Sunday when
you're bored and it's snowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you test a model like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these darn computers, I don't
understand why they don't do what I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see if we can do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you test a model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we looked around for forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was wonderful to find this
publication published in Italian,
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Forenza, Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine, they went out into a new forest
and measured properties for 80 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the girth of the stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the height of the trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 80 years, the School of Forestry just
had new people come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD students go out there, measure the
forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we could do is we could
parameterize our computer model for this
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, Aby's Alba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what I'm going to show you are
graphs that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these symbols is the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other symbol is the prediction of
the computer model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something else that came out
that we never expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The computer model predicted how old the
trees were before they would produce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we found in the data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had cross validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we had an emergent
property that we never put into the
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the program made a prediction that we
didn't expect but happened to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have I learned from 45 years of
modeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to propose a few tools,
and then I'll be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you evaluate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you fit empirical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use the technique called cross
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for predictions that aren't in
the algorithm that still comply with
[SPEAKER_00]: reality, like we did with the Aby's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defining a model's scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to know when a model
is inapplicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the range of phenomena to handle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interpolate, but the danger is to
extrapolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go beyond the boundaries of your
model unless you have data to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, the appearance of
emergent properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appearance of maturation that that
last model predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fallacy of causality is always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correlation, strong positive correlations
do not necessarily prove that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a temptation, but you have
to resist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions, Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to ask about a couple of
parameters that I wonder if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: considered with regard to light
interception because some of your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: look sort of non-modeling,
non-physiological.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, your leaves are not really opaque,
and you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you able to look at what would happen
when they allow 10% truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is the amount of light
exceeds what the leaf needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, if you tip a leaf up,
you get actually more efficient for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, which illustrates what's
happened to corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've upped the yields like crazy by
changing the leaf angles, washing in many
[SPEAKER_01]: more plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those questions are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer the first one, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the parameters would be the opacity
of the leaf, the transmission of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically useful radiation,
because of course a lot of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of it is green, and that's not
particularly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question of leaf orientation,
when it comes to the canopies of trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best assumption is that the leaf
orientation is random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have a leaf like this,
I have a leaf like this, I have a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, and if you have more than a few
leaves, you can basically say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can either model it as a frequency
distribution, or you can just say it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that it doesn't really
matter once you get to a certain size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have so many leaves,
it doesn't have much effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we looked at phenomena like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I never worked on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to ask you for some advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask you for some advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the current state of computer
science and supercomputing, what questions
[SPEAKER_01]: does biology ask if you want to model
today or for the next 30 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I was into metabolomics,
I'd be looking at metabolic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was into genetics and development,
it would be gene regulatory networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was into ecology, it would be
community dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those are amenable to modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model is a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing about a tool is you
have to have an important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the question that drives the choice
of tool, not the tool that drives the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was Sean Hammond's computer
modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw so many emergent properties,
not just the onset of reproductivity and
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation, but a lot of other phenomena
that we never expected a simple model to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like density-dependent depth, which can be
used to model the spread of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there are a lot of applications,
not just to forested communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelsea?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad because it's a regular science
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big picture question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got the model of the forest
community, and then you also have the
[SPEAKER_02]: model of the forms of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have two questions about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, can that be combined together so
that you could actually model the forest
[SPEAKER_02]: community not just looking like a single
plant, but looking like multiple species,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how those would interact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I answer that question first?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't heard the question is,
can you use this kind of model not to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at mono-specific stands, but what happens
when you have different species
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually parameterized a number of
different kinds of trees because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in competitive exclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do one of these things muscle out the
other?
[SPEAKER_00]: In very few cases, we found that
coexistence was the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen, however, if you started
with equal numbers of seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly distributed, you would see that
some species would be repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their numbers would drop below 25% if
you had four, but then they would plateau
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would persist for as long as we
ran the simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that Sean is actually
following up on now that he's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: tenure-track position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is that related to your other
model where you were predicting the forms?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use sort of a history instead of
the potential forms that could be there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're restricted in their history and
their branching patterns and what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use those two models to kind of
inform each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can you use the two
last models that I talked about where you
[SPEAKER_00]: had different forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use them to fertilize one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but when you start modeling
something like that, you have to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: large number of assumptions and the
results will be very dependent on the
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the early evolution land plant
model is an opaque model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not tell us anything about reality,
but what it does do is it makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: logical consequences of our assumptions
transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that those simulations
were done on Atari simulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Atari computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four Atari computers hooked up as a
network, and some of those simulations
[SPEAKER_00]: took months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this built a lot of brownouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would lose the results of those
simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got big computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What took us months could maybe take a few
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the modeling that I did with
finite elements with proto-salvinium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was using Fortran.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stacks and stacks of what looked
like postcards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little holes punched in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dropped and you were scared all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lovely day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
