[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if that stays up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been the director of the National
Museum now for 23 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty phenomenal place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably all been there at one form
or another as a visitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 7 million visitors a year,
which makes it the most visited natural
[SPEAKER_00]: history museum in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 127 million objects in the
collections and 400 scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year did research in 70 countries and
published 392 new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty cool place, complicated
place to get your hands around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool for me about it and the reason
I came from Denver to the museum was that
[SPEAKER_00]: of those 7 million visitors, 85% of them
are unique visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tourists, which means that every
year there's a different 85% of 7 million,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means over a decade we'll see some
like 60 million people in the building,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is amazing, which means that
equivalent of 20% of our nation will walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into that building in a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it one of the most visited
informal science places in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what attracted me there was
this perception that it's really important
[SPEAKER_00]: that we communicate with people about
science in a very effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that kids are scientists
because they're curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow they lose that curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever it is that persuades people
to keep being curious, part of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: this perception that science is a valuable
part of our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting place to be working
because the potential is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential to put those 127 million
objects and those 400 scientists and those
[SPEAKER_00]: 7 million visitors together and stir them
up is pretty cool as a potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun to come here to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came because I was invited by Alejandro
Gandolfo, a longtime collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She and I have worked in Patagonia for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amazing projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And related to what I'm talking about
today, but I'm not going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patagonian stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you get Alejandro up here to
give a talk about the cool Patagonian
[SPEAKER_00]: projects soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also came to visit David Skorton,
who is your president and soon to be our
[SPEAKER_00]: secretary of the Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the handoff is going to occur sometime
next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to come to the Smithsonian on
July 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to get back in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about about
origins of biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this map of the tree
canopy of the world today, you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the world is, by and large, not that
forested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the forests that do exist occur in
some pretty distinct patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tropical rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the bands of boreal forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the coastal rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the deciduous forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a whole lot of white space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a paleontologist who thinks about
deep time, the evolution of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the evolution of the landscapes
that host different kinds of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: particular trees, I kind of wonder how
that pattern came to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with geologic time, you have both the
evolution of different plant lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the continents themselves
are in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: The continents are moving at some fairly
good speeds, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continents kind of trip along at certain
points in Earth history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continents can move several inches a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the millions of years of time
over which plant evolution is happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: the continents are moving around a bay
into each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this phenomenal fossil record
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're so lucky that our planet
buries its dead, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could imagine a scenario where a
planet didn't bury its dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the rock cycle,
as mountains erode and the debris from
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains gets deposited in low-lying
areas, the corpses of plants and animals
[SPEAKER_00]: get buried and entombed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those layers of rock hold the record
of the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can sort of ask the question,
how did that modern configuration of
[SPEAKER_00]: forests actually come to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pathway to get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got additional information
that's kind of interesting and useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dana Royer's curve that shows the
last 600 million years of our best guess
[SPEAKER_00]: at carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and
our best guess of when ice was prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest surprises for most
people is that our present planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: a planet that's frigid on the ends and
warm in the middle, in fact, was not
[SPEAKER_00]: always frigid at the ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been warm in the middle,
but not frigid on the ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, the periods of ice,
there are two great big ice house periods,
[SPEAKER_00]: one around 300 million years ago,
and one for the last 34 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the vast majority of the last 600
million years, the planet has not had
[SPEAKER_00]: polar ice caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our present world is kind of this weird
anomaly relative to the history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes you wonder about how
forests fared in these different worlds,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these greenhouse worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a greenhouse world, ice house world,
two great big mega patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 70 million years shows warming at
about a warm planet at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous, into the Paleocene,
the spike in the early Eocene at 55
[SPEAKER_00]: million years, a really warm period of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a gradual decline about 34 million
years ago, the passage between Antarctica
[SPEAKER_00]: and South America opens up and the world
cools dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It warms back up in the Miocene and it
cools to the present time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really get ice in the
northern polar areas until about five
[SPEAKER_00]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, those earlier ice periods,
when there was no land in the Arctic,
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually unipolar in their ice
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're living in a bipolar icy world for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Earth history for the last five or six
million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the present distribution of forests
must arc through that story somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that ice comes and goes,
the continents move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that'll pop back up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into this dramatically when I was an
undergraduate and got lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend two summers in Ellesmere Island,
about 1,500 miles north of the Arctic
[SPEAKER_00]: Circle as part of an expedition to the
Arctic in search of Eocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: A woman named Mary Dawson at the Carnegie
Museum in Pittsburgh had posited that the
[SPEAKER_00]: fossils that were found in the Paris Basin
in London and the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming
[SPEAKER_00]: were similar enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must have been an Arctic connection
during the Eocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you know, there was some way
that these would cross over the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went to the Arctic with the idea
of finding the earliest pre-Ice Age
[SPEAKER_00]: fossils in the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went to Ellesmere Island,
which is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got about 200 people in it,
mainly Inuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this will keep going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ellesmere in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her first trip in 79, she found
fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found fossil crocodile teeth 1,500
miles north of the Arctic Circle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was surprising to her and everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with her the next couple of years
and flying around in this area that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: far north that there are no trees at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one species of woody plant is the
Arctic Willow, which is prostrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not even bushes at this
latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an area where the permafrost
goes down for over a kilometer in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean annual temperature is minus 30
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three months of sunlight in the
summer and three months of darkness in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the further north you go, the more
that barrier is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fly around, you see
tremendously thick coal seams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coal seams themselves are full of
those white rocks when on close inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually tree stumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at 2,000 miles north of the
nearest tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are stone tree stumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you date these rocks,
they date around 55 to 60 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the peak of that warming, instead of
ice caps, you have forests, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty amazing observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think if you had to say two
words to anybody to talk about the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of climate change, just say the words
polar forests or Alaskan palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's these forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coal seams are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found coal seams are up to 150 feet
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the thickest coal seams in the
world are actually polar forest coal
[SPEAKER_00]: seams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you rummage around in the footage
of these coal seams, you find ample
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conifers are not the pineacy that you
find populated in the boreal forests of
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, in fact, relatives of
Metasequoia, Sequoia, Glyptostrobus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxodium, the Cypress, the warm conifers
that are present mainly in places like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gulf of Mexico and Mexico and the Yellow
River in China, the mid-latitude warm
[SPEAKER_00]: conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the dominant conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find a variety of other things
like these fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And paleontologists and paleobotanists are
experts in fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We primarily deal in fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might not immediately see that as
the, besides the fact that it's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: out of focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not recognize that as the center
part of a lumbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can tweak this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of missing about half,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes and goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I notice as I walk around the
campus today, there's tons of beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: Saucetophyllum trees on the campus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Saucetophyllum is one of the more
common things that we see in these polar
[SPEAKER_00]: forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this interesting world that
kind of looks like central China,
[SPEAKER_00]: except it's 2,000 miles north of the
Arctic Circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those early trips in 84 and 85,
drilled into my brain that the planet is
[SPEAKER_00]: really different today from what it was 50
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a diorama that I built for the
American Museum in New York of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: Arctic 55 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a dense forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these big carifidon animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flying lemurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's crocodiles and turtles and snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lotuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your Arctic in a warm world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we've learned about
the gradient is, today, if you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature gradient from the equator
to the pole, minus 30 degrees at the pole
[SPEAKER_00]: plus 30 degrees at the equator today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the equator to the pole today,
there's a 60 degree centigrade gradient of
[SPEAKER_00]: mean annual temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Eocene, the equator was somewhat
warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly how much,
but let's say 35 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like the polar regions had a
mean annual temperature around 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gradient is much, much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to think about that is that
when climate changes, it changes much
[SPEAKER_00]: faster in the Arctic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a warming climate, it'll warm five to
six times faster than it does at mid
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes, which is interesting because it
means if you want to see the future now,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the Arctic because it's happening
faster there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the Arctic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you go up there, it's quite a
phenomenal place because there's an ice
[SPEAKER_00]: scape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's both the permafrost on land and
the floating sea ice at sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2005, there was an amazing paper
published by an American European
[SPEAKER_00]: coalition that had gone out to the middle
of the Arctic Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a submerged ridge in the
Arctic Ocean called the Lomonazov Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this ridge going across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now about 8,000 feet down in the
bottom of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they drilled the Lomonazov Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brought up seafloor samples expecting
to see the marine foram, the marine
[SPEAKER_00]: plankton record of the ancient Arctic
Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was really startling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found the spores of the floating
aquatic fern azolla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have an Arctic Ocean that,
in fact, not only wasn't producing marine
[SPEAKER_00]: forams, it was producing freshwater fern
spores in great abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's, if you've all seen azolla,
that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were layers in these rocks that
are 47 to 50 million years old of azolla
[SPEAKER_00]: spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this crazy situation of an
Arctic Ocean that must have had a
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater lens on it, which makes some
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a closed basin, a freshwater
runoff into the Arctic Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a freshwater lens lake floating on top
of a deep saltwater basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that lake were floating
aquatic ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a lake in Amazonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to Amazonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great busman's holiday if you ever
want to go experience delightful times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out in central Amazonia there are
these gigantic lakes that are so big you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get on a small boat and not see the
edge of the lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lakes are often totally covered in
azolla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an Amazonian lake that is
actually the Arctic Ocean 50 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, which is actually kind of a very
compelling thought to realize the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: has changed that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people you know have no idea of
the Arctic wasn't always polar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact polar arctics, well that is
technically polar, let's just say frigid,
[SPEAKER_00]: frigid arctics turn out to be the
exception, not the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty unclear exactly how the
physics of that works because we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's more sun at the equator and
less at the poles and the Earth's tilt is
[SPEAKER_00]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how you keep the Arctic warm in a dark
winter is an unresolved mystery that has
[SPEAKER_00]: some modeling progress on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't understand that exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like this is just a chunk of
land that floated up there because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same kinds of fossils all around
northern Russia and in fact Antarctica as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very good well-documented
saga of warm polar regions in the warm
[SPEAKER_00]: world of the Eocene and Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which sort of begged the question to me,
when did tropical rainforests start?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part, a little bit less
intuitive, is where did they start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they happened to be in the
equatorial regions now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that they must have started in
the equatorial regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that might be flawed logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some argument for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to sort of introduce you to my
basic tool, which is the humble leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a paleobotanist, we find leaves pretty
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be a paleobotanist with your
charcolified flowers like Bill Crepe and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alejandra do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could look at pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all great ways to look at
fossil plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fossil plants are great because they
represent plants in many different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree trunks, pollen grains, charcolified
flowers, your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a leaf guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leaves are pretty compelling things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single tree can have like between
100,000 and a million leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I actually cut a tree down once
and counted the leaves just to prove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99,284 was the number of leaves on my tree
or 50 foot tall red maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a leaf like this,
a classic tropical rainforest leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got a couple of very distinctive
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, a very smooth margin and this
elongate narrow tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also called a drip tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was noticed by a guy named Bailey
who used to work here back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And published in 1915, this observation
that leaves are actually indicators of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smooth margin leaves are more common
in warm climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that drip tips are indicative of very
wet places.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tropical rainforests, many of the
leaves have these features.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a survey in Yasuni in Ecuador and
looked at 400 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only like 70% of the leaves had
smooth margins and elongated drip tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a convergent foresting thing that
show up in tropical rainforests in very
[SPEAKER_00]: wet areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all tropical rainforest leaves have
drip tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all have smooth margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the percentage with smooth margins and
drip tips is much higher in wet tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here would be, this is actually my
bedspread in my hotel in Manaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just laid out a sample of leaves
from an Amazonian stroll in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that by and large,
leaves are large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have smooth margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have drip tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a classic tropical rainforest,
modern tropical rainforest looking kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf assemblage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a curve that shows you without
years, but these are the stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Boromian is like 130 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centimanian is about 95 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's from 130 to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from left to right is paleo
latitude with the equator in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: north latitude to the right, south to the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the first occurrence of
angiosperm pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very old slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably better slides showing
this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see is that some of the
earliest angiosperms appear at low
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes, equatorial latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a great data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a strong bias towards
mid latitude, northern hemisphere stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just reflects the location of paleo
botanists more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see that by the centimanian,
at both poles, north and south,
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperms are present at the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So angiosperms appear, Darwin's abominable
mystery, they appear apparently right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the Jurassic, beginning of the
Cretaceous, apparently somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorially, and very rapidly cover the
globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 100 million years, you've got
angiosperms from pole to pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a world with no ice, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think, oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first angiosperms are equatorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical rainforests are equatorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read many textbooks that say,
well, tropical rainforests have been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for hundreds of millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form in the Equators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's diversity, because they
started there a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually look at the fossils,
these early Cretaceous fossils of
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperms, they don't look like tropical
rainforest leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually quite lobed and small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have drip tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Cretaceous leaves, throughout the
Cretaceous, have a tendency to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different shapes that might
even fit more with your mental image of
[SPEAKER_00]: what a deciduous forest would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not an oak, but it looks like
an oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably more closely related to a
laurel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of these repeated
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lobed leaves are pretty common in
Cretaceous flores throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this assemblage is from the last
two million years of the Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got this world where,
where you find them, the leaves don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really look like tropical rainforest
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent a lot of time chasing this
problem around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally found an equatorial flora in
Baharia Oasis in Egypt in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves I found were small,
lobed leaves, right on the Equator a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting question,
like where, you know, if those are
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical rainforests, when did they start
and where do they start?
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to be a little bit more
compelling to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a reconstruction of the
world 80 million years ago, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late Cretaceous, you're confronted by
one kind of dramatic fact, which is there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't that much land at the equator 80
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you wanted to put tropical
rainforests at the equator, there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really much place to put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have land to put a forest on it
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the great open ocean,
the Tethys Sea, separates North America
[SPEAKER_00]: and South America, separates Africa and
Europe and separates India and Asia and
[SPEAKER_00]: separates Australia into Malaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a great big east-west seaway in
the Cretaceous that during the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperm evolution and diversification
was clearly a barrier for the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: large tropical rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big exception being the northern tip
of South America, the northern part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa and the southern tip of into
Malaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be places you want to go
look if you want to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again in Mori, Mori in 2000 published a
book about, a very speculative book based
[SPEAKER_00]: on pollenology primarily about the,
his guess of the origin of tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically proposed that during the
warm Cretaceous, if you warm the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: up, the equator gets drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sort of predicted two sort of
music wetter zones to the north and the
[SPEAKER_00]: south, but a dry equatorial region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ziegler and his students in Chicago
looking at the distribution of different
[SPEAKER_00]: rock types have shown that the horse
latitudes have been persistently dry
[SPEAKER_00]: through earth history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got those deserts north and
south of the equator and the question is
[SPEAKER_00]: was there in fact any persistent wet areas
at the equatorial regions at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other way I backed into this
question was by studying the fossils of
[SPEAKER_00]: the American West and in particular what
happened to plants at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, the event
where the asteroid strikes smushes the
[SPEAKER_00]: dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question was what did it do to the
ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that involved collecting about a
hundred different quarry sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12,000 fossil leaves in the rocks
that had dinosaurs, looking at the pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, the dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw there was a diverse lobed
leaf Cretaceous flora gives way to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: non-diverse early Paleocene flora of
basically wetland plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the picture we saw in North
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that work down to the Denver
basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved to Denver in 1990 and started
actually being around Denver and Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: turns out to be an amazing place because
it's in the Denver basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sedimentary basin that most of the
rocks beneath downtown Denver are Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: Cretaceous or Paleocene in age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first week I was there they were
building the Denver International Airport
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got a call from a workman out of the
airport said we found a gigantic fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I raced out to the airport and what
they had found was a palm frond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which if you've never seen a palm or a
fish might look like the tail of a fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found huge palm fronds all over the
site of the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you fly into DIA you're flying into a
Paleocene palm forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most traumatic experiences
in my early curatorial life was watching a
[SPEAKER_00]: big tracheal bury an 11 foot long pinnate
palm frond.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a big slab of rock that's underneath
like runway 2 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realized that I moved to a museum
that's literally built on the KT boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact the KT boundary is in between the
museum and the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And downtown Denver is in Cretaceous rocks
and in 1992 we found a Tyrannosaurus rex
[SPEAKER_00]: in a backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the 11th known Tyrannosaurus rex at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found several other dinosaurs in
neighborhoods in Denver and we started
[SPEAKER_00]: going out to construction sites and one of
the great things about plants is they're
[SPEAKER_00]: more common than animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might find one dinosaur but for
every dinosaur you'll find thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started collecting fossil leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we collected about 200 sites in the
Denver area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was cool about Denver was that
the Rocky Mountains were coming up exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the Cretaceous period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Denver Basin not only recorded the
Cretaceous-Tyrannosaurus boundary it also
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded the uplift of the Rocky Mountains
and the creation of topography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had landscapes that ranged from near
Montaigne out into flat swampy landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a daft of conditions on a
landscape as well as change through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1994 I was sitting in my office and
this guy walked into my office and he had
[SPEAKER_00]: a cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had been by the side of the road 25
miles south of town on Interstate 25 in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place called Castle Rock Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he walked in carrying four leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves were great big small smooth
margin things with drip tips on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just gotten back from the Amazon
like where'd you get these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said 25 miles south of here on the side
of the interstate highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went down there and dug into this
outcrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the most nondescript outcrop you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there it is a slumped hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those blue tarps are the holes we dug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the guy with one of these
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use some people for scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a 24 inch long leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's like this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we dug into this site immediately and
fossils were pouring out of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we actually found was that there
was a buried soil horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for about eight inches above the soil
horizon there were just layers of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was basically a forest floor that
was flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these leaves are lying in there in
tremendous abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we're on the side of I-25
with 5,000 cars an hour going past us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of media showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were pulling these great big slabs
out of the ground that were curious
[SPEAKER_00]: because people had known about fossil
leaves in the Denver Basin for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had never found a site like this
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This site was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had really big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a great diversity of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of leaves had smooth margins and
drip tips on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like you know it looks like a
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to be latitude 39.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time we didn't know the age of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking well it must be from
the early Eocene because that's the really
[SPEAKER_00]: warm time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was also great was the fossils were
extraordinarily well preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them had cuticle and the leaves
would just simply peel off the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just split the leaf open and the leaf
would just peel off and blow into traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: and get run over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was amazing about it too was that
having spent basically already a decade
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting fossil leaves in the Dakotas in
Montana and collecting literally thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaves and knowing quite well the
Cretaceous and Paleocene floors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain regions, this site
contained many things I'd never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many things that are only known from this
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed kind of odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big beautiful complete things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just 50% with drip tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed that if you were to use those
characteristics to recognize a wet warm
[SPEAKER_00]: place, this place would qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a garden variety leaf from
the Amazon and a garden variety leaf from
[SPEAKER_00]: the rainforest and castle rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we did more work and did the dating of
the site we actually were able to show the
[SPEAKER_00]: site was 64 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not early Eocene but in fact early
Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two million years after the
Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was kind of cool about the site
was it was an in situ site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to say we actually found standing
in place plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here where the hammer is
there's a trunk going vertically and those
[SPEAKER_00]: are roots radiating out on the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to actually uncover the
forest floor itself and see the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: floor which means that we were able to map
then the occurrence of fossils on a
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape next to a highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's as we dug this we dig in with
back hose and then we take the fossils
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we were digging here we realized
that we were following these big trails of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon and we realized that we'd actually
expose the base of quite a large tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rope is a ring of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those other ropes are other linear bands
of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking at here is basically a
carbonized base of a gigantic tree trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we always think
about as when we're casual sloppy thinkers
[SPEAKER_00]: is where are the petrified trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But petrifaction is a process that happens
sometimes in areas around volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most trees don't get petrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most trees rot away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're walking the forest the corpses of
the dead trees are reduced by termites to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide and the tree goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fate of most trees is not to become
a petrified tree it's to become carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you walk through forests you think
about the forest there's not much to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you about the history of the forest
because the trees are basically being
[SPEAKER_00]: returned to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not a surprise not to find
petrified forest but then you realize you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually find the traces of trees
other ways and start to get a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: where the trees were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start to think okay here's what
this place must have looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big trees, small trees and abundant palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again same guy for scale so you have to
adjust your mental thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only abundant palms but a bunch of
different kinds of palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a host of different palms
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something a couple thousand
species of palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palms tend to be plants that don't like
places where the ground is frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably couldn't do too well with
palms here in Ithaca I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the Denver Basin were ample
palms, pinnate palms, costa palmate palms,
[SPEAKER_00]: palmate palms, abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found this beautiful frond
meter-long frond of a cycad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we were digging we actually
realized that we'd found a whole cycad
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 25 fronds laid out and a trunk
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of fun because when you
work for a museum you can just call up the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening news.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came down at five o'clock and we
opened this thing, this outcrop,
[SPEAKER_00]: live at five on the evening news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always striving to communicate science
whatever possible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a reconstruction of this still
unnamed genus of palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to diawan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not diawan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually found next to the trunk in
place seedlings of the palm in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published, we did an analysis using
leaf margin and got a menial temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: around 22 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: A menial precipitation of over two meters
of rain and over a hundred different
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the initial analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we kept digging this site because
there was more road work and each time
[SPEAKER_00]: they did more road work they found more
fossil sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kept going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept finding more and more species
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a staggeringly diverse fossil
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean fossil leaf sites typically have
five to 25 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sites are producing 60 to 70 species
for a single hole in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be equivalent to a single grab
sample of leaf litter on the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually difficult to get 60
species in a leaf that are sampled because
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're even in the most diverse
tropical rainforest in Amazonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only pack so many trees into a
certain amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaf litter is only capturing the
leaf litter from the nearby trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, even if in Yasuni or Manu,
it's pretty rare to get more than 45 or 50
[SPEAKER_00]: species per leaf sample grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting as many as 60 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a rarefaction curve from
one quarry there of just dicot diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: 73 species from 500 specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hyper diverse, 64 million year old,
tropical rainforest, not in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a view of the fossils laid
out, the foot long ruler over there for
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this site really kind of rang my bell
and said what in the world's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this say about tropical
rainforest origins?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went into the literature and looked
for the evidence in the tropics of early
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was after this site that the site of
Cerro Hona in Columbia was discovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is late Paleocene, about six million
years younger than this, as perhaps the
[SPEAKER_00]: best known equatorial tropical rainforest
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a landscape transect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this long hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to cut into the soil a long
length of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that at many places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the lowest layers of rainforest
is, you can see the tree trunks in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then took the complex common tax
and we sensed them along the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you imagine if you're walking through a
tropical rainforest, as you walk through
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest, the leaf litter beneath your
feet changes its composition as you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: under different trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the trees are heterogeneous in
distribution in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're walking through the forest,
your leaf litter will literally change its
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hypothesis was that we'd see the
same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing here is the
distribution of this leaf, CR23,
[SPEAKER_00]: large there, lower here else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go across the ladder,
you can see that these different species
[SPEAKER_00]: appear sometimes broadly distributed,
sometimes local, sometimes spiked all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way across the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there really was this heterogeneous
distribution of species across the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape at the same exact stratigraphic
level, which seems to suggest we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same heterogeneity that you get in a
tropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of these things down below are
things we've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started scouring the literature for
those species in the Paleo-Botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and coming up pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a painting of this reconstruction
of this landscape and what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the cycad,
everything here is based on actual fossils
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exception of the buttresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buttresses are an artistic conceit
that obviously makes you think tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I admit that up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not find any buttress trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little critter there, that's a
Salinodontine tiniodont, which you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever heard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extinct lineage of mammals that
appears in the early Paleocene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because extinct in the Lateocene,
known from probably less than 15 skulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we were doing this excavation,
these guys were driving down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a true story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stopped to take a leak on the side of
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they were taking a leak,
they spotted the thing they thought was a
[SPEAKER_00]: coyote skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought it to the museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it was a Paleocene
Salinodontine tiniodont.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have one of the denizens of
this forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out in paleontology that
peeing is the best way to find good fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people don't look at the
ground until you're actually like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my god, there's a fossil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever feel bad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the context of this site is that in
the Late Cretaceous, there was a seaway
[SPEAKER_00]: that bisected North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Western North America was effectively
a peninsula of Asia sitting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were starting to call this
Peninsula Laramidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a wide sea that at times was
about 1,000 miles wide, 600 feet deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: that separated Laramidia from Appalachia,
or effectively flooded most of Kansas and
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that Colorado is in that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this diagram, you can see
in dark red the uplifted blocks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain Range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Denver Basin, we can actually
date quite precisely the uplift of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the stratigraphic layers adjacent to
the mountains, we see the first appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: of gravels being shed off the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the Rocky Mountains first
breached the surface about 68 million
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this site at Castle Rock is right up
against the mountain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the mountain range was there at 64
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we even find lahar deposits,
which are these volcanic mud flows that
[SPEAKER_00]: come off volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Denver, there were volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because volcanoes are ephemeral,
but the debris from volcanoes gets buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find lahars that are composed of chunks
of volcanic rock and petrified palm
[SPEAKER_00]: trunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's palm studded volcanoes in
Denver sliding off the mountain range into
[SPEAKER_00]: this tropical rainforest landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can see these things coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the location of the Castle Rock
Rainforest, up at the foot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes these things are so
obvious you don't notice them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to Denver, you live in
Denver, they have a thing called the
[SPEAKER_00]: monsoon, which is not the monsoon of the
Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they talk about the Denver monsoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the monsoons are is that in the
spring and the fall, when there's cold
[SPEAKER_00]: weather coming down from the north and
moisture coming off the Gulf of Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get heavy rainfall on the eastern side
of the Rocky Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the monsoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out in a warmer world,
we have a closer, wetter water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can predict much higher rainfall on
the eastern flanks of these mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an orographic effect we're
seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we didn't see these things
before, is that previous fossil sites
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't close enough to the mountains to
actually get enough rainfall to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, oh yeah, rainforests are
truly localized, in fact, to places like
[SPEAKER_00]: volcanoes, which give you localized high
elevation and an orographic increased
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of the model for this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Morley's book, he prints this
really interesting diagram with not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of evidence for it, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of deduced that in the Paleocene,
there might be as many as three bands of
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical rainforest, one equatorial,
one mid-latitude north, one mid-latitude
[SPEAKER_00]: south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was an interesting hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's curious that the Castle Rock site
is pretty much where that northern band is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, that starts to be a
compelling story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the question is, what's the
evidence for that equatorial Paleocene
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the one site in Sarahon in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, that big band in Central Africa,
unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big band in Amazonia, unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are hypotheses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know when the equatorial
rainforest kicks in, primarily because
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of exploration of fossils,
which is the argument for Paleocene
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleontology in general is the good stuff
is all out there still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So further work on the study, as we
started digging into the affinities
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, most of our plants seem to have
Asian affinities, not South American
[SPEAKER_00]: affinities, which makes sense because they
were a peninsula of Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a warm world, you can get stuff across
the Bering land bridge and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, South America is a long ways
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there were these three bands,
you'd have a northern band with Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: affinities, a southern band with
Australasian affinities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows about the equatorial stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bit of evidence we have from the
pollen record suggests that South America
[SPEAKER_00]: has some input from Africa as well in the
Aeolian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just to close this out, my day job now
has imperiled my extensive field work,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is annoying in the extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still continue to do various kinds
of public communication of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a three hour TV show for NOVA
about the making of North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the geology of the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're flying me all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working with Ray Troll,
who's an Alaskan artist, about a book
[SPEAKER_00]: about the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two things, I slip out the door
occasionally and disappear into the wilds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been spending a lot of time
between Seattle and Fairbanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: up the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions I have is like,
this place today is home of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: temperate rainforest of the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from Northern California all the way up
to effectively the latitude of home or
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska, you have temperate, conifer
dominated rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it occurred to me to ask the question,
well, when do those things show up?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you get your first western red
cedars and your dug firs and your Sitka
[SPEAKER_00]: spruces?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do those kick in gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: When is this forest, this is the forest of
my childhood, when does this forest come
[SPEAKER_00]: into being?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've now found three sites that are
pretty interesting in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chukunut, the Kutsunut, the Kanahoo,
and the Chickaloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great names.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these are well studied yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all been known for a long time,
as most fossil sites have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people who collect fossil sites
were collecting the fossils and not
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the site or the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is a landscape which
is full of exotic terrains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are chunks of mini-continents that
hit the crust of North American slide
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards to the slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some northward translation of
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends where you're on the faults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have looked at these three
sites which seem to be in a docked
[SPEAKER_00]: position when they were deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't carrying fossils and docking
after they had fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were docked and the fossils were
buried in those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Chukunut in Washington state,
which is amazing, is it looks like castle
[SPEAKER_00]: rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's palms, there's big leaves with
drip tips, there's huge leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Kutsunahoo, which is – it took me a
long time to figure this out – there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper in 1911 of a USGS geologist who went
to Kupronoff Island, which is east of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitka in southeast Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he publishes just a few general sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Hamilton Bay in near Kupronoff
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in there, there was an illustration of
a cycad and one of the species that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: from Castle Rock in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after much negotiation and figuring out
where Little Hamilton Bay was and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the boat to get to Little Hamilton Bay,
we went to Hamilton Bay in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty cool place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty nondescript bit of coastal
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cruised around the bay and there
was almost no outcrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, where was he digging the
fossils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tide went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 15 feet of tide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the tide went out, you can see slabby
stones right at low tide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ashore and started pulling up
these big slabs of stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was – and one on the left is
actually a Castle Rock species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one I've only seen at Castle Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we dug further, we got into these
really curious cycads with this – really,
[SPEAKER_00]: that triangular apex is actually not an
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found several of that preserved on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just two months ago, I took the NOVA
crew up there and a low tide we popped out
[SPEAKER_00]: a gigantic palm frond at low tide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we dug this out, the tide came up
and washed over the top of that thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: we hauled away this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the silicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seven-foot wide palm frond at
latitude 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say to you, Alaskan palm,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar forest Alaskan palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where are the sitka spruce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, this is a different world
again than we've ever thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in this case, not an orographic
forest, but a coastal forest or a coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: orographic kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wet, warm landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out – we'll be going back to
this spot for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chickaloon, which I thought was
more of a temperate flora – and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you find in museum collections,
the chickaloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the metasequoias, the comptonias
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out there are palms in chickaloon
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this Pacific Northwest Coast
flora that's only known from a few places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's really kind of put the whole
story together yet, but I think there's –
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very curious, what do you want to
call this forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the forest of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tells me that there's an argument
for a lot more field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the warm world of the past is a pretty
compelling way to talk about climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change, I find, because fossils are data,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can show a fossil of a palm in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're redoing the Dinosaur Hall at the
Smithsonian now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I arrived there and immediately closed the
Dinosaur Hall for its first ever
[SPEAKER_00]: renovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will take us several years to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we reopen, there will be this
palm frond from Alaska in the exhibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will just say Alaskan Palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant role in many ways,
because North America is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Ellesmere Island is on the lower
latitude of the island than it was when it
[SPEAKER_00]: had those fossils on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have to do with any fossil
site is do your best to reposition it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was when the fossils were
deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, the continents come together and
close off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When South America gets to North America,
it changes circulation and rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: locally, or creates mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, these exotic cranes come
in and smash into the west side of North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the western part of North
America is created by microconuts slamming
[SPEAKER_00]: into the side of North America and sliding
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a flora, for instance,
in Washington state called the Windsor
[SPEAKER_00]: Flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 115 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like the flora that made that
was deposited in the latitude of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flora was then buried,
fossilized, and that chunk of rock stood
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the position of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Baja PC concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malcolm McKenzie used to call that the
Viking funeral ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key Viking guys would pass
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dead guy floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a dead palm floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of ways that you have to
understand your kind of Elizabethan comics
[SPEAKER_00]: to interpret these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you de-involve that, the story
comes into focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of a tropical plant community
reacting to three, four, five months of
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness at a time is super weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any thoughts about, especially
if it's migrating from an area below the
[SPEAKER_01]: Arctic Circle through the Arctic Circle,
through those extreme variations in
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight hours, are there any thoughts as
to how that's shaping or affecting these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are migrating through that
area?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I showed you is I got
palms as high enough as 61, but 61 is
[SPEAKER_00]: still south of the Arctic Circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flores from Ellesmere appear to be all
deciduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deciduousness seems to be a perfectly
reasonable response in the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we think of deciduousness as a
response to cold winters, but it could
[SPEAKER_00]: just as well be a response to no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no light, why have a leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, there's even an
argument that deciduousness started in no
[SPEAKER_00]: light conditions because it started in the
warm world, we're going to get cold
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might actually have an acceptation
from polar darkness through deciduousness
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pre-adapted for life in a cold
world, which evolves later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the northern extent of tropics,
or for that matter, the southern extent of
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics, remains an interesting question
because we're finding tantalizing clues
[SPEAKER_00]: that both across Beringia and across
Scandinavia and across Antarctica,
[SPEAKER_00]: that some things that are pretty tropical
manage to get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have these time periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one called the Paleocene Ischium
Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: where in an already warm world,
in an already ice-free world, there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: abrupt 6-degree centigrade spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't last very long,
it lasts 100,000 years, but 100,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: is plenty of time for a monkey to walk
from Manchuria to Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that in those moments when
you have the hyperthermal form on these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, when you have hypothermals,
you might be able to squirt
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical-adapted tax across polar land
bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the interesting thing
for me, and we see examples of this both
[SPEAKER_00]: in the north and the south, where things
that are pretty thermophilous have
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives on both sides of land
bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they get there is a pretty good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fully tropical stuff, and once you get
away from, you have to be careful about
[SPEAKER_00]: your terminology because tropics
definitely means between the tropic
[SPEAKER_00]: capricorn and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely abuse the use of that
terminology in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tropics, they describe it as a
plant vegetation or a climate parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so equatorial is probably a better
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really fascinated by this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the reason we haven't
been finding these things everywhere is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need four graphic conditions to
have the heavy rainfall to give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the temperature is there from other
proxies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a matter of targeting your
search image to find more examples of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions about finding forest fires in
phosphor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we certainly find charcoal all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So charcoal has got to be a forest fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually quite abundant,
both macrocharcoal and microcharcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, these charcoal-ified
flowers are one of our evidence of forest
[SPEAKER_00]: fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's been
interesting is that if we predict forest
[SPEAKER_00]: fires in the Q2 boundary, we don't find
the charcoal at the Q2 boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find charcoal throughout the predations
and the pellets, but actually at the Q2
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see charcoal that's predicted by
some of the scenarios we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say there's definitely good
evidence for forest fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a crocodile, a turtle, and a snake
and see where they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't seem to have palms that far
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And palms don't seem to like frozen
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conceivably, things that could
hibernate or be deciduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2012, I went up to the Colbert
River in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Colbert River, there are bone
beds of dinosaurs that are 70 million
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard about this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found two things when I went there
that were kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the bone beds are primarily
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smaller, ductile, but most of them
are small animals about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not migrating animals,
animals that were born locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And died in some sort of probably a big
storm surge in the Beaufort Sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're literally, I dug one third
of a cubic meter of this bone bed and got
[SPEAKER_00]: 260 bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little tiny baby dinosaur bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bone bed went for miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there are volcanic ash deposits
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volcanic ash is a really great thing for
fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about volcanoes,
they erupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ash rains out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically like raining that out
of rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bury landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get Pompeii-like situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pompeii is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the best fossil site in the world,
I would argue, is this ash fall on
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the middle of nowhere in Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about an 11 million year old ash fall
from an eruption that happened in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bury a herd of rhinos in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are baby rhinos next to the mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything is exactly as it
happened 11 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 1990, Scott Williams of
Smithsonian found an ash fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: buried, pretentious meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the ash buried an herbaceous,
pretentious landscape with all the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in growth position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually see for the first
time what the herbaceous vegetation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pretentious looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was up in the Coldwell River,
there were these ash beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just picked one up at the bottom of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just covered in ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this world up there in the
pretentious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other point about the
hierarchical warm situation is that
[SPEAKER_00]: because we talked, there was a lot of
discussion about the pittance easing
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the warmth, there was a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high warmth was sporadic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always forested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my mind, that ion, an arctic,
forest biome of the ESK is a really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: place to study because of those issues of
winter, darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to get cold, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But people have modeled methane clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've modeled warm currents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've modeled variety of ways to keep it
from getting frigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to get cold, but it can't get
frigid.
[SPEAKER_01]: No further questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank Kurt for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
