[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a little uneasy because,
as Kevin mentioned, I am a very broad,
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly trained macroecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think I'm a conservation
biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not a plant scientist,
so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some information may be spotty in terms of
maybe what is the core interest for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put my presentation in perspective,
it's all about new ways to study or
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate an old question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are species distributed or found where
they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start with an inspiring quote
that pushes biologists, or at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985, E.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson was pushing biologists to take on
this grand challenge of trying to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to learn more about diversity
in general worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the words of E.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson, this is a mission worth all our
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 1985, not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 2010, another great entomologist
came back to tell us that it is critical,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very important to try to study
diversity on our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe what we need is a grand approach,
the type of approach and the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: funding and resources that NASA has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago, 15 years after E.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson called all scientists to study
diversity and focus on that, 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: later the message was very similar or even
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another message that is related to trying
to understand, trying to study diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically provide a justification for
this effort is from the world of ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: science and valuation of ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is we do want to know as
much as we can about species and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth investing our time because our
understanding of species distribution and
[SPEAKER_00]: function and ecosystems actually,
in the end, overall affect human life
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, put a spin to our type of
research that makes the public more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested and more aware of why we study
diversity patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a very brief schematic
view of what I do and then a cloud of
[SPEAKER_00]: words that are more common or abundant in
my publication so far, I am, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly speaking, interested in species
distributions and factors that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: species distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use several ways of addressing questions
that are related to species distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our understanding of species
distributions does branch out into many
[SPEAKER_00]: different fields and I am just naming a
few here, conservation biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeography and disease ecology,
the more recent ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do today is give you an
idea of the kind of work that I do and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe spark some interest in your using
some of these methods for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plan is to go down spatial scale from
broad scale questions to maybe regional
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to fine scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that I have one here,
the last, the finest scale question in
[SPEAKER_00]: gray area, gray font and that is because
we are just starting to work more at this
[SPEAKER_00]: level on this scale and we have more
questions and more data to collect and
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then actually giving you answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in order to address questions at
these various scales, questions related to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and factors that affect
species distributions, I'm using two main
[SPEAKER_00]: types of research techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is ecological niche modeling and the
other one is remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you very brief overviews on the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go down the scale to see these
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plant examples, as I said,
they may not be very dense and informative
[SPEAKER_00]: from a biological standpoint, but
hopefully you can help me fill in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blanks in those areas.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecological niche modeling or E&M is a very
active field of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I wanted to do first is start
with just an understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology because we know that niche can
mean various things to various people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the history of ecology, you may be
aware of definitions of niche provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinnell in the early 1900s, Elton in the
1930s, and then Hutchinson in the 1950s
[SPEAKER_00]: and 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make sense of all these
definitions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to me, it makes sense and to other
people, it makes sense to think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that organisms have on
environments, on the environments that
[SPEAKER_00]: they occupy versus the responses that
organisms have to the environments and the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of requirements that organisms have,
how they choose environments in which they
[SPEAKER_00]: live and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if we think about the niche from
this effects versus responses or impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: of species on the environments versus
requirements, environmental requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: of species, maybe it's a little easier to
make sense of these definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then trying to put the niche
concepts on a geographic scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can think of questions that are
addressed at small scale, geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: extents versus large geographic extents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this sliding scale, going back to
impacts versus requirements, think about
[SPEAKER_00]: at the small geographic extent,
when we talk about species impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we are talking about is the
functional role of species in that small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for these kinds of questions,
we usually use mechanistic models that try
[SPEAKER_00]: to quantify the dynamic relationships
between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of consumer resource dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are very different models than
what I do, which is at larger extents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ecological niche modeling is more
useful at these larger extents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should point over here, where the
interest is in the requirements that
[SPEAKER_00]: species have in order to survive in a
certain region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that summarizes the geographic niche or
the abiotic niche of a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we use empirical models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you one type of models that
we use in this broad umbrella of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological niche modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big assumption here is that the
requirements, the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of the species are stronger
than the interactions, the biotic
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the abiotic interactions are
more important than biotic interactions in
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping the distribution of species at
these larger scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about, if we are into the
ecological niche modeling field,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we go about measuring, estimating,
quantifying this abiotic or Grinnellian
[SPEAKER_00]: niche, as it is known in the literature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are three methods that I am
aware of, or three possible approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be physiological experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go in the lab, and we test the
limits that a species has, an organism
[SPEAKER_00]: has, to, let's say, varying temperature,
if it's an aquatic species varying
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go into the lab, and we find out
what are the physiological boundaries of
[SPEAKER_00]: the species, which can then possibly be
measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really hard work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we are interested in mapping the
biodiversity of a little study,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a study that has not been, of a country
that has not been studied very well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do not have time to develop
physiological models for many different
[SPEAKER_00]: species for which we don't have
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a slightly, maybe, mad scientist
scenario would be to introduce species in
[SPEAKER_00]: various types of environments and figure
out which kinds of environments sustain,
[SPEAKER_00]: allow that species to survive in long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously impractical,
a large scale, probably unethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to change ecosystems by
doing these kinds of large scale studies
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third method that is widely used in
ecological niche modeling world is has to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with making use of information we have
available about where species are and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions that are present
at those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we build correlation type models,
simply put, that quantify that
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between where species are and
what kind of environments are present at
[SPEAKER_00]: those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you more visual on these
correlation approaches to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental requirements, we start with
species records.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be museum specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be surveys, any type of
occurrence data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, we use various
digitized maps of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm showing you just some examples
here, annual precipitation, annual
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, seasonality of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these form our calibration data
or training data, which we use to build a
[SPEAKER_00]: model, estimate the niche of that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a plethora of algorithms and
approaches to making sense, quantifying
[SPEAKER_00]: this relationship between organism,
presence, and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm naming just a few here, and I'll
briefly show Maxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, oops, sorry, jumped one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have that, once we have the
model calibrated with these occurrences
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental data, what we do is we
then project this model back onto
[SPEAKER_00]: geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take data out of the geographic
context, the spatial context.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this environmental context,
we build a model, we calibrate the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we take that model back into
geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: We project that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get back to why this is
important, this model projection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we get is an estimation of
suitability across a landscape for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular species of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to move a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one of the widely used algorithms
is Maxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper that promoted the use of Maxen
or described this algorithm was published
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been cited over 3,000 times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a widely used methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do here is basically contrast
known presences with the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some occurrences, we have some
knowledge of where a species is present on
[SPEAKER_00]: a landscape, and we contrast the
conditions at presences with the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions across the rest of the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one way of quantifying
suitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a probability of suitability more
likely if the conditions are similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: presences and less likely if the
conditions are similar to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's contrasting presence and the rest
of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so jumping to the first example of the
use of ecological niche modeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this at the largest scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that we actually varied the
scale of the question for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was, can we create reliable
species richness estimates when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with various geographic extents or
the scale of our analysis varies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an area of intense research
because we use these estimated species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness maps to create, for example,
hot spots for conservation or for future
[SPEAKER_00]: climate effects, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing how well we estimate species
richness with ecological niche modeling is
[SPEAKER_00]: of importance for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the question is, do we get various
estimates in terms of quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: various species richness estimates from
ecological niche modeling when the scale
[SPEAKER_00]: varies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the question that we tried to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ Harris is not a PhD candidate anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: She successfully defended about two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's moving on to a postdoc at the
Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she was the main driver of this
particular study and then her advisor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mike Palmer, both from the botany
department at Oklahoma State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are working the manuscript is in
review, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have positive criticism and useful
reviews back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what was the idea here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was to compare, correlate
observed species richness with estimated
[SPEAKER_00]: species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the observed species richness,
these data come from floras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the estimated species richness,
the data come from stacked models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we build basically, sorry, I'll talk
about the models later.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what is the observed species
richness?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we consider the standard in
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a large amount of data from
various floras that, a lot of data came
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Floras of North America project,
but also from checklists and very small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale floras across North America,
we, well, AJ mostly, AJ amassed a data set
[SPEAKER_00]: of Cactaceae and Pinaceae species in North
America, north of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excluding Mexico, we didn't have data
for Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see are at the county level,
but the floras had different scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the county level, you see the
species richness, the number of species in
[SPEAKER_00]: these two families that we decided to
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then based on the information that
we had about the floras, we created six
[SPEAKER_00]: classes of extents or floras that were
generated at six different extents,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting from 10 hectare, between 10
hectare and 100 hectares, all the way to a
[SPEAKER_00]: million to 10 million hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to have a very well-balanced
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We split the flora information in the
three regions, Arctic, Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had, in each scale class,
we had the same number of floras that we
[SPEAKER_00]: considered for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then for the estimated species
richness, we applied ecological niche
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling, species by species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We build models.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Cactaceae and Pinaceae,
with the same occurrence data,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental data approach, max-end
ecological niche modeling algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created these predicted
distributions for each species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then we stacked for each flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what did we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, and I forgot to mention we had
24 species of Cactaceae and 51 species of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the data for the ecological niche
modeling part of this project came from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility, which is a distributed database
[SPEAKER_00]: of museum records and observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had, as environmental data or
variables, we had climatic data and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: data for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we generate these stacked models to
estimate the number of species in each
[SPEAKER_00]: flora we considered at these six different
scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we put the two together,
and we try to see how well they correlate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, starting with Cactaceae, what we see
is that if we pull all extents,
[SPEAKER_00]: those six or eight different extents we
have, if we pull them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a good correlation, I would say,
0.68, deviation from the slope of one
[SPEAKER_00]: quite big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an OK correlation, not a very strong
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So correlation between observed species
richness through flora and estimated
[SPEAKER_00]: species richness through this stacking of
ecological niche models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we start separating by extents of
floras, what we see is at the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, that 1 to 10 million hectares,
we have a high correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the largest extent, this seems to be
a useful approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the other end of the spectrum,
at the finest extent, abysmal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not use ecological niche modeling
and the stacked approach to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: species richness because it's not really
doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Pinaceae, the situation is not good
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at all extents, definitely not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the largest extent, somewhat working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlation is 0.56 some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat OK, but not a great approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deviation from the slope is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the smallest extent,
as you expected, do not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not estimate species richness with
the stacked ecological niche modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one way of informing this
ecological niche modeling field of the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicability of this approach to
estimating species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, what I want to do is go into a
slightly smaller scale and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic niche dissimilarity for one plant
species that has two morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here was, do we see a
climatic difference between populations
[SPEAKER_00]: that have different morphologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study is a collaboration with
botanists, again, botanists from Jeanette
[SPEAKER_00]: Steedts from OSU, then Diana and Naoki
from University of Alaska Fairbanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then geologists from OSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here is not me,
but Jeanette examined two morphs of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis camchatka, and she used the
herbarium specimens available at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two morphs that she looked at and
that are common in camchatka populations
[SPEAKER_00]: are the trichome bearing leaves versus
glabrous leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smooth versus leaves that have these
unicellular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was able to find 116 specimens for
the trichome bearing morph and 200 and 330
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens for the glabrous morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a map of the distribution of
these specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: She georeferenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: She and Jeff georeferenced many of these
occurrences.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what did we do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the records for the two morphs,
environmental data, again, and we built
[SPEAKER_00]: two models, two different models for the
trichome bearing specimens based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome bearing specimens and the
glabrous specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is, first look at these
maps, is the trichome bearing has a
[SPEAKER_00]: narrower distribution than the glabrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coastal maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coastal maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more coastal and this is more
inland species, a wider distribution based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the occurrences and also based on our
estimated suitability for the glabrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we have a visual of the climatic
suitability for the two morphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we want to quantify how different,
are they really different, these two
[SPEAKER_00]: suitability envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we used background
similarity tests, which allow us to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: if the two morphs are ecologically more
similar or less similar than expected by
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we created 100 replicates
of these models where we randomized one
[SPEAKER_00]: data set for one morph and created models
and then randomized the other data set for
[SPEAKER_00]: the other morph and created models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have real models based on
real data comparing that with random
[SPEAKER_00]: models based on randomizing, taking at
random occurrences, not occurrences,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking at random locations that are not
presences for that particular morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used two statistics,
Schoeners and I statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they basically do is they look at the
probability of suitability for one morph
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the probability of suitability
for the other morph at each location in
[SPEAKER_00]: geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do slightly different things,
but overall, they should provide a unified
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get different answers from these two
different metrics, it means that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is quantifying the
suitability probability for each pixel and
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing between the two morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we get is that this is the
distribution of random models,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is where our observed overall
niche overlap or similarity between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two morphs is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is number of replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we have just one for the real
models, and then we have a number of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: each for the random models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that there is a
statistical significant distinction that
[SPEAKER_00]: two morphs are less similar than expected
by chance based on this statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same for this other statistic,
and we obtained similar results where the
[SPEAKER_00]: niche dissimilarity between the two morphs
was statistically significant compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: a null distribution of these values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are saying is the two morphs
are climatically dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other way to look at this is which
variables contribute most to the two
[SPEAKER_00]: models, the two real models for the
morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a list of the variables that
we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that in bold,
we have variables that cumulatively amount
[SPEAKER_00]: to 70% or more contribution to the model
gain for that particular morph,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that the variables in bold have
the highest contribution, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important contribution to a good model fit
for that morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is that there is a
discrepancy between glabrous morph,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has in that highest contribution
mean-dural temperature range and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, but not the trichome
bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going down here, we have annual
precipitation and precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality for the other morph,
the trichome bearing morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tells us that one morph is more
sensitive, at least from this modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, one morph is more sensitive
to temperature variation and the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: to precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And elevation and minimum temperature of
the coldest month was in common between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two morphs.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I would like to talk a little bit
about discrimination of trees and then
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going down this scale, moving to finer
and finer scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to these questions, now we are
switching to approaches that are based on
[SPEAKER_00]: remote sensing, a very, very big field in
engineering and geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are making use of it just a tiny
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential to develop this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get everyone on board,
we have some sort of sensor, can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: satellite or can be on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what the sensor is recording is
the amount of light that is reflected off
[SPEAKER_00]: different surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic of remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for us, it's important because it
allows us to get data from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we don't get on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is accessible data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's collected by a satellite and it's
free like Landsat, we have access to that
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a greater temporal resolution
because the satellite keeps orbiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a really good temporal
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have this potential in
extracting biodiversity data that is of
[SPEAKER_00]: use to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you some ideas,
we detect type of surface with remote
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the amount of light reflected,
we have two different types of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's think of man-made surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of light that is reflected
is basically what gets used in these land
[SPEAKER_00]: cover classification if you look at the
land cover map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very important is the amount of light
that is absorbed or reflected by different
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments in the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where remote sensing becomes
extremely important for us biologists who
[SPEAKER_00]: are interested in plant function,
plant structure, plant distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the important aspect of remote
sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one other important aspect of remote
sensing is that there is a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors collecting this information,
this light amount of light that is
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected off various surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a multispectral sensor splits the
wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: in a few distinct bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of Landsat, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few distinct bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information, the sensor can only
process information, amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected from this one particular band,
for example, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's multispectral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hyperspectral refers to splitting
this electromagnetic spectrum in very
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow bands, 10 nanometer bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get hundreds of bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sensors provide data sources that
are rich in information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way of using this is to try to look
at particular reflectance of different
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, and in this case, trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here the question is, can we pick out
emergent trees, big, large canopy trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that are standing above smaller trees,
can we pick them out spectrally from one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these hyperspectral high density of
reflectance bands?
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done in collaboration with
excellent botanists from Peru and a field
[SPEAKER_00]: assistant whose name I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a long time ago when I was
finishing my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are botanists in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Greg Asner is a scientist at Carnegie
Institution for Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I have my botanist collaborators
in field mode, I have pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have them in more official
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to go with field mode for
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg Asner, then my former PhD advisor
and my collaborator from World Wildlife
[SPEAKER_00]: Fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, like I said, work that was
finished as I was finishing graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been published some time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study site was somewhere in
southeastern Peru, beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also highly diverse area in terms of tree
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the interest was a subset,
a very small subset of these tree species
[SPEAKER_00]: that are used by various animal species as
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frugivorous animals that need fruit
produced by these trees and actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality, which I will briefly mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the species of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Fabace species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot the family for the Brazilian
knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have four taxa from Fabace and then
the Brazilian knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a map of showing location,
various points for these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to notice is low sample sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are hard areas to work because they
are so diverse, the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can walk and walk and walk and not
find a second emergent Apulea tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sample sizes are less than ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had satellite images.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hyperspectral, high bend density
images from four different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that precipitation-wise,
we had dry season, more rain, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: wettest part of the season, of the year,
and then another from the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had both more dry and then one image
from the wet season, which was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was quite happy to get that one
because of the cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get images for these
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the hyperspectral image is
exciting, but then the processing is
[SPEAKER_00]: really convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say that from that great
242-band data set, we were down to 126
[SPEAKER_00]: that we used because of various reasons,
cloud atmospheric problems, poor
[SPEAKER_00]: signal-to-noise ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made us reduce that initial data set by
half, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did various things to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into it, but just
wanted to mention this 126 bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a view of how this Hyperion
hyperspectral imagery maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a crown here that is almost an
entire pixel, 30 by 30 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that is almost 30 by 30
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a tree here that is not a
full pixel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is split between four different pixels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were focusing on these pixels that
represented more than 40% of the crown of
[SPEAKER_00]: a single tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a spectral profile with
the bands removed, the remaining 126
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow bands that we kept in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a linear discriminant function
analysis of these 126 bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We initially did a stepwise selection
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used only the most informative of
these 126.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got really good classification
errors, meaning really low classification
[SPEAKER_00]: errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see is for one tree species
that we couldn't identify to the species
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this one taxon, we have classification
errors, meaning that the linear
[SPEAKER_00]: discriminant function analysis was not
able to spectrally identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also had only four individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pushing the limits of this
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the Brazilian tree knot,
we had in one of the time frames,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember we had four different images,
we had error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show you the two profiles for
the various individuals, we do see
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in these spectral curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see temporal variation within a
taxon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Apulea in July and in December,
different spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that difference was quantified with a
canonical analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is that based on the season
that these images are collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectra group in various parts of the
canonical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is we don't have a
spectrum signature that is species
[SPEAKER_00]: specific at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use that spectral signature to
identify a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is season based.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, lastly, the habitat structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very fast because I
don't have a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just started to work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with my PhD student,
Cassandra, who took on this challenge of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to use LIDAR, terrestrial
LIDAR, to quantify vegetation architecture
[SPEAKER_00]: for one particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bird species that she's interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the bird species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general view of the shrubland
grassland ecotone in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what she's trying to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LIDAR, or light detection and ranging,
what it does is it sends pulses out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then measures the time it takes for the
pulse to reach the sensor again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that, if we think of a LIDAR
that goes or laser beam that goes from
[SPEAKER_00]: above, this particular structure will have
this form where there is more returns when
[SPEAKER_00]: it hits part of the tree and less returns
when it goes through between two trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can do this from above,
but we can do also this from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where our interest lies for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do this terrestrial scanning of
bushes and quantify vegetation structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the variables that
we hope to take out of these clouds of
[SPEAKER_00]: points that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mean shrub height, shrub volume,
foliage profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: On this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is distance from the scanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much time it takes for the
beam to get back, the pulse to get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is converted to distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have any answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we've been doing this summer,
collecting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult logistics we can talk about
later if you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are doing is we are scanning
one way and then scanning another way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a full 360 view of the vegetation from
this point all the way 500 meters
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we get are, for now, pretty
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a point cloud where vegetation is
classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get rid of soil or any other
atmospherics, anything that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a profile of one of the study
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another pretty image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, no quantitative information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this shows vegetation height
classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lightest green is the highest
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the darkest or the brown pixels are
the shortest vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get vegetation height for now
from these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I tried to do was show you an
example at large scale of ecological niche
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling of estimating species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that, at least for the
two families we studied, fine scale do not
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large scale Cactaceae works better than
Pinaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then moving on to a more regional scale,
we compared the morphology of one species,
[SPEAKER_00]: two different morphs, and the potential
adaptation to different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we showed was that we have two
morphs that are, statistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are climatically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, we were able to identify
trees based on spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is seasonal variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot use one spectral profile to
just go there and map species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be season specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then habitat, we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still in the process of gathering
data and making sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, what I want to close with
is say that these types of approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological niche modeling, for example,
allows us to basically extend the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of information we can gather from
occurrence data and environmental data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows us to learn a bit more about
ecological requirements, climatic
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for a particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope that this improves our
understanding of species distributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: why species are where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at fine scale with these remote
sensing approaches, what we are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at is more of the species function
locally and interactions in more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat plant animal interaction type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
