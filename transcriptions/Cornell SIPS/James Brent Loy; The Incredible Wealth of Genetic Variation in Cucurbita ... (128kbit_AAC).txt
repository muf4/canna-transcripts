[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very honored to be able to come here
and be able to interact with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grad students who went out to dinner and
had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably ordered the wrong stuff,
some hot food, but that was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a fair amount of
connection with Cornell people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think particularly those of you that are
graduate students ought to realize how
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunate you are to be able to work at an
institution which has a lot of depth in
[SPEAKER_01]: the different areas of plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are your mentors,
they're well-known people all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my interactions, throughout my career,
I've met so many people and I find,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my gosh, he's from Cornell,
she's from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell has a reputation for graduating a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize there's a lot of molecular work
and bigger focus on the molecular end of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but what I've noticed over my
career is that a lot of the people I've
[SPEAKER_01]: interacted with have good basic knowledge,
but they're also able to reach out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I do a lot of very applied
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of interaction with vegetable
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a number of people from
Cornell that I've seen over the years
[SPEAKER_01]: interact well and give a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take the basic information and bring
it down to the growers level.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will always continue to be important,
regardless of the balance of research
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The information in agriculture at some
point has to get to the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some institutions lose sight of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been several people from Cornell
that have given me some assistance through
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molly John, Henry Munger, passed away some
years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Zitter, pathologist, has helped me out
in sending me cultures and diagnosing
[SPEAKER_01]: certain disease problems that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also met a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work in agriculture plastics a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out probably because of the
particular expertise at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University, a lot of those people were
trained at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's a real honor to be able to
speak to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita, I do melon breeding,
but I'm not going to talk about that at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita is an extremely interesting
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the species originated in America,
in North and South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them at an extremely early date.
[SPEAKER_01]: To start off with, C.
[SPEAKER_01]: maxima on the bottom originated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the wild species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the progenitor of C.
[SPEAKER_01]: maxima.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is the distribution
of this particular species by the time the
[SPEAKER_01]: Europeans colonized the Americas,
the distribution was probably about like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't up in the United States or
Central America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of archaeological
sites where they've recovered maxima.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back maybe three or four or five
thousand years ago, the domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the younger species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fissifolia, I'm not going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows at high altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not intercross with any of the
other domesticated species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has very little variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost monotypic, but it's adapted to
very high elevations and has not found a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of worldwide use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita machata, that's the one species
that's most adapted to the tropics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably affected how it was
distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally thought to have
originated in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were archaeological dates
for its existence going back like 6,000
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, but now they have samples that
they've been able to get from sites in
[SPEAKER_01]: this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go back about 10,000, nine to 10,000
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually in these archaeological
sites, the material that's preserved are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and fruits, pieces of fruit rind,
but it's usually the seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: characterize the particular variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have the stem of the fruit,
the peduncle of the fruit, we can also
[SPEAKER_01]: characterize the varieties that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is thought that it originated here
because there's a lot of variation and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of very relic varieties that exist in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about a gyrusperma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly used for its seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been utilized much throughout
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita pepo people, subspecies people
originated in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it goes back at least 9,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been several archaeological sites
where they found this particular species.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another subspecies of people,
ovifera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite interesting that these two
species, the wild species from which the
[SPEAKER_01]: ovifera came, exists down in this area and
up into this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the wild progenitor of this
particular species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Native Americans introduced and bred
this species going back about 5,000 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It spread throughout the eastern half of
the U.S., not so much over in the western
[SPEAKER_01]: half of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this species originated and
there's archaeological sites down in
[SPEAKER_01]: southern Mexico and also along in this
area, the state of Tamalipas in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most interesting thing is even though
these species are easily crossable,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could almost consider them one
species, but there was no contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any knowledge of contact
prior to the Europeans coming that these
[SPEAKER_01]: species ever crossed with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unusual to find two species that
were domesticated so close to one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there apparently was not a lot of
human contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a lot of inter-crossing of
these particular species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variation of this species is well
documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to more talk about the variation
that relates to my breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can go back into herbals back into
the 16th century and see quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation in the species because the
Europeans, when they came over and
[SPEAKER_01]: conquered some of the countries,
they brought back the fruit to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duchenne's drawings in 1786, Natural
History of the Gourds, shows about all the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes that exist today in Cucurbita
people, subspecies of Vifra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the vegetable garden is kind of
interesting to look at because it shows
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of the variation in cucurbits
and other vegetables existing in the 19th
[SPEAKER_01]: century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the cucurbits, vegetables in New
York, there's a whole series of vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York that was published back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have copies of several of the vegetables
and they're just fun to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole lot of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Complete Squash by Amy Goldman is
probably one of the best of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what was in my greenhouse three
weeks ago that came from the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just have to tell you that all the
variation that you see in all those
[SPEAKER_01]: catalogs of stuff, a good share of it
exists in this particular photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with all three species and the two
subspecies and it's almost overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very daunting task for me at this
stage in my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: These all involve selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do cooking tests and various
evaluations on all these squash in these
[SPEAKER_01]: two pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita maxima, just to refresh your
interest or refresh your knowledge of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the main cucurbita maxima that you see in
supermarkets is kabocha or buttercup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We generally call a squash buttercup if it
has a protruding ovary, whereas in Asian
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, they've gotten rid of that and
it's called kabocha squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a general term in Asia for any
small squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The processing golden delicious is the
main processing squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few hybrids, but mostly just
open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, in Argentina, you have summer
squash produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let it grow a little bigger than our
summer squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get big enough, but they do
use it as a summer squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several others that I can't show,
but the giant show pumpkin are really an
[SPEAKER_01]: anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size is just unbelievable in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we go to cucurbita people,
subspecies ovifera, the acorn group,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though you probably don't think of
this as an acorn, this is a delicata type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sweet and dumpling type,
but it's all called the acorn group.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some books, the straightnecks and the
crooknecks, summer squash and the scallops
[SPEAKER_01]: are all put into separate groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them all summer squash,
the squash that's eaten immature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for some reason in New England and
the Northeast, the zucchini is a zucchini
[SPEAKER_01]: and the summer squash is a yellow squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all summer squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all eaten immature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then gourds, I define gourds as squash
having a hard shell and having some
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not always the definition getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's what I mean about cucurbita
people, subspecies people, the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: originated in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one thing, the size is bigger and you
have some that are quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have quite a lot of variation in
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of my breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw in a store window when we were
eating last night, I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked just like this matter of fact,
but it was all fake pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was plastic pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of discouraging actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the summer squash arena,
this is probably the dominant use of
[SPEAKER_01]: squash is for summer squash, particularly
the zucchini types.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were derived from the cocazell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all from Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These types were bred actually in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as we know, they were not bred in
the area of origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbita machata, I didn't start working
with cucurbita machata until just really
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 12 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seed companies come to me in the
80s, particularly Libby's was breeding a
[SPEAKER_01]: processing, this Dickinson field
processing type.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me some lines to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at them, they're really,
really poor quality for edibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, well, I'm not going to work on
cucurbita machata.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's butternuts and it's this
Dickinson field type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed companies, they can do all the
work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get involved with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now it's my biggest breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I'm so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into third world countries,
because we have adapted some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties so they grow in temperate
climates and some of these, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: calabiza that exists down in the Caribbean
and there's a lot of varieties of machata
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to India and all the squash in
the market, I don't have a picture of one
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but later on, there's the large
cheese type you see them in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the type of quality we would think for
like a butternut, but nonetheless,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very popular in Asian countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit of squash is a people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, it's a modified berry and the
flesh actually is derived both from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ovary and it's also derived from the
floral cup or the receptacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes it interesting because
occasionally you get a selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be two colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a real intense color in the
ovary part and also in the placental
[SPEAKER_01]: material and then this outer ring of flesh
will be totally a different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find a good slide of that to
show you because you could have gene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression for carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have different expression in the
receptacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The receptacle tissue versus the ovary
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a monaceous flowering species,
bee pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bumble bees are the most efficient
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a cucurbit bee that actually
evolved with squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to have open soil in order to
nest and so we don't have very many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: squash bees at the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not quite as efficient as bumble
bees and also honey bees will pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into the intricate
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is it's monaceous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Separate male and female flowers and they
flower in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make a beautiful ornamental plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have flowers that are that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cucurbit people, we have some that are
foot in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful flowers but they wilt during the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that sense, you couldn't bring them in
a house and use them as an ornamental.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just shows the different species and
they have slightly different flower
[SPEAKER_01]: structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with them, you can kind of
see that this is kind of a bell shaped and
[SPEAKER_01]: this has the very deep lobes in it and the
machata is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a breeding standpoint, what one needs
to know is these flowers wilt down at
[SPEAKER_01]: different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's genetically endowed in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cucurbit people, it often wilts down
by nine in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: By wilts down, I mean the flower loses its
turgor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it loses its turgor in the male
flower, the pollen loses its ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: germinate on the stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pollinate in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that the subspecies ovifera
is the first to wilt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to pollinate it by eight or eight
thirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we move over to this field and it's
got the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can pollinate it depending on how
cloudy or sunny it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can pollinate it late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the machata is we pollinate between
nine thirty and ten thirty and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: move over to the maximus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way with a small crew that
we can deal with all these species and get
[SPEAKER_01]: our work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go in the day before and we tie
these flowers off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell when they're going to flower
the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible you can take a female
flower that's at this stage and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate it and it will set fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have a little bit of leeway You can
also the male pollen even before it's shed
[SPEAKER_01]: can fertilize but it's kind of difficult
to get the pollen out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally we like to have that flower open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the growth curve and this
happens to be a seed pumpkin example which
[SPEAKER_01]: is a little bit extreme because most of
the energy is going into the seeds rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than in the flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumpkins and squash behave like any
crop that produces a storage organ like
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words the vegetative growth peaks
usually shortly after flowering and then
[SPEAKER_01]: as the leaves senesce it goes downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have in the paracarp and the
flesh of the pumpkin you have the biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: is mainly going into the flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peak dry matter of the flesh occurs
earlier than it does with the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What actually happens is if you get too
much plants in essence the seed is still
[SPEAKER_01]: developing in that fruit and it actually
takes away starch reserves from the flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to know because if you pick
your fruit too early in development then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're interested in the flesh not the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have respiration occurring
and you're also going to have transport of
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars from the flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starch break down and transport into the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to have the knowledge of
the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more detailed work that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I graduated back in the late 90s and
actually looked at embryo growth because
[SPEAKER_01]: no one had looked at embryo growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have had a picture of a fruit cut
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cut open a fruit 20 days after
fruit set or after pollination if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at that fruit you'll say oh the seeds are
fully developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is the seed coat is fully
developed not fully developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reaches its full size and the seed size
you don't see segregation for seed size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a maternal trait and it's determined
by the seed coat which is maternal tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why all the seeds even if you have
segregation for seed size you don't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: until the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if you opened up that seed at
20 days I should have put in a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: that but the embryo is very small only a
couple of millimeters big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The embryo reaches near full size in the
next 20 days but it actually accumulates
[SPEAKER_01]: lipids and proteins up to 55 to 60 days
and so it's important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual fruit growth if you look at the
fruit growth curves depends on the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a small board actually the fruit
reaches maximum size in about 12 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the acorn squash 15 to 18 days and
in like a pumpkin at 25 days a 25 pound
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin will reach its full size in about
25 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about the show pumpkins
and the only reason I know this is I've
[SPEAKER_01]: given talks to these growers they're
fanatics about growing these big pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retired farmers that's what they do they
grow their show pumpkins and so one had a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice growth curve of a show pumpkin he
measured circumference over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really amazed these show pumpkins
are still growing in growth at 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing quite a different
curve from this curve and again the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesocarp dry weight the starch content
peaks really close to 30 days 35 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it generally usually goes down again
this is with a seed pumpkin and so again
[SPEAKER_01]: in the case of the seed pumpkin it needs
mesocarp it needs to get sugars from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesocarp so the mesocarp goes down a
little in order to feed the embryo growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I talk about pumpkins to growers
this is just a chart I would show pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: growers because it's a little different in
a pumpkin all you need is an orange
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin right and so that color change
usually occurs between 25 and 40 days
[SPEAKER_01]: after pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some varieties a little later but
most most varieties some of them reach
[SPEAKER_01]: full color by maybe 32 days after
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well can you harvest the grower always ask
well can I harvest my pumpkins right after
[SPEAKER_01]: they turn orange I said yeah go ahead you
know and if you have a healthy plant the
[SPEAKER_01]: the peduncle will be fine the stem of the
of the pumpkin that's in breeding pumpkins
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the most important part if you
don't have a good stem if you can't carry
[SPEAKER_01]: a pumpkin out of the field on its stem
it's not good and so it turns out that
[SPEAKER_01]: cellulose and lignin most of that is the
accumulated in the peduncle most of it by
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 days and there's a difference in
varieties on that and so and again it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's we actually did a study of peduncle
dry matter and dry weight in pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to know that okay in
order to know when to harvest it but of
[SPEAKER_01]: course the seeds not mature by then so in
my work my timeline for my cucurbit
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects at UNH my first I was
breeding melons all since I started I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't talk about melons but it but I
started off I was only breeding working
[SPEAKER_01]: with cucurbit of maxima for a number of
years and I'll be honest with you my first
[SPEAKER_01]: variety in maxima came out in 1981 well
that's 13 years of breeding to produce my
[SPEAKER_01]: first variety that doesn't say too much
maybe about my breeding expertise is it
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult project I was trying to put
bush genes into a large fruited processing
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin because there was a huge
processing industry in New England and the
[SPEAKER_01]: northeast at the time in the golden
delicious type and I had a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal type of pumpkin that I envisioned a
more upright bush pumpkin would be a more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient photosynthetically and and we
did a lot of background work you know
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing the the phenotype of bush and
the leaf area and light intercepts and and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth I'm not going to go into that but
it was a pretty difficult project well in
[SPEAKER_01]: in in the lines you see that are in in
dark these are the projects where I've
[SPEAKER_01]: spent the most research time on but
they're not the projects that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint of getting something into the
industry were successful and that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how it is at institution you work
on some projects that seed companies
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't necessarily work on but maybe
those will never be successful at getting
[SPEAKER_01]: something into the seed industry so with
me because I like to breed an end product
[SPEAKER_01]: I I tried to have enough projects so I
could introduce varieties into the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: market you know so the growers would think
I was actually doing something at UNH you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you're a breeder and you're there
for 13 years and you don't have much to
[SPEAKER_01]: show for it and you go to a grower meeting
you're giving a talk is shaking their
[SPEAKER_01]: heads you know what the hell's Lloyd doing
you know I mean that's always bothered me
[SPEAKER_01]: and it so what happened to the to this
bush strain well Agway tried to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: it and so forth well the processing
companies they're kind of they're back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 19th century you know in terms of how
they space things and so they were used to
[SPEAKER_01]: growing processing pumpkins 12 by 12 and
and that was their cultivation system
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter what we told them I could
tell them look you need high density
[SPEAKER_01]: planting you need to plant this bush
strain you know close spacing and give
[SPEAKER_01]: them a spacing but you go out in their
fields it was 12 by 12 and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me well it doesn't yield well no a
bush plant it's it's three to four feet in
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter at 12 foot spacing is not going
to give a very good yield is it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so so what happened in New England by the
time I got my first variety the processing
[SPEAKER_01]: industry was gone I mean just gone left by
the by the completely by the mid 1985 well
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue these lines processing lines I
had them and turns out now that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: actually using some of those processing
lines for breeding root stocks for melon
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so so I'm glad I kind of hung on to
those but and the same thing I use the
[SPEAKER_01]: bush the bush genes that I've accumulated
because it's it's not just one bush gene
[SPEAKER_01]: as you've seen the literature actually
maximum others we've identified three bush
[SPEAKER_01]: genes and so and they're all in completely
dominant so difficult to work with and so
[SPEAKER_01]: we we have developed a number of bush
lines high quality again all our material
[SPEAKER_01]: was a very low quality you know and in
terms of starch content and the genes for
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing starch content it's a
quantitative trait somewhat difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollis pumpkins I started to work and was
doing a lot of work on you know well
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the composition of the hall and
this and that and and had a fair number of
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate students work on Hollis seeded
pumpkin well it's not a it's not an easy
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to get going in the US North
America all a lot of the snack food
[SPEAKER_01]: companies trail mix companies say they
would like North America they'd like seed
[SPEAKER_01]: available from North America they relied
on China okay there was a down year in
[SPEAKER_01]: China two years ago they didn't produce
enough seed so all these trail mix
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are crying we're crying for seed
and they're all saying well we want some
[SPEAKER_01]: North America growers but what they don't
want and not they're not willing to have
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts you can't ask a grower to come
up with a million dollars for the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesters the seed cleaners the seed
dryers and all you need for this crop
[SPEAKER_01]: without having long-term contracts and so
I do have a few varieties coming out and
[SPEAKER_01]: working with a with a processing company
in Illinois now on the Hollis pumpkin so
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe something will come of that
ornamental pumpkins pretty easy to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I can't claim I was a genius
working with these I've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties probably 30 varieties or so have
my germplasm and I you know it's just one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those things you know we're squash you
know I think I got a total of nine
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of squash you know but I've
spent a lot of time breeding squash and so
[SPEAKER_01]: and this for some reason my computer just
won't my upgraded computer won't accept
[SPEAKER_01]: the changes I've changed this table a
million times anyway the gist of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I came in 1967 these are the number
of genes that were described for these
[SPEAKER_01]: three species if you if you looked in the
literature now maybe I might have missed a
[SPEAKER_01]: few in the literature but but pretty much
this is it and and and half of them were
[SPEAKER_01]: described wrongly wrong at the wrong
inheritance model for them or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: okay and in 2017 these are just genes for
morphological traits morphological traits
[SPEAKER_01]: okay it's not including the genes for
diseases but even 2017 approximately 20
[SPEAKER_01]: genes in cucurbitum maxima that you can
trace the morphological traits 39 and
[SPEAKER_01]: people and nine in my shot that is really
not much at all okay most most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics I work with I'm not gonna say
most of I I mean I'm in I work with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of those genes but but there's so many so
much variation that I work with there's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually there's no genetic information on
it except what's in my breeding book and
[SPEAKER_01]: so as a breeder you've got two directions
you could go you know if I find if I find
[SPEAKER_01]: five traits I can either spend all my time
you know producing isogenic lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: making the crosses you know to publish an
inheritance study or I can release some
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties to grow I've made the selfish
choice perhaps to breed varieties for the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and maybe I'll write a book a
small book sometime just just detailing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know kind of what I know about these
descriptive morphological traits and I go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to my first breeding course was when
I was an undergraduate at Oklahoma State
[SPEAKER_01]: and this chart and an old breeding book by
Allard ice really struck me you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because because you see all this variation
in plants and and I was actually doing
[SPEAKER_01]: special projects for a couple breeders at
Oklahoma State at the time and I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my gosh if you have if you had four
recessive genes in a perfect population
[SPEAKER_01]: this was like your Punnett square perfect
population only one out of 256 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: would have all four of those genes
homozygous okay in other words true
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that's just with four four genes
now you're in much better shape you know
[SPEAKER_01]: about a about a third if it was all
dominant genes about a third of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: would would at least have at least one
dominant gene in it you know but and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're lucky enough to work with traits
that would have incomplete dominance
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a little better off because you can
see you can see the recessive phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: the dominant phenotype in the intermediate
phenotype but in squash this is important
[SPEAKER_01]: because your population size is limited
the biggest population I ever used in
[SPEAKER_01]: squash was 450 plants 450 plants a wheat
breeder would laugh at that it was a wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder that was teaching this course I
was taking you know of course he he was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about populations probably you
know f2 3000 wheat plants or something you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know in an acre in an acre of
squash breeding where we have guard rows
[SPEAKER_01]: and different plots and so forth you're
talking six to nine and whether it's bush
[SPEAKER_01]: or vine you're talking six to nine hundred
plants you know could be per acre is all
[SPEAKER_01]: you can grow you know and and you're not
going to devote all that to just one cross
[SPEAKER_01]: and and so it's it's quite restrictive and
remember it's not self pollinating species
[SPEAKER_01]: so any any plant that we say for the next
generation has to the flowers have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tied off you do your self pollinations and
then that continues the next generation
[SPEAKER_01]: okay and you can occasionally if like in
summer squash particularly if if you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get a self pollination and you've
already made you on summer squash you're
[SPEAKER_01]: already selecting what you need you know
by the time you pollinate it because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're interested in the immature fruit
then that's that you could make cuttings
[SPEAKER_01]: and take those to the greenhouse and
occasionally we have taken cuttings late
[SPEAKER_01]: the season but often you can't as soon as
the growing point gets again starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: senesce you can get your cutting to root
but we've tried different hormones and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we can't get the growing point
we can we could do it in tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're not willing to go there the same
way this is just a it's a simplified
[SPEAKER_01]: example but it kind of shows what you're
up against a lot of the traits we work
[SPEAKER_01]: with with like starch content and seed
size and fruit size to some extent are
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially what we call additive tray if
they're quantitative we call them additive
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're more qualitative traits we say
incomplete dominance but essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about where your where your
small a here is like had zero increment of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth this one increment growth to an
increment growth of course the different
[SPEAKER_01]: genes you know don't all affect the trait
in the same way but the point I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make here is if you have a quantity trait
that has additive genetic variation like
[SPEAKER_01]: in case of starch content it works out
very nice because you know that when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get your highest starch content in a
population you're likely to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: homozygosity and this is what we found if
we're you if you're breeding a processor
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want low very low dry matter
content you might be down at this end if
[SPEAKER_01]: you try to select for if you make a wide
cross with something high starch low
[SPEAKER_01]: starch then in here you're going to get
some homozygosity some homozygous lines
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of them you can have different
combinations which which would give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the same starch content but you have a lot
of heterozygosity makes selection very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult okay and remember you're dealing
with small populations another aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: that's important in if I'm dealing with
all those three species is sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable to transfer traits between these
species well forget Maxima times people
[SPEAKER_01]: okay very difficult to transfer genes
there's just too much sterility I tried
[SPEAKER_01]: this early on and didn't have any luck and
actually I there were some traits I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to transfer between cucurbit people acorn
squash and butternut squash I could never
[SPEAKER_01]: tried for five years to make that cross
and couldn't get it to work I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: in a second how I got it finally got it to
work but had to use embryo culture
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucurbit of Maxima and Machata if Maxima
is a female it's often you can get very
[SPEAKER_01]: good seed yields in this cross but the F1
is sterile okay and so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sterility barriers in the next generation
usually you can back cross using your F1
[SPEAKER_01]: as a female you can back cross and but the
other point I want to make is is it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: cut and dried you can't just say well you
can cross Maxima to Machata no I could I
[SPEAKER_01]: could take 20 lines and I could make this
cross some of them would cross very well
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them wouldn't cross at all some of
them give some fertility and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: with what we know maybe when we get
molecular markers and we understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that control this fine we could we
could find the parents they're gonna cross
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just a hit-and-miss you know
situation you know we were fortunate in
[SPEAKER_01]: Maxima that one of my processing bush
processors combines very well with Machata
[SPEAKER_01]: all of all the virtually all the different
Machata strains cross well with this one
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is in Maxima but it's not always to
do and I told you I couldn't cross acorn
[SPEAKER_01]: in Machata but I was able to make a cross
of acorn and pumpkin which is in the other
[SPEAKER_01]: subspecies and I was able to cross that to
Machata and they got seven seeds so we
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to culture those and get five
plants out of it and with those five
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I was able to back cross in either
direction and so why were we interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: that well acorn squash have very low
carotenoid content carotenoid is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the key nutrients in squash and so this is
just work we've just been doing lately
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just started working with
interspecies hybrids but anyway we think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is much higher carotenoid levels both
of these have much higher carotenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: levels then then we have in acorn squash
probably probably this one is probably I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: say three or four times what we usually
see in acorn so it really up would upgrade
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrition if we could get this level
of carotenoid into acorn the acorn squash
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an important squash acorn
butternut and buttercup kabocha those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the three major squash in supermarkets so
we took the same squash and crossed to
[SPEAKER_01]: Machata and got enough seeds so we could
grow out 15 plants and those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: segregated for intense pretty intense
carotenoid content and we're able to cross
[SPEAKER_01]: that with acorn we've only got a few seeds
partial embryos we're hoping this winter
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can culture those new embryo
culture and recover plants to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: that project my actually first interest in
these interspecies hybrids was to make
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses between Maxima golden malicious
and a processing type like large cheese or
[SPEAKER_01]: Dickinson field and we wanted to see what
the yield would be in the f1 and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason for that is a we had a hypothesis
that because these f1 hybrids are sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't produce seeds that we could
increase yield because all the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthate energy could go to the flesh
and not the seed and sure enough and we
[SPEAKER_01]: got a nice phenotype it's semi bush
because we're crossing bush times vine and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the yields were really quite
staggering compared to our our check which
[SPEAKER_01]: was a Dickinson field type I got from root
seeds the dry matter yield was almost
[SPEAKER_01]: double in this particular interspecies
hybrid some of them don't work at all some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them produce misshapen fruit another
avenue of research because the
[SPEAKER_01]: interspecies hybrid even if we get higher
yields the processor is not likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: adopt it because of difficulties in seed
production but so we've been using some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the interspecies hybrids as root stocks
for melon to overcome vine decline that
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs throughout the northeast melon and
sure enough we can overcome that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: borne disease quite easily on root stocks
can increase yield by 50% and also extend
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing season we think this this
could be important in the future well
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not a lot of milk melon acreage in
New England but still we're in and the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds the seed production is again
expensive and one of the things I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do is we've been able to take some
of these maxima intermediate maxima
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and cross them to a butternut and
I originally the idea of this we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a butternut shape in maxima and we
just haven't been able to do that just
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been able to transfer those genes
back to maxima but the interesting thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is through a series of crosses we did end
up with with pretty much standard
[SPEAKER_01]: butternut and that's only after a few back
crosses three back crosses to machata we
[SPEAKER_01]: since you have a butternut type what's
advantage this the seed fertility is a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent so if if we can use if we
can take this and cross it back to maxima
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can get hundred percent of
well-filled seeds you know and if if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: compatible with melon and gives the same
melon yields and and disease resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: then it could be a major breakthrough in
the industry because normally when you
[SPEAKER_01]: make these crosses a good share of the
seed is not filled you got to do and even
[SPEAKER_01]: with commercial seed that we've tried you
do the grafting studies and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed doesn't germinate uniformly
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I'm gonna have to go through this
real quick but another area variation is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we look for is in carbohydrate source
the balance of sugars and starch that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what really really determines whether a
squash is tastes good or is edible there's
[SPEAKER_01]: other other factors but sugars and starch
don't totally don't dominate the edibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of squat and then in terms of vitamin
content of course the carotenoids are and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go through this because I'm
running out of time but the thing I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to show you is it's very expensive to
measure starch content okay takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions even if you send it off it's
very expensive and you need to send a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of material to be analyzed and so we don't
measure starch but the interesting thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is starch is correlated very strongly at
harvest with the percent dry weight and we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that if you have a percent dry matter
in the squash up around 18 to 20 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: your starch content is going to be around
eight or nine percent and if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: squash with that starch content has a nice
pasty texture a very desirable texture and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's enough starch to produce high sugar
content so it results in a good balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar and starch the interesting thing is
in in the commercial varieties they fall
[SPEAKER_01]: in the two most popular or three most
popular commercial varieties they fall
[SPEAKER_01]: into dry matter contents in in all our
trials average about 11% and I can I can
[SPEAKER_01]: go to a supermarket in the winter time or
most any time and I can test acorn squash
[SPEAKER_01]: from a supermarket not kabocha squash or
butternut but acorn squash in there they
[SPEAKER_01]: test out between 9 and 11 percent
essentially we would call these inedible
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially we would call these inedible
and so again we so we just get percent dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter so we just get these small samples
dry them down determined percent dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter sugars are expensive to measure so
we just get soluble solids we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: correlates with sugar content we know of
soluble solids contents not above 11
[SPEAKER_01]: percent then the squash is not going to
have an adequate balance of sugar so it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes for for pretty easy selection and
again the dry weight in squash usually
[SPEAKER_01]: peaks about 35 days after pollination as I
mentioned before and and it will tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: go down if the squash is harvested or if
the vine and if the vine is senescing too
[SPEAKER_01]: much then actually the dry matter will
tend to degrade and there's a again all
[SPEAKER_01]: these squash have have high dry matter and
decent quality but your commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties would be you know off the chart
the same thing with sugar we we've
[SPEAKER_01]: selected we've selected inbred lines that
start degrading starts very early in
[SPEAKER_01]: development and so by 45 days they are
already reaching soluble solids contents
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 12 percent or above and so again
it leads to quality of harvest what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with that and and I'll probably
finish up on this is that yield goes down
[SPEAKER_01]: as quality goes up why is that most of you
can answer that question squash produces
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have starch that's the main
component okay that's the main
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic reserve other than the seed
so if you're getting squash a fruit with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of starch in it okay is requires a lot
more photosynthetic energy and a fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: that has less starch and so it's not a
one-to-one relationship because because
[SPEAKER_01]: both fruit have seed in them and maybe the
seed is utilizing about say 20 to 25
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of the photosynthetic energy is
going into seed development but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest goes into fruit and particularly
starts development and so if a grower is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing squash for the supermarkets I
can't convince that grower to grow my
[SPEAKER_01]: variety that tastes better if the
supermarket is squash look nice you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going into the supermarket and
it's what the supermarket wants why should
[SPEAKER_01]: he grow a squash that yields you know less
and it's a conundrum and it makes it very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult so most of my varieties I'm
releasing are going to smaller companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are willing to market for local
markets they're willing to market high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: squash I'd like to get a supermarket chain
to market squash as a variety and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they could they can introduce a variety
that has good eating quality they would
[SPEAKER_01]: increase their sales of squash it's
difficult to do and I'll just leave you
[SPEAKER_01]: with a message if you're if you're in a
store and you want to get an acorn squash
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat realize that at two weeks after
pollination the ground spot where the
[SPEAKER_01]: squash was lying on the ground is light
green because it doesn't doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun you need the sunlight to get the
chlorophyll synthesis in the brine and so
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go into a supermarket and take a
look at this is what you often this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture I took in a supermarket and
usually in the winters when you see it so
[SPEAKER_01]: when were they squash harvest probably
between 20 and 25 days after fruit 20 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 days they're totally immature there's
there's literally no sugar in them they're
[SPEAKER_01]: low dry matter they're essentially in
edible you know and yet this is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what the stores are and it's not because
the stores don't want quality it's because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't they don't know how to evaluate
a fruit like acorn they don't you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't you can't converse with them on
that I mean it's just like hitting your
[SPEAKER_01]: head against the wall this is interesting
because it's this big chewy actually they
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver one of our major supermarket
chains they're a big grower I think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: located they have locations in Mexico and
other areas and in the fall this was
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest in the fall so their source of
squash in the fall at least when when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get this orange ground spot it means the
skin has has accumulated carotenoids in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's probably close to at least 40
days after fruit set so it's got maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: starch content might not be too high in
sugar but this squash was actually edible
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say it was top of the line but was
actually edible and this is what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to show you we do all these cooking
tests and we have tremendous variation in
[SPEAKER_01]: carotenoid content we've also done
carotenoid profiles we can't do that right
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment because I don't have access
to the lab but what this profile has
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed us to do we can identify for
instance we can identify lines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: high in beta-carotene I can identify them
just with the naked eye and we use this
[SPEAKER_01]: color fan we only use the last seven
colors these colors don't don't correlate
[SPEAKER_01]: with carotenoid content and we can only do
it with cucarbina machata and maxima the
[SPEAKER_01]: carotenoids are so low and acorn that we
can't use it but this is very handy some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the seed companies I work with use this
color fan it was developed for eggs and
[SPEAKER_01]: you wonder well why would that work for
squash because the eggs eggs contain
[SPEAKER_01]: xanthyls like hydroxylated carotenoids you
think would be more yellowish but anyway
[SPEAKER_01]: it works works fine I'm gonna end right
there on that show thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any questions well I can start out
with the question do you guys actually
[SPEAKER_00]: breed for the strength of stem when you're
looking when you're breeding pumpkins yes
[SPEAKER_01]: okay do I breed for the stem yeah you
actually do because it's important right
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we did some research on those and
in certain varieties will accumulate
[SPEAKER_01]: lignin and cellulose faster than others
but you have the same problem with with
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for stem strength to some extent
as you have for breeding starch content
[SPEAKER_01]: because the dry matter in the flesh the
starch content in the flesh it's a storage
[SPEAKER_01]: organ for sugar it feeds into the stem and
helps the stem to harden okay and what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've found is that varieties that are
that are lowest in dry matter have the
[SPEAKER_01]: weakest stems so if you raise the dry
matter in a pumpkin to get better stem
[SPEAKER_01]: strength you tend to lower the yield of
the but we've gotten around that to some
[SPEAKER_02]: extent but I mean that's just that's a
good question and I might add that in
[SPEAKER_01]: these show pumpkins there's fanatical
growers there's a there's Association New
[SPEAKER_01]: Hampshire and I've spoke to them a couple
of times well they want answers you know
[SPEAKER_01]: how can I get the largest pumpkin and just
the physiology of why these pumpkins grow
[SPEAKER_01]: big and just the physiology of growth in
itself is very complex you know in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's going on and cell division and
cell size and so forth and so I have not
[SPEAKER_01]: given them I've learned more from these
growers and they've learned from me but
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway it's very interesting and they're
always interested all these are some
[SPEAKER_01]: growth regulators I can spray on these get
them bigger and so forth and so on any
[SPEAKER_02]: other questions that's a good question did
you hear the questions are a correlation
[SPEAKER_01]: between storage and starch and sugar
content so what happens you know pumpkins
[SPEAKER_01]: respire you know when you harvest a
pumpkin the squash it was it was spars so
[SPEAKER_01]: you put a squash in storage for one thing
the carotenoid content tends to go up
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in the machatas increase it
will increase it depends on the variety
[SPEAKER_01]: but increases between three weeks to eight
weeks and then and then peaks so actually
[SPEAKER_01]: the vitamin content actually tends to
increase in not so much an acorn but in
[SPEAKER_01]: kabocha and the other thing that happens
is the starch breaks down into sugar you
[SPEAKER_01]: have respiration so the starch starts
continue breaks down and you tend to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little higher sugar and storage so the
breakdown of starch is usually proceeds
[SPEAKER_01]: faster than the respiration so you tend
tend to get higher sugar and like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: butternuts sometimes they have to be
stored for some time in order to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar content upward balance with starch
and what they found in studies and we
[SPEAKER_01]: followed up on this New Zealand's done the
most thorough work on squash because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a major export item and the government
actually funds applied work on squash and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they showed is is that they could
they could take squash and they could
[SPEAKER_01]: treat it with high temperature like 30
degrees C for five or six days and that
[SPEAKER_01]: accelerated the enzymes which break down
starch and and then they could take that
[SPEAKER_01]: squash and put it back in the preferred
storage temperature say 10 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: centigrade and the degradation would
continue because when they ship their
[SPEAKER_01]: squash to Japan and it reaches Japan it's
going to be a minimum of 20% dry matter
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum of 11% soluble solids so that work
is important so now in my squash comes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the greenhouse I tell the greenhouse
manager I said bump up the temperature for
[SPEAKER_01]: a week you know because I got I have to
get the sugar content up my machete is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work with a company in New
Zealand I got to send seed to them so I
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta I gotta do cooking tests on those
squash and so that's an important thing
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to understand now it used to be that
they they did that to all squash and they
[SPEAKER_01]: do it with sweet potato as you cure them
it turns out that the squash don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be cured to for disease or anything like
that because you know 55 60 degrees you
[SPEAKER_01]: know there they can actively get corky
layers to prevent diseases really not much
[SPEAKER_01]: different but it turns out if you want to
get if you want to sell your squash until
[SPEAKER_01]: growers if you want to sell your butternut
squash you're growing the waltham variety
[SPEAKER_01]: which happens to be very low in sugar
harvest that most popular variety has the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest sugar harvest practically any
variety I've looked at and so I say well
[SPEAKER_01]: bump up the temperature you know when
you're put them in the greenhouse for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or whatever and bump up the
temperature and at least you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing them within three or four weeks
and the customers are gonna be satisfied
[SPEAKER_01]: if you eat a squash it doesn't have a
balance of sugar and it even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly low dry matter it's like eating a
dog bone just not good that was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: question yes I guess it would depend on
when an environmental stress occurred but
[SPEAKER_01]: early on I would say would you don't need
that much sugar you know as a substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: for carotenoids because the total content
micrograms compared to sugar content so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know some of the highest carotenoid
contents are in fruit with with only six
[SPEAKER_01]: percent dry matter the Dickinson field
type but I would think an environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: stress I don't have any I don't have any
direct information
[SPEAKER_02]: if you leave your leaf area you know your
starch content since you can get a storage
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing I might add is when once
you once squash comes off the vine or the
[SPEAKER_01]: vine dies it turns out the respiration
bumps up double no one's ever looked into
[SPEAKER_01]: this work done again in New Zealand but
it's something to think about you know
[SPEAKER_02]: keep your respiration rate lower this has
been a production of Cornell University on
[SPEAKER_00]: the web at Cornell.edu you you
