[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I see it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some familiar faces, people who
visit my store, people who I know through
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through my presentation
and kind of just talk about the general
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of the kind of work we do and who
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I lecture different places,
whether it be Cornell or IC or TC3 or
[SPEAKER_00]: other universities and conferences,
I think the funnest part, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: is some of the interaction, the questions
that people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful that they kind of work with
that we've done with our farm as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: our whole animal butchery is a little bit
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I find that it generates questions
and clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of enjoy those discussions
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope that you follow Phelan's,
that's hard to say two words in a row,
[SPEAKER_00]: follow Phelan's prompt to ask some
questions afterward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also I like to be interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome to stop me and ask
questions along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quick show of hands, who's been to my
shop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to buy anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of curious what you guys
have known about our shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just gives you a general flavor of
who we are many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we run because of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gives you the general flavor of like
who we are and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that I would kind of just do
a little general overview of our work for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who aren't familiar with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually over years have developed
from a very small business, which I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in a second, to a somewhat
larger business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a little bit under $3 million in
sales a year now, which I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful for that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, it goes right back out the door
in receivables and payables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're very thankful because that means
that $3 million more is being spent and
[SPEAKER_00]: given to farmers in our local community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We split into two different corporations
in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our business started in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Piggery Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: is our USDA certified meat processing
facility that's right there on Franklin
[SPEAKER_00]: Street across from the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like many of you guys have been
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really focus in that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, creating value added pork and
turkey products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pork comes from myself and three
other local farms, as well as we sponsor a
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning farmer on our land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he raises all the turkey that you'll
ever find at the Piggery or other stores
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Piggery Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well is our local meats grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you guys probably see the
front end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But behind that is one of the smallest
USDA certified butchering facilities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire country, which I'll talk about
a little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Piggery Farm, which is our farm is
raised over in Trumanburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own 70 acres and we farm approximately
about 110 because we lease about 40 acres
[SPEAKER_00]: from our neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are really focused on the work we
do out there, which is raising heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: breed hogs out on sustainably managed
pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: My farm is actually certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are deadly serious about feeding
them non-GMO feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the general overview of
the two different businesses that we run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why did we, how did we become the
Piggery?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first moved to our land in 2004,
we were really excited to come back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband Brad also had gone to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have family in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got really interested in
sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really before the cusp of the
next farm to table movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider the first one that happened
back in the 70s, the back to the land
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was really as things were kind of
coming out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this idea that we wanted to
homestead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with that term,
it's the idea of raising your kind of most
[SPEAKER_00]: of your food and your needs all there on
your land and also being able to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we had a little bit of everything at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both had off farm jobs, but we were
raising a couple of cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to do milking cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I had some sheep that somebody
dumped off at my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had roosters and chickens and guinea
fowl, a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the first year we raised three pigs
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the opportunity to work with all
these different animals really helped us
[SPEAKER_00]: hone in on what we felt passionate about
and what we felt that was good about our
[SPEAKER_00]: land and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was mentioning to Fallon and also your
administrator here that when I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, we didn't have any resource like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my class being sustainable
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture was my favorite class that I
ever took.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't a student farm or
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thankful that you guys have the
opportunity to maybe put your hands in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explore what seems right to you and
passionate about farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of keep going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's us being able to kind of develop
our land in that time period for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three years, you know, kind of helped show
us like what works for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, it's raising pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a logistical standpoint, they're a
lot easier to work with than cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigs you only need fences up to your
kneecaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cows, you need to have all these
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day before I got married, all my cows
broke out and were running around the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my entire wedding party had to help me
move them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cows can be a little bit hard to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigs are a lot easier to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really fascinated with the idea of
trying to develop some grazing strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: for pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking back 10, 12 years,
it's not something that had been like
[SPEAKER_00]: really fleshed out in modern small scale
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Brad had gone to the French
Culinary School in New York City when we
[SPEAKER_00]: lived there for a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really fascinated out of all
the animals that we worked with,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you could actually do with a pig
carcass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever come to our store,
I'm really proud of how we use as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: the animal as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from a mission statement from our
farm, if we're harvesting these animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to make sure that we're using as
much of them as possible to feed people or
[SPEAKER_00]: for other uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also from an economical standpoint,
if I can sell the smoked pig ears for
[SPEAKER_00]: $1.50 for dog treats, if I can make a
sriracha infused whiplard that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: buy at $3 a jar for a sandwich spread or
paleo style sandwich spread, it really
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps the overall cost of our meat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hope is to make local sustainable
meat as accessible and as affordable as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we found our market and our work
that we did, we were, again, passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about sustainable farming 10, 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would go to every farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed that it was really
difficult to source local meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the farm to table movement was
quite a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys been going to the farmer's
market for years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pointing it to my customers that come
in all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys remember like 15
years ago, you'd go to the farmer's market
[SPEAKER_00]: and there'd be wonderful veggies,
but you'd see some white kind of coolers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the back of the pickup truck and a
hand-scrawled sign about meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring that up, it was hard to find local
meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there, but it wasn't really as
front and center or available as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was often, all of it was frozen,
so there was no fresh varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it was packaged poorly,
not to the fault of the farmer or really
[SPEAKER_00]: the fault of the slaughterhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only, if you're selling, maybe you guys
have learned this already, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sell meat to a consumer,
it has to be slaughtered and packaged and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled at a USDA facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our local cut shops, few and far
between, great people, but they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: flying through those carcasses as fast as
they can without like a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: their focus is not creating a great end
product for someone to be attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to put something that someone
can throw in their freezer and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also noticed culturally around
here at least that most of the meat cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would find at the farmer's market
were kind of unfamiliar and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unconventional and unfamiliar to people
visiting the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rump roasts always seem to be in high
stocking at the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what to do with a rump roast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just looking at that and kind
of thinking like, wouldn't it be neat if
[SPEAKER_00]: we cut meat fresh from our farm every
single week and brought it to the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if we made things that seemed a
little bit more familiar to people like
[SPEAKER_00]: deli meats?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do some fun things like
charcuterie, pateis, and spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could make fresh sausages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go to our friend's booth across
the way and buy fresh herbs and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: really fantastic sausage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of thought, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought it would be funner,
interesting, and really kind of bring
[SPEAKER_00]: local meat to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as a hobby, we had other jobs and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, this kind of crazy idea
was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to accomplish this?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, that you have to,
if you're going to sell meat to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, it has to be USDA slaughtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: A loophole is that it doesn't necessarily
have to be USDA processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get too into too much into my
menu, she'll let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to Wegman's or Top and they
have a meat department back there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to go buy meat from,
they're all inspected under the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State Ag and Markets 20C facility license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means they can bring a half a
beef in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cut it, make their own grind
in-house, and sell it direct to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we kind of looked into all the
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out we could actually do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thought we were crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were originally under, and now it's
much more commonplace, but 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone thought we were crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were originally in the exotics
category for Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what to do with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we built a very simple kitchen,
which I think I have some pictures later
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started going and bringing still
our pigs to slaughter one or two a week at
[SPEAKER_00]: a slaughterhouse, bringing the carcasses
back and cutting and making meats from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we kind of developed our
line of pets and sausage and charcuterie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you, we didn't know what
we were doing out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were self-taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad had a little bit of knowledge from
culinary school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before YouTube, so there's no
videos to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We largely taught ourselves how to cut
meat from books in the basement of my
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first went to market, we had fresh
sausages and charcuterie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people were starting to ask for
things like tenderloins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized at that point we were
cutting all our tenderloins up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the prime cut of the pig,
and making sausage out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, OK, we should probably start
bringing cuts to market, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said that the pigery is a
community project for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned so much from our community,
and we exist because they taught us things
[SPEAKER_00]: and kept coming back to show us.
[SPEAKER_00]: True story, when I was like, I didn't know
how to wrap meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would wrap meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd bring our meat in the coolers to the
farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a health department licensed to
wrap meat on site as a catering license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a French customer hop behind my
booth one day, and she was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me show you how to wrap meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like wrapping a Christmas present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she taught me how to wrap meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She still comes in all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, we were selling our meat
at the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we expanded into doing a meat
share, which is similar to a CSA,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did direct and through other farm
groups that had veggie CSAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, with this license,
we were unable to wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it didn't really matter to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still trying to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason that it mattered to us
that we weren't able to wholesale is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it blocked our mission,
which was to make local pasture-raised
[SPEAKER_00]: meat accessible and familiar and out there
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: To back up, the reason I couldn't
wholesale is because I didn't have a USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: processing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could go to USDA slaughter,
back to New York State processing,
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to a restaurant or your local
grocery store, I would have to have a USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: processing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you saw my basement, I promise it
was really clean and brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no way in heck that the USDA
would ever let me have a license down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we tried to make things really
try to engage the customers in what we
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett and I are goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought a sushi case to display our meat
at the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how I mentioned before everything
was in coolers back there and unfamiliar?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really kind of brought it out there and
tried to tell people about what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and how we kind of connected with
our customers, make a good space,
[SPEAKER_00]: get really concise on what we were talking
about, which was we raised heritage breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: pasture-raised animals, processed in our
off-the-grid kitchen, which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also solar wind powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just always do a good job for our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling us for orders and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how we kept developing
our work that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never had any money, and we still
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll never see advertisements for the
piggery anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we always try to connect with people
by doing a weekly newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never missed a week, I think,
in the eight years we've been in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our outlet to explain to people what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hand out samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do press releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what chaos is happening in the
butcher shop behind the scenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to always make sure that stuff is
there for when our customers come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're depending on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we learned during this time period
is that processing two or three pigs a
[SPEAKER_00]: week for our farmer's market on top of
farming and everything, it just
[SPEAKER_00]: financially wasn't very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys are learning
about that in your classwork now about
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing and selling and fixed costs and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're super real things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as Brad and I were having fun
and having off-farm jobs, farming and
[SPEAKER_00]: butchering and farmer's markets,
it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the kind of work we were doing,
it was financially unsustainable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long term, if we ever wanted fancy things
like health insurance, which we still
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, we decided we had to just
basically, it's a volume thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to keep processing more
animals to make our model work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to try to expand into
another market a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I could only sell direct to
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as the Ithaca market was great
and supportive, there's only so much you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do in a few hours on the weekend at
the farmer's market to sell to your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed, I think what is still
known as the first meat CSA program for
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was about 10 years ago,
about eight years ago, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went down to the city for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we distributed boxed meat shares at
bars around the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was five different locations that we
would go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of just really tried to be
creative with the roadblocks that we
[SPEAKER_00]: presented with the kind of farming that we
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in the long term in
doing forestry work or doing just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables or eggs, eggs are a little
tricky, you're going to find the markets
[SPEAKER_00]: are much more open to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get into things like dairies
and meats, you really have some
[SPEAKER_00]: governmental sort of constraints and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that they should
stop you from doing the kind of farming
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to meet your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be a little bit creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went down to New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York City was a challenge because
it's really big and we had no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it was just social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We begged a space at a friend's bar for
one night to do a tasting and rode the bus
[SPEAKER_00]: down and then posted all over the
neighborhood with the little flyers about
[SPEAKER_00]: our CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we managed to get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our goal was to have like 45
shares down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was 90, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able, within the huge city of New
York City, to get 90 people to buy into
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were doing, which was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is everyone here familiar with the CSA
concept?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the veggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that you're investing in your farmer
in advance for them to do their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some really cool things came out
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like kind of word spread that we
were doing this crazy thing that got us
[SPEAKER_00]: the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bacon was on the Time Out New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were in all the edible
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a big article in the New
York Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling news about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been like some of those getting
press for your farm and the work that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing to kind of helping to
keep you in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to recap, we're farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working 100 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to the farmer's market doing
CSAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my crew members on the farm said to
me, I don't understand why you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little place downtown in Ithaca to sell
your meat and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never run a retail store before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seemed incredibly scary to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bought the coffee shop that was
across the street from the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: market, which is directly attached to the
building where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a small drive-through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the numbers were that the coffee sales
and the bagels through that drive-through
[SPEAKER_00]: window paid for the rent and overhead of
the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is our new spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But next door to it, we moved in a
four-foot case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sold meat out of it out of the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would come in and buy meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a whole expresso line
happening behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we kind of like shoehorned
our way into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at someone's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shoehorned our way into having like
kind of a little store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how our brands evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just kind of just kept at it and
just tried to keep our vision ahead of us
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just trying to find ways around
the industrial food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reach our customers and reach people
who are interested in our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but we noticed, still during that
time, even though we had our little store,
[SPEAKER_00]: again under the state license,
so I could sell direct to the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, that we're still getting calls
from people that we kind of considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be our community still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these great restaurateurs in town are
like, you know, I'd love to buy from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone besides Cisco, but we couldn't
because of our license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't sell direct to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Star have been calling me for years
and grocery stores in New York City like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we would love to buy like a local
product versus just some big international
[SPEAKER_00]: meat company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we started kind of like
really rethinking like what it meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of service people who are asking for
have access to this kind of meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to bite the bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about two years of working with
some big regional economic development
[SPEAKER_00]: firms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone told us that we couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably should listen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the back of the Franklin Street
location that you guys see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put a bunch of cooler banks on the
back of it and repurposed the old kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: of the restaurant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we developed one of the smallest USDA
shops in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to invest in a lot of new
equipment because like, as I said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA was never would have certified my
basement of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very specific about how things
get cut and packaged and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of like our fundraising with
these economic groups, we're heading a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of new equipment and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of one of the end
products is that this is a five pound pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of sausage that we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our signature sausage named after our
farm in Teaberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to go to a restaurant
someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so still mountains of work left to do
and kind of keep moving the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: forward of small farms having access to
larger markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tough to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some really good success at
small grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any big chain is really, really hard
to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I touched on a little before is
that you need a certain level of volume to
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome your fixed costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's always just having the
right volume to do the level of quality
[SPEAKER_00]: work that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, some other struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restaurants are pretty price sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their food costing and margins that
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still trying to kind of just keep
tweaking the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the right mix of selling
direct to our customers in the retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing wholesale, all these sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing I have any experience in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a tremendous learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of sleepless nights from both joy
and tears, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we even do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys are all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of you who work are involved
with the student farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been out there when the sun's
shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all is right in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know that you're growing
animals and food the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really, what it boils down to,
we're really passionate about animals
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good or decent life before
they're harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our animals are raised closer to
about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the grocery store,
those are commodity animals in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're about four or five months to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our animals are truly all pasture
raised around the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge woodlot system at our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we practice mob grazing, which is where
we rotate them every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our acre plotage is an old farm
that has paddocks there of about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: acres or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all surrounded by the
hedgerows, which helps us kind of keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them shaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this work because restaurants get to
use our sausage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kilpatrick's in downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making traditional Scotch eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to be creative with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carcasses, this is jowl bacon,
which I don't think modern pork facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was a really traditional cut back
in the day when people were putting meat
[SPEAKER_00]: up for the wintertime to cure and smoke
your jowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another reason we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful day getting drinks of water
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks to some of my partner farms
here that we've worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the folks that helped get us
all financed and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we covered a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of it's very specific to the
licensing that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't pretend that wasn't a big part
of all the work that we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy to answer any questions that
you guys might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question, if everyone heard it,
is do we think there's that balance of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get the volume right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have plans to keep expanding,
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as long as it's within our mission,
to let us keep doing our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always trying to get the formula
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple different ways you can
sell your meat product, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: retail, at the farmer's market or through
our retail counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a higher margin point,
although there's a lot of overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have staff, you have lighting,
all those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can sell more through the wholesale
market, but you get a much lower margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always kind of trying to play
with all those load numbers to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extremely complicated business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go back to answering your
question more specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that challenges us with getting
really tight on our numbers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: every week, we really are a whole lot of
butchery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every week I have 25 to 30 animals that
we're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each cut has a different value or a
different purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sell pork chops and bacons all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sell head cheese all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only sell so much sausage, so much hot
dogs, so much bologna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of my work these days is really
just trying to work with my accounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how to balance the
carcasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always constantly looking at
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I can make so many different
things from my raw material source,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if I have extra shoulder, I can make
fresh sausage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make cottage bacon, which is your
smoked shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably shouldn't hit that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: My AV guy's like, what are you guys doing
back there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You make your pork shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make some deli meats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capicola is traditionally made with the
shoulder meat of the pig as the salami is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take some of that trim and make
hot dogs with it if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can roll it out and do a stuffed pork
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those different things have different
inputs into them as far as ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time in the smoker, slicer lost,
perishability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting formula to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of now, we are pretty challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any given time, financially,
to just keep pushing ahead a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we are now is we're stuck in the
debt service cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about three and a half years
left on some of the build-out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of hanging in through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To accomplish that, we have to do some
more volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our target is to maybe do 15% to
20% more in the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're trying to get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to maybe do some festivals
this summer and do some other avenues to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little bit more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growing by 15% or 20% in the next year
or two also feels really good to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year in particular, I've had other
local farmers with it, we're very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: about our farming practices, knocking on
my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, please, can you help me find an
outlet for this meat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you buy from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you process this meat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it out the door?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can grow and keep our business
healthy, perhaps pay my crew members a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more, and be able to source
more from Finger Lakes Farms, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I am on the volume play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the long answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, apart from labor,
energy, cash, USDA regulations,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the major bottlenecks facing your
sector, your small scale producers at
[SPEAKER_04]: large?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go first and foremost on USDA
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not giving them a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they're so stringent and based
in history, they're fairly inflexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really doesn't leave any space in
those bylaws to the USDA for scalability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant, let me just give you some
scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys can come take a tour if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was $1.5 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big number for a lot of small
producers to overcome that cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like, and if you don't do a USDA
facility, you have that huge loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: access to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think it's just that with the,
I'm not a historian, but I do like to read
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that with the Green Revolution
that happened in the 70s and the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrialization of the farming system,
we lost a lot of infrastructure that was
[SPEAKER_00]: important to small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a long time ago,
but I still have, if you come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: piggery on the left-hand side,
you'll see a milk can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my grandfather's milk can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over in Wyoming County, New York,
and all the farms around him, the
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman would usually have off-farm
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandpa was a machinist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every morning, they would go and milk
their cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a herd of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would leave their milk cans at
the end of the driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the milk company would come pick it
up, process it, chill it, and then bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: it and re-deliver it to people all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean about infrastructure
and distribution systems that could
[SPEAKER_00]: support a small farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find there's so many challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main one, USDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to capital is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much energy around small
farmers wanting to get into industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got back from the New York State
Organic Farming Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many great ideas and things that people
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it boils down to it, it is a
business where you've got to pay the bills
[SPEAKER_00]: one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't the driving force.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only driving force is that you
want to do your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So access to capital, infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, I'll say access to
markets is pretty challenging for small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered all your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go look at the piggies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swoon, swoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love farming questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do these kind of things,
I don't get a ton of farming questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we raise, we really focus on heritage
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do something that's called a
farmer's nick, which hasn't served us well
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain point in the marketing of our
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's some sexy breeds out there
like Duroc and Berkshire, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That companies will market them as
Berkshire pork or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been big fans of cross-breeding
since day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a little bit of everything
that's attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Duroc's and Herford's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gloucester old spot with the big
floppy eyes are a big part of our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the backbone of the work that we do
are mulefoot hogs, which is the rarest
[SPEAKER_00]: North American lard breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really fun animals to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with the Livestock Conservancy
to bring them to our farm and have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them throughout the region now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't use them as purebreds because
they're so lardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their loins and bacons are so short.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're great if we mix in about an
eighth into our breeding line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really great foragers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have really great meat marbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yorkshires are a nice mix in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're like the white pigs that
will kind of lean out all those fatty pigs
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little Tamworth sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our farmer's nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We currently do farrow to finish only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't buy pigs into our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are farrowing and producing piglets
about 10 to 12 litters per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have at any given time, because we're
always harvesting fresh and also having
[SPEAKER_00]: births, we're on average anywhere from
like 600 to 700 pigs at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are kind of like,
oh my god, that's so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York State Pork Association,
which I'm not part of, but they consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small New York State pork farm as
10,000 head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still a joke in the overall
industry in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you come on to my farm for a tour
sometimes, people are always surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's not 700 pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to picture like someone
like this, and someone like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and someone like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's spread over several different
age groups at 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep stretching that number every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you'll notice behind there,
we're not keeping up on our pasture right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to work through our pastures
every couple of days and keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the amount of acreage we have,
rotating isn't even keeping up with kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of keeping some of the weeds down,
which is our end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say something about farming our
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got out there in 2004,
it was strip mined to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had 20 years of heavy industrial corn
and soy rotations on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our soil testing was just off the
hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything grows in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two of our back pastures were almost
like desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the term is for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was almost like tumbleweeds
rolling around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nothing would grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rocky, maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so we'd get some weeds down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After working our animals through the land
for this period of time, it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a rainforest in the
summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so lush and so vibrant, we can't keep
up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just had this huge build of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from working with the animals on a
kind of a permaculture perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't keep them inside in factory
settings, which I think is silly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and feed them there, and just work against
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let them use the restroom outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not ever rotating them, so it's not
building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land has responded in kind with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I answer all your questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you promised?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as much as we'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hoping over the years to try to
get more focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had seeded white clover years ago,
which has really done nice for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot of reseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose white clover and Ladino clover,
because it has a higher protein level to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the summertime, we can get away from
really minimizing any non-GMO soy or other
[SPEAKER_00]: protein supplements that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying the last couple of years
to plant in winter rye and veg rotation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has worked awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's usually the first thing that
we're working in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always play with models about planting
corn or other crops for the animals to hog
[SPEAKER_00]: off, which is what farmers used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just don't have any of the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run our whole farm off of a Kubota mule
and a skid steer and hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as far as an infrastructure
improvement, we never can seem to get for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to make sense for us to get tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even if we are certified organic,
so we really would have to do some work to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just, in the meantime,
going to stick to doing as long as we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little bit tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to just not burn
ourselves out, think about things that
[SPEAKER_00]: excite us, which is doing further crop
rotations, and maybe kind of doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: hogging off in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in the general plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we have some,
in addition to the clover that we work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, which we're really big fans of,
we've got some really great things like
[SPEAKER_00]: tree foot foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bird's foot tree foil is really great and
high in protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty prolific in our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them really dig in certain areas
they want to dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love burdock roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're omnivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do like to look for all the
slugs and grubs and earthworms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing so hardily in all that organic
matter now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have quite a few trees in the
hedgerows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been fun to watch them eat all
the walnuts and acorns and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that that fall too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go there and I'll go back to
you next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hay that I get from my neighbor
that I've gotten from last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he brings me hay once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll kind of pick through that and
eat on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do always have them on full
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do corn on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do kind of traditional small grains,
which I can talk more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triticale is a big one for us since it has
a nice high level of protein in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also use weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like oat very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley is fantastic to use for the pigs
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time of the year, everybody has
non-GMO soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies between whether it's the Latini
moms or the smaller newborns, about 70
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds at this point that need a little
bit more protein at the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, it's really just cut down
to the weaned group of pigs that get the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I came back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have developed your business
model really with creativity and from
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, are you aware of other
kind of farms and businesses like yours in
[SPEAKER_01]: the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of a group that comes
together and exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to do and what not to do and how to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking that question and the
nice words.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started, it felt a little
bit lonely because we didn't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody doing exactly the kind of work,
especially some of the whole animal
[SPEAKER_00]: butchery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a good three or four years before
it got super sexy and was in every Wall
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Journal article down in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people thought we were a little bit
strange for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't really have a lot of,
always good people we could talk to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one else was really doing what we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Stockman Grass Farmer Journal is one
of my favorite publications in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody read that here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested, isn't it amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, Ellen Nation is like my future
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into grass fed meats,
it's called the Stockman Grassman Journal,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google it and it's really a great
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small farm focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so reading things like that would
always make me feel kind of connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: other farmers to see what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was national based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the internet has gone,
has spawned really, I mean back then it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, I mean this was 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet was there, but it's not like
how it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really great Facebook groups
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locally there's a farmer to farmer
networking group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nationally there's something called
Pastured Pig Raising, which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like 50,000 members on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the most active Facebook group
in the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as I've been pasture raising
my pigs, I learn something new every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going forward from there,
about six years ago somebody organized
[SPEAKER_00]: something called the New England Meat
Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time something like
that had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of us butchers and meat farmers
were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were so dorkily excited to talk to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to have that resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also went to one in Charlotte
recently for women in butchering,
[SPEAKER_00]: our new women butchering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really fun to connect with
other young English women who were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the butchering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't there, but it's definitely
developing and it's been really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we think about expansion for
other animals, it's interesting to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: business partner because we always,
I think we compliment each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll have different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad is much more interested in going in
that direction than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run operations downtown, so for me it's
a lot stickier having to process different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal species, make new products,
deal with USDA labeling, find new markets
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always prefer to stick to what we do
best to a certain point, which is pork.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten into turkey now and kind of
just really honing in on those two skill
[SPEAKER_00]: sets and getting better at that all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe advising other people
around beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with a local farmer to do a
lamb project, and I'm processing her
[SPEAKER_00]: Marguez for her and helping her do
labeling and really nice packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think just in the long term,
there's so many moving parts with the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do every day, whether it's like,
oh my God, the grain delivery is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we have managers in place,
there's still a lot of things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get from the farm to slaughter,
to process, to sales, to distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, I think it would make
more business sense to stay with the
[SPEAKER_00]: course and just really focus on the
animals that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad's the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, we can get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really think through all the
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start getting into beef, then we have
to get higher rails because the carcasses
[SPEAKER_00]: are bigger and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these little downstream
issues to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw a hand go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do butchering classes in the wintertime
as an alternative income stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we feel very passionately about
spreading the information about
[SPEAKER_00]: small-scale butchering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 25 people per class that we
do in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say two or three times
myself and Greensboro and Starr have tried
[SPEAKER_00]: and brought us in to do a whole chicken
breakdown class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be great because if
you cook with a whole chicken,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really the most cost-effective cut of
meat you're going to buy, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a way to work it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't really get people engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting thing, I'm going to go off
topic, but it's sort of related for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting part of my job the last
few years doing the wholesale,
[SPEAKER_00]: I handle a lot of the sales for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means sometimes going and doing
special events.
[SPEAKER_00]: With grocery stores that we work with,
basically the sample girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our deli ham, and here's our
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gave me the advantage point of really
watching how people shop and what their
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery habits are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole broad spectrum of how
everyone but just that middle of the bell
[SPEAKER_00]: curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are people doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are really going through
and picking off those grocery shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many cooking components.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of prepared food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to eat burgers or fries,
but it's like the pre-made chicken breast
[SPEAKER_00]: marinated with the green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as I think it would be great to
get people more engaged, and I think there
[SPEAKER_00]: has been a renaissance that way the last
10 years in working with whole muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: meats or doing different things,
the reality is I do find people tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: towards convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we track with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because A, I got to sell my meat,
meat payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, if that's how people want it,
if I can get them to make a choice between
[SPEAKER_00]: ours and a commodity, organic meat from
Argentina, which is what big grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: stores buy in, I'd love to find ways for
them to keep supporting small local farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have to start as a convenience
marinating chicken breast for people,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain how much how the carcass
balancing is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my slow time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have pigs I have to sell to
buy the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other farmers that depend on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never laid anybody off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, all right, we have a build up in
ham.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, OK, we're going to brine those
into old, real style hams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start the brines for the
Easter hams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that inventory over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a $2 off case sale there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's feature that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just really, OK, it's a little bit warm
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make shish kebabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just trying to move those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the meat Tetris game of like,
what am I doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a hand in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very broadly.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything we do, what's your favorite
tool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my favorite tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making a very dirty joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work at a meat shop, there's a lot
of references that I can't partake in as
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's my favorite tool?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Japanese handsaw that I get to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to say two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paring knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone laughs at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want a paring knife,
it's the littlest knife in the universe,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're self-taught butchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who learned has real knives and
stuff, I'm sure would laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the little paring knife, when I have
to break down a chicken, or even a big
[SPEAKER_00]: loin to get the prime rib off of it,
I just love having the control of that
[SPEAKER_00]: little knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone teases me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is that we discovered over
time that you could, because we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: real equipment in the back, which you saw
some pictures of and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes we have to do primal breaks
for customers who come in on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I have a Boston butt cut,
which is five or six pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too big for that customer, but it has a
bone in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a long time ago that a
traditional meat saw, they're really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Lowe's or Home Depot in the
saw section, you can get what's known as a
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese pull saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cheap, like 20 bucks,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like you're cutting on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has really small teeth, and we can
sanitize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my favorite cutting,
bone cutting tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays really sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a lot cheaper than the
butcher saws, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did I mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to give a little question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grew up on a farm in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I raised a bunch of ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that I still have issues
reconciling is the ethical environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns with raising meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering how you tackled those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, if you do have those
questions, or how you interact with your
[SPEAKER_03]: customers when they have those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I was here for undergrad,
and I probably attended some sort of event
[SPEAKER_00]: in this very room here, I was a vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was vegetarian for 17 years of my
life, and I was vegan for about three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is something that I think about a
lot, and actually has driven the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of colored my outlook on
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll back up by saying that I love and
honor anybody's dietary choices and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I particularly am a big fan of vegans
and vegetarians, too, because I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: how much thought they put into what
they're consuming and their impacts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of my personal journey,
I started eating meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 17 years, I had a pretty big health
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some endocrine disruption stuff from
eating too much soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a vegetarian when I was 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally had to kind of get away
from some protein alternatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: which led me to meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of where I was at,
the only choice I wanted was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I understood where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I used to order frozen buffalo
meat, because this was years ago before
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to a farmer's market as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aged myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I kind of got into this
work, and again, this is just my own
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, and everyone has to have
their own life journey about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I am now is that I'm OK with
where I am in my personal food cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons that we want to do
this work, and you've heard me say a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple times in our mission, which is to
make local pasture rates, sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: meats, as accessible as possible,
that if people choose to have a slice of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacon or a deli ham sandwich, which is the
most popular food year over year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York Times has a poll every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular food is a ham sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when they go to the grocery store or
they go to the deli, they'll see Hormel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or else they could pay a dollar or two
more and get something from a small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just want to put that choice out
there for people who are trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what they want to eat and what to
ingest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the simple answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many ways we can go with that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll touch a little bit on the
environmental and pretty anti-confignment
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and like manure lagoons and all
the damage they do to communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen personally, I don't know enough
about this stuff to really speak about
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and percentages and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've personally seen the
transformation on how our land has
[SPEAKER_00]: responded to having animals and livestock
work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if livestock is meant for
every piece of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that corn and soy production
is meant for every piece of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we have, that's the most time that
our piggies spend inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of the year, I think someone was
asking me how I feed them in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: time, is they are in huge, almost like
greenhouse hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little bit heavier insulation
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pigs don't really like the wind,
which you probably experienced with
[SPEAKER_00]: raising your animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our climate is so unfortunately
temperate now that winter isn't as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem as it used to be for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the winter time, my whole herd has
access to about 10 to 15 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really truly, the whole back of
the barn's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cruise around all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have access to these huge
comfy kind of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: For farrowing, we would never use a
farrowing crate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons we practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer's nick, we're not looking for
fast to market meats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for good mothering skills is
really the main thing that we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means throwing at least a litter
of eight, because I do have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: economically feasible and stay in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a mom who knows how to feed her
piglets and care for them without ruling
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We practice a Swedish farrowing system,
which I think is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built these plywood boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of go into the hoop house,
which is kind of tall, so we can all stand
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, in our main one, in each one
there are like eight boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put, there's like an opening and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put like little two by fours in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the moms all hang out together in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in there about three weeks before
they have their babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just get to kind of relax at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they want to have babies,
I'm sure you know this, they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go into a stall and just choose
a place to really nestle up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, we kind of pay attention
to them, make sure they're eating like
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of extra hay and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have their piglets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everyone, and in general,
it triggers everybody else to have their
[SPEAKER_00]: piglets once one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've experienced that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we help by putting some two by
fours up in front so the mom can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of her box and go get food and
water and actually have a break from the
[SPEAKER_00]: piglets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty exhausting to be fed on all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can always go back to their
piglets and kind of be with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that lasts for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the piglets get big enough they can
start jumping the two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when everyone starts to
integrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of hang out that way for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually about another six weeks,
six to eight weeks, and then we'll wean
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the moms are still on the side
and the piglets are on the other side so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can smell each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little graduation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them little graduations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've struggled with that over the years
because, again, as much as we try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it as idyllic and awesome as always,
we have to be able to understand our
[SPEAKER_00]: business to make sure we're making enough
to keep the lights on, the feed coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: for the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moms, we actually spray paint
usually on the side, like a number,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem to mind with their little
tattoos, a big one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have a spreadsheet going at
any given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have to name them ready ones,
ready to go, because she's red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from when we birth them,
we do practice ear notching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to do the tags for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would just get them muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would never let us near
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ear notching, we also castrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ear notching, we do it at a young age
and doesn't really seem to bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't bother them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really effective way for us to
understand how the animals are
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we do a mixed herd, it's really
important to understand if someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: really small, maybe he's sick and needs
extra care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we keep track of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I missed that part of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we run two or three boars at any
given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've never done AI or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, we're self-taught
farmers really to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we had noticed is that the boar
is much happier if he can go on a date
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever he wants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to segregate him from the
ladies, he doesn't like that very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we heap three boars, our little
stallions, and they get 12 new dates once
[SPEAKER_00]: a month, which makes them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find you can't just have one,
in our experience, one boar with 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want to all of a sudden
know that he's shooting blanks all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden, like his time is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have a couple different
boars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about,
a couple different boars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you keep your boars in with your moms,
too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of keeps them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it keeps everyone kind of calm,
doing like nature's working, how it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: an out nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine the boys are running around with
the girls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to mimic that whenever possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in our super idyllic days,
we would let the moms fare outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was beautiful and awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how hard it is to
then round up in 70 acres 12 piglets from
[SPEAKER_00]: an ornery mom who does not want you to
take her piglets away from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're growing animals how we
do, and for the time period, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced earlier, which is a little bit
under a year, you have to castrate them
[SPEAKER_00]: for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this is your meat herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sell their meat at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't castrate them and they reach
sexual maturation, which is only four
[SPEAKER_00]: months or something, the boys have such
heavy, like testosterone in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you process them, there's a really
good chance that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something called boar taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boar taint is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody experienced boar taint before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, it smells like pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just like the meat, you take it out
of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the fry pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it,
but it's just that you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you experienced boar taint before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I exaggerating?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to, in our experience,
you have to castrate those animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do it as painlessly and quickly as
possible, we try to catch them within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we had to stop farrowing out
in the middle of the woods, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: super cute, and stop chasing piglets
around like hours on my stomach,
[SPEAKER_00]: like chasing them through the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, at some point, you just can't do
it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I miss anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: No rush?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you grow but still feed the people
you want to stop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, OK, maybe you're not tempted to cut
corners here.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very fair and honest
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, I was thinking about that just
the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit hard having managers now
who I love and adore and appreciate their
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not like your baby,
they don't quite have the same level of
honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't quite have the same level of
pride and things or passion to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring that up in the context of our
retail room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great retail room manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has so many skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wish I could help form him more into
seeking out some smaller farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes he'll track towards like,
oh, it's just easier from regional access.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll bring me artichokes from Watertown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have somebody in Ithaca that'll,
you know, so sometimes he'll get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit off the beaten path for me,
I think, at a convenience where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I'll help you find an artichoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let me know if you're getting a
little bit stymied that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, I'm trying to,
when it's also not me, like, how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage my employees not to cut corners,
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: One corner that I cut this year,
which I'm really sad about, is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped using local garlic in my sausages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes me see we use organic,
pre-peeled, that I get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very shamed about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just, I don't, I make so much
meat now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like literally we were
cleaning 150 pounds a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have ever cleaned
a pound beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's gonna, we went back to our
mission statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're just, you know, talking
ourselves into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, we're trying to make the meat
sustainable and local.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're putting all these man hours
into cleaning garlic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's not what we're supposed to be
doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I regret the days that I would sit in
the basement and kind of crack my own
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of what we're doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do them anywhere from like April
or May through November.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will let people out there in the winter
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the thing that we're most
passionate about, which I haven't talked
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about, is our mob grazing and
pasture rotation work that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets me super excited and really
proud and generates a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come this time of the year,
it's a muddy, snowy mess with animals just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of trouncing around 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not really anything growing or
anything happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just kind of at a homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some things with NOFA in the
past in their Organic Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to just do scheduled tours
once a month at the farm this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had the energy or juice to do
it, but it's one of our initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll post those for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're just interested,
you can also email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only email contact on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it seems like we're big,
we're still that small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you reach out to me, and I can hook
you up with my farm manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys could find it out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just thank Heather.
Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
