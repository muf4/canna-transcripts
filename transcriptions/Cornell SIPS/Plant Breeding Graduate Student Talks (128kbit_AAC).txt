[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself Srikant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a second year PhD grad student in
plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Mueller Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I would like to explain the project
that I'm working on from past couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before diving into the project,
I would like to explain some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental concepts and essential to
build this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, what exactly is a database?
[SPEAKER_00]: So database is the system that is widely
used across the industry and academia for
[SPEAKER_00]: data storage, data retrieval, and data
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BreedBase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BreedBase is the relational database
system that is free and open source that
[SPEAKER_00]: our lab developers have been built over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They added a bunch of features based on
the plant breeding community's request.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, plant breeding communities,
they can easily upload their data into the
[SPEAKER_00]: BreedBase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using the analysis tools that our lab
developers have built, they can analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: their data and make data-driven decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the BreedBase instance,
our lab also involved in developing a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of crop databases, specifically for
the cassava, cassava base, musa,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for banana, and crop for ambase,
and sweet potato base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many other breed-based
instances used by companies, but I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: list them.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this, even in the past year,
I worked on repetitive measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you can say this as a time
series feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically where you have multiple
values for a given trade that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this feature was requested from UC
Davis breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And North Carolina State University
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we implemented that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this now, I have a very good
understanding of how BreedBase works and
[SPEAKER_00]: how the process of BreedBase actually is
implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this knowledge and experience,
I would like to take BreedBase to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: level, where I would like to integrate
artificial intelligence in the BreedBase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before actually diving into what AI
application we will be building for the
[SPEAKER_00]: BreedBase, I would like to give the brief
statistics about that cassava base.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in the previous slide,
the cassava base is one of the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: databases as we have so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of March 2025, we have almost 240 GB
of data in the cassava base, out of which
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 GB is phenotypic data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 118 GB is of genotypic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to time constraint, I will not go
to each component of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why this is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to time constraint, I cannot go
through each component.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would like to pinpoint and
mention that cassava base has been widely
[SPEAKER_00]: used across the world in almost 550
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this database is so much
complex, and it's a large database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often use a structured query
language, which is called SQL language,
[SPEAKER_00]: to communicate with the databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the observable trait in most
of the plant breeders or the community to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this in mind, we would like to
develop a chatbot for the BreedBase using
[SPEAKER_00]: LLMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I would like to show you the
backend of the workflow, how it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: after it has been implemented or deployed
in the production site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine you are a user, and you are
communicating with some AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone has used ChatGPT or
Googlebot, so they know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a user might ask, hey, how many trials
do I have so far in the IAEA breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, using the RAC technique that I
will describe in the next slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will extract the trial column names
and the table names from the database for
[SPEAKER_00]: this specific NL question that user asked
in the interface or in the chatbot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these both will be provided to the
fine-tuned LLM, and LLM will write SQL
[SPEAKER_00]: query, which means it's another word where
you use to communicate with the databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will eventually be executed on the
database, and that's where you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to showing the value that
we retrieved from the database,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would also like to show the generalized
statement along with the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, this would be clear and concise
information to the user, whoever is
[SPEAKER_00]: querying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course, it is true that there are
so many closed source LLMs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: outperforming in various tasks,
such as summarization, code generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot many other tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, recently, Stanford NLP group have
tested with the various closed source
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fine-tuned their LLMs using those
closed source API keys, and they found
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is ineffectiveness in updating
existing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is once they
fine-tuned their models using these closed
[SPEAKER_00]: source APIs, after that, they modified
their data in the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fine-tuned LLM couldn't be able to
retrieve the updated data, and there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide variety of reasons why this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the primary reason is closed source
LLMs doesn't have a flexibility of using
[SPEAKER_00]: different LLM techniques on the fine-tuned
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you cannot even improve the
model accuracy or performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this, I referred a couple of times
about the closed source LLMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily, those are developed from
OpenAI, and the Google, and the Cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the open source LLMs are Meta,
DeepSeq, and Microsoft.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are primarily deployed on the
hugging phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: From hugging phase, you can easily deploy
onto your local machine or the GPUs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this project, we will not be using
these closed source models.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we would be likely to use open
source LLMs to build this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned LLM strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the previous slide a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to mention about
retrieval argument generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it is a $5 word, and it's a simple
word, as a name it indicates, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: retrieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, if a user asks some question
in the NL interface, it retrieves the
[SPEAKER_00]: table names or the column names with
respect to the database to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a high level of coding that is
required to implement this technique for
[SPEAKER_00]: this objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next comes the supervised fine-tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supervised fine-tuning is time-consuming,
and it's an iterative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to build a training data set
in a way that it should include all the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge cases even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a high level of coding that is
also required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, last technique is reinforcement
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reinforcement learning is a branch of
ML that we actually basically train the AI
[SPEAKER_00]: agents based on the trial and error
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a high level of coding that is
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no straightforward mathematical
framework or a mathematical formula to
[SPEAKER_00]: directly deploy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to verify with the different
algorithms for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I would like to thank my PI for
giving me an exciting opportunity to work
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I would like to thank John for
giving me access to the GPUs to test it
[SPEAKER_00]: before trying to deploy these models on
the production side.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I would like to open the floor
to any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last slide, you listed a couple different
strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any one that you want to look at
going forward, or are you going to try all
[SPEAKER_03]: three maybe to see which one works best?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, in this slide that I'm
showing right now, she mentioned that I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed here different techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I use all of those, or do I use only
one among the three?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three techniques are very
important in order to make this objective
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot use only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three techniques are combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to combine to build this chatbot,
meaning all these three techniques are
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one technique is doing one job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to combine all these three
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're using the Casaba data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard would it be to then use another
data set for another problem, to translate
[SPEAKER_01]: this to another problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you have to rebuild and train the
model all over again, or would it be easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the model for a different
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question here in the audience is,
currently, I'm using the Casaba base for
[SPEAKER_00]: the integration initial stage to build
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, in the future, if I transfer
to the other crop or other databases,
[SPEAKER_00]: how easy or how hard is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the simple question is, for our
example, we have multiple crop databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Casaba base and most of the
databases, we have the same structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by structure, so the table
names, column names, all are same across
[SPEAKER_00]: the different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the values or some functionality
might change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we implement Casaba base,
and it's working fine as we expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in order to scale up to the other
databases, we need to change the table
[SPEAKER_00]: names and the column names in those
databases specifically to those crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so my name is Luis Muzarrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a four-year PhD student in Larry's lab
in Cornell AgriTech in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, I would like to do an updated
summary of my work on mapping QTL and
[SPEAKER_04]: identify candida genes for seed aeronomic
traits in hemp F2 populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to start off, I would like to,
for some of you that are not familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: this crop, there are three main market
classes in hemp, flour, fiber,
[SPEAKER_04]: and grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the flour, obviously, the end product
is the extraction of cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_04]: these flours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for all these market classes,
there are key traits to take into account
[SPEAKER_04]: when considering cultivars and when
breeding cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the flour, per se, the idea is to
increase the floral biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So flowering time is one important trait
to consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, cannabinoids as well,
which is not something that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: cover today.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the fiber, the idea is to harvest the
stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also want, based on the idea that
you can see here, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a tall, non-branchy, late flowering
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the important traits is
flowering time as well as biomass to
[SPEAKER_04]: ensure that we have this accumulation of
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fiber quality is another important
trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from this biomass that is accumulated,
we can remove this bast from the herd to
[SPEAKER_04]: maximize the bast production for textiles
or the hair production if the intent is
[SPEAKER_04]: for construction materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, we have the grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another market class that is embedded in
it is the dual purpose, which stands for
[SPEAKER_04]: production of the grain and the stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you harvest the fluorescence,
and then you harvest the stocks at the
[SPEAKER_04]: end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get the fiber and grain as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here, again, one of the key traits to
consider is flowering time, because we
[SPEAKER_04]: want to ensure that we accumulate biomass
so this crop reaches a sufficient height
[SPEAKER_04]: for an optimal harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it meets the goals, whether it's dual
purpose or grain only.
[SPEAKER_04]: And biomass as well, because we want to
have that balance between certain
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulation biomass for both fiber and
grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, I'm not going to forget
grain yield and seed quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the seed quality is another
important trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, we are considering quality
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the seed size as well as the protein
and oil content.
[SPEAKER_04]: But speaking of seed size, so here in this
picture, you can see the variation on seed
[SPEAKER_04]: size that we have in our genoplasm in
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from an important agronomic
standpoint, actually, seed size could be
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial for a stand establishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a consumer perspective, a larger seed
will be more appealing for a consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from a processing point of view,
we have observed that larger seeds may
[SPEAKER_04]: lead to a better processing of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So traditionally, hemp hearts that you
see, and you can access commercially,
[SPEAKER_04]: are seeds that are originated from
cultivars that are not that different from
[SPEAKER_04]: seed size that equates Bielo-Brzeski or
Feligna-32, as you see here, or perhaps
[SPEAKER_04]: even smaller than this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're interested in looking at the
processability of these larger seeds that
[SPEAKER_04]: you see on the left, as well as,
of course, the genetic mechanisms
[SPEAKER_04]: underlying that trait of the seed size
alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this hemp grain, which is no grain,
it's on the keen, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's harvested, it is processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here, you can get two main components
of these seeds, the hemp hearts,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are actually the collions of the
seeds, and the hemp holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hemp hearts are high in protein,
about 20% to 25% protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fat is about 25% to 35%, if I'm not
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the holes, which are the pericarp of
this akin, is high in dietary fiber,
[SPEAKER_04]: about 25% to 35% as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, the end product of these
components become into hemp seed meal,
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp seed oil, 45 foods like baked goods,
as well as plant-based meats and berries,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you can see here, I left it in this
graph.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with all of this in mind, I established
three objectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are to identify significant QTL
for seed size and agronomic traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: and to compare or determine the
consistency of this QTL between three
[SPEAKER_04]: populations that will represent each of
the market classes, and identify,
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully, the candidate genes within the
1.5-lod interval for each of these QTL.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to start off, in 2021, a high
cannabinoid F2 population was developed,
[SPEAKER_04]: crossing a paramilitary-resistant clonal
individual, F58, in TGCBD, clonal
[SPEAKER_04]: individual that is
paramilitary-susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea here, or the main goal of this,
was to characterize paramilitary
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance, I was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, other phenotypes were measured.
[SPEAKER_04]: For this, the crossing scheme was the
selfing of two selected F1s, generating
[SPEAKER_04]: two F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea of having more than one F2 is
so that, because hemp is highly
[SPEAKER_04]: heterozygous, having more than one F2
population increases our likelihood to
[SPEAKER_04]: capture the effect of the allele present
in the parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have 21,004 and 21,005,
with 366 and 304 individuals,
[SPEAKER_04]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another important thing to mention is that
the flowering time between these two
[SPEAKER_04]: parents is about a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they flower relatively, I wouldn't say
early, but not too late, either.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the gain population, in this case,
we employ a dual-purpose green line.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is 2011, 79.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or GBAH, 2011, 79, which is a late flower
individual, large seeded, and crossed with
[SPEAKER_04]: a picolo, which is a very popular Canadian
grain cultivar that has high protein
[SPEAKER_04]: content, that has small seed and early
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the crossing scheme was
developed through a seed mating of the
[SPEAKER_04]: F1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we ended up phenotyping only the
females, 198 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the fiber, in this case, we use the
fiber green line to GBAH.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very late flowering,
a very large seeded cultivar population.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crossed with the first New York
feral population isolated, which is Logan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very early and a very small
seeded cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, we also did seed mating for
the generation of the F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, we phenotype and genotype
females and males, having a total of 445
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the creation of the linkage maps,
we use two genotyping platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a high Canadian population,
21,004 and 21,005, we use an Illumina
[SPEAKER_04]: array developed by Phylos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, we ended up with linkage maps that
have 2,659 and 2,197 markers,
[SPEAKER_04]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas for the green FI population,
we use an Agilent SureSelect prop set that
[SPEAKER_04]: we developed in our lab, which we named
and select.
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually helped us develop a greater
linkage maps that have 748 markers for the
[SPEAKER_04]: grain and 122 markers for the fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all this in mind, on all these
methodologies, I decided to look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: seed size.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, we quantify that by the
weight of 1,000 seeds or 1,000 seed weight
[SPEAKER_04]: of TSW, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, in the high Canadian population,
21,004, we found 5 QTL that are associated
[SPEAKER_04]: with this trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see here, the largest peak is
located in chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: They explain a good proportion of the
variants in a very small region,
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively speaking, in the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see that the effect of the allele is
dominant over the B allele.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the A population, we also find a QTL
in chromosome 1, but conversely,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the only QTL that we find
explaining low proportion of the variants,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in a very large region.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the effect of the A allele
over the B allele seems to be additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the grain, we have four QTL
identified, and in this case, we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: observe this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll say that the largest peak is in
chromosome 9 instead, explaining a
[SPEAKER_04]: considerable percentage of the variants,
sorry, but a large region, and also seems
[SPEAKER_04]: to be additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the fiber, interestingly, we only find
two QTL, but a massive peak in chromosome
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 that explains over 60% of the variants
in our population.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, the region is quite
large, it's 9.1 megabases, and here,
[SPEAKER_04]: the additive effect, sorry, the effect of
the B allele over the A allele is
[SPEAKER_04]: additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for the flowering time, in this case,
for 21,004 in the high kind of population,
[SPEAKER_04]: we find one large peak in chromosome 1,
again, compared to the 14,000 C weight,
[SPEAKER_04]: that explains also a good proportion of
the variants in this small region.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect of this allele is, again,
dominant, as you compared to the one
[SPEAKER_04]: identified in the 1000 C weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: For 21,005, we also observe another peak,
well, two peaks, actually, but the largest
[SPEAKER_04]: peak in chromosome 1, explaining 20% of
the variants in a large, over 20% in a
[SPEAKER_04]: large region, and in this case,
the effect is additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the grain, we only find one peak in
chromosome 1 that explains over half
[SPEAKER_04]: percent of the variants, and in this case,
this allele seems to be additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the fiber, we observe the most QT
identified for flowering time,
[SPEAKER_04]: four, one, two, five, actually,
to be precise, but again, the most,
[SPEAKER_04]: the largest peak is in chromosome 1 with
an additive effect, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't explain that much of the
variant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here is highlights the
importance of this chromosome 1 or the
[SPEAKER_04]: presence of flowering time genes in this
chromosome 1 in the cannabis genome,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least for a genome that we're
evaluating here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, for biomass, which I would
expect that it would coincide with the
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering time, and for this family,
it does, explaining proportional variants,
[SPEAKER_04]: same with the regenerative region,
but again, this is an additive allele
[SPEAKER_04]: compared to the B allele.
[SPEAKER_04]: For high cannabinoid, 2005, again,
there's a peak here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are not many that explain much of
the variants, but it's still there,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm seeing the same thing in grain,
the largest peak, or the only peak,
[SPEAKER_04]: peak in chromosome 1 equates to the one in
the flowering time, explaining good
[SPEAKER_04]: proportion of the variants, but a large
region.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the fiber, however, we don't
observe that peak in chromosome 1 that
[SPEAKER_04]: should coincide with flowering time,
but instead is only in chromosome 6,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is very interesting for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it doesn't explain that much of
the variants, but it's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so with that, the key takeaways
are that the chromosomal location for the
[SPEAKER_04]: largest effect QTL for seed size measures
1,000 seed weight differs depending on the
[SPEAKER_04]: location on the population that we use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest effect of this QTL for
flowering time in all population was
[SPEAKER_04]: located in chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest effect QTL for biomass seems
to coincide with that for flowering in all
[SPEAKER_04]: populations except the one in fiber,
which is in chromosome 6.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing, I don't know if you caught
it, but there seems to be a one
[SPEAKER_04]: pleiotropic dominant effect QTL in
chromosome 1 for this high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: population in 2001, 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I would like to thank all
the members of Larry Smart Lab,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as my founding sources listed
here, and I will welcome any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: A range of planting densities for hemp,
like super dense for fiber, super sparse
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you pick the density or the
densities used for this study?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that have like a complex,
I mean, does that impact flowering time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And total seed weight differently like in
the fiber biparentals versus like the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid or grain biparentals?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the question is how I decided the
plant intensity and if that affects the
[SPEAKER_04]: traits phenotype here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant density was wide spacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, one trait that will
ultimately be affected by a plant density
[SPEAKER_04]: is yield for biomass as well as seed yield
that's definitely affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flowering time, however, does not seem to
be affected by the plant intensity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the seed size does not seem to be
affected either as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was wondering, you have a lot of QTL
on chromosome 1 and it might be due to the
[SPEAKER_03]: pleiotropic effects from that one parent
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you looked further into those QTL to
see if it's like one major, one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: major genes that seem to be controlling
this effect or other QTL in like very
[SPEAKER_03]: different locations on that chromosome?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I like you, Emily.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did not have the time to incorporate
this in the presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was hoping somebody would ask that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have the actual sequence of the
parents in this high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were able to have, what is that
called, the structural and functional
[SPEAKER_04]: predictions of the genes located.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I was able is to section the
regions of that specific QTL and compare
[SPEAKER_04]: them with each other and see what differs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one that I identify as the one
differing is this LUC7-like protein in
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is this gene insertion that
causes a frame shift mutation in this
[SPEAKER_04]: haplotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: This LUC7-like protein is a homolog to a
LUC7RL in the Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this seems to participate as an
accessory protein to the U1 small nuclear
[SPEAKER_04]: ribosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an adenyl protein in the
spliceosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's affected or affects the RNA
maturation of several genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a group in Germany actually validated
this by knocking it out and testing what
[SPEAKER_04]: is upregulated or unregulated and what
several outcomes that they got from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: which highlights a pleiotropic effect in
the Arabidopsis organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
