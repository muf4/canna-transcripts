[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for accommodating me to
participate virtually and to wrap up this
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like a very rapid fire session lots
of a lot of information happening really
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk very quickly and
hopefully stay on time about the Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Leadership and Community Protection Act
and what the state is doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick, very quick overview,
because I know we don't have a ton of time
[SPEAKER_00]: on the climate leadership and Community
Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was passed in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a veteran law nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It set us up for emissions reductions
requirements, 85 percent below 1990 levels
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2050 with an interim target of 40
percent by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of clean energy and
energy efficiency requirements that are
[SPEAKER_00]: now part of that law that we are marching
steadily towards achieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also very strong requirements
around climate justice and just transition
[SPEAKER_00]: included in that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Climate Act requires New York State to
look at our emissions differently than
[SPEAKER_00]: other jurisdictions or how we had even
done it in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires us to look at the upstream out
of state emissions related to fossil fuels
[SPEAKER_00]: that come into our state and are combusted
for end uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also requires us to use a 20 year
global warming potential versus a 100 year
[SPEAKER_00]: global warming potential, which is all how
different gases persist in the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to carbon dioxide, which is
typically the benchmark greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of all of this was a bit of a
shift in terms of the magnitude each
[SPEAKER_00]: sector contributes to our statewide
emissions with buildings and
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation taking up more than half
and our electricity sector being what was
[SPEAKER_00]: a relatively smaller contributor in terms
of percentage and our waste sector being a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger percentage, which is mostly related
to the use of methane, use of natural gas
[SPEAKER_00]: or methane from landfills and the global
warming potential of methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also see these bar charts showing
the aggressive step down that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize in order to achieve the
requirements of the act where we were in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990 of where we are in 2021, which is our
most recent year of data and where we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be 2030 and 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Climate Act put the created a Climate
Act action council whose job it was to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a plan on how we're going to
achieve those emissions reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the council worked for two years on a
draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draft was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went out for public comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got thousands and thousands and
thousands of comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also a large analytical body of
work was undertaken to look at the costs
[SPEAKER_00]: and benefits of the actions within the
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plan was finalized at the end of
2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every five years we have to refresh
that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are in deep in the
implementation section.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the larger components of the
scoping plan was a recommendation that New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State go forth with a cap and invest
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a large economy wide program
that sets emissions reductions targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the requirements, and also brings in
revenue in order to reinvest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy and emissions reductions
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Governor Hokel off the bat recommended
in 2023 state to state that the agencies
[SPEAKER_00]: get to work on developing this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, in 2024, again,
when the state budget advanced a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of how the proceeds, we would
structure the sale of the investment of
[SPEAKER_00]: the proceeds from the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very briefly, how the cap and invest
program works is there is an annual limit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the amount of greenhouse gases
statewide that can be emitted it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: sector specific cap, but it's a statewide
blanket cap for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse gas emissions sources or
sources of fuel for heating or for
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation are required to obtain
allowances at auction for the emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with their activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those auctions, the proceeds from those
allowances are then reinvested into the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy, into technologies that reduce
emissions to minimize costs and supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: this great transition that the state is
undertaking in terms of building
[SPEAKER_00]: decarbonization and electric sector
decarbonization and transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: decarbonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the program is prioritizes frontline
disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate act all throughout has a large
focus on ensuring that the transition to a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean energy economy and the reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions prioritizes
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor also set forth principles
that guide the development of this cap and
[SPEAKER_00]: invest program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agencies are structured within these
principles of affordability, ensuring that
[SPEAKER_00]: this program is affordable for New
Yorkers, that we are demonstrating climate
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership regionally, nationally,
that it creates jobs and preserves
[SPEAKER_00]: competitiveness of the New York state
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that the prioritization of
investment and disadvantaged communities
[SPEAKER_00]: is always front and center and that these
funds are being invested in a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: future for the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, as I mentioned, this process has
been in place, the development of these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a small undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a large program to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been a transparent and
public process over the past year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half, two years on the development of the
draft regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kicked off a process of putting out
to the public, what has been done in other
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, California and Washington
and the province of Quebec have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in place, looking at what they
have done, what works in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: what doesn't work in New York and
receiving all this feedback, having
[SPEAKER_00]: technical webinars to gain insight,
conducting learning sessions, putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: some preliminary analytical work to help
ground some of the discussion,
[SPEAKER_00]: having direct roundtable discussions with
equity stakeholders and labor stakeholders
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of that has been going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a public intake process
to receive input, to help crack those
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations in a way that's gonna work
well for New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in the 2024 state budget,
the governor set forth the structure for
[SPEAKER_00]: the investment, where the proceeds will be
directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high level breakdown where there's,
that budget, created what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer climate action account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30% of proceeds from those options of
allowances will go directly back to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Yorkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll flow through the climate action
account and they'll go back to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Yorkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also was the direction to proceed with
an affordability study whose outcome was
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what's the best mechanism by which
to deliver those proceeds back to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Yorkers to help reduce their costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also an industrial small
business climate action account that was
[SPEAKER_00]: set aside 3% of future proceeds to
mitigate costs for that sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the remaining goes into a climate
investment account, which supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a large portion of the funding
that goes into all sorts of clean energy
[SPEAKER_00]: program, clean transportation,
community support, a large variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some highlighted projected effects of
the New York cap and invest program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at currently enacted
policies, there's a lot of modeling going
[SPEAKER_00]: on to understand what are the costs,
what are the benefits of the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the right costs triggers in order
to see certain emissions reductions,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a high body of analytical work out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see that this program
accelerates our progress towards meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: our emission limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will achieve pretty significant
greenhouse gas emissions reductions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also going to need a lot of
other current and new programs to
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment the cap and invest program
because our emissions reductions
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements state of New York are very,
very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
improved air quality, there's health
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits that are outcomes of those that
are benefits for all regions of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they tend to provide greater benefits
in disadvantaged communities that have
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally been more burdened by poor
air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program is expected to generate
large volumes of money to support the
[SPEAKER_00]: clean energy transition and to support
program affordability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because we have a lot
of very, there's a lot that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a recent discussion around
heat pumps in manufactured homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to achieve building
decarbonization, there's going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of heat pumps installed in lots
of homes across the state of New York to
[SPEAKER_00]: transition us off of fossil fuels for home
heating and cooling for the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the affordability benefit payment
along with these investments are modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: to really manage household costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really directed towards
managing greater costs for low income
[SPEAKER_00]: households.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low income households will be under the
modeling scenarios better off under a cap
[SPEAKER_00]: and invest program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, the equity
considerations are a huge part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Act and New York's work in
greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Climate Act requires that the
Department of Environmental Conservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess I never took a second to
introduce myself, but I'm Maureen Letty,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Director of the Office of Climate
Change at the Department of Environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservation, that everything that we do
in terms of regulations to implement the
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Act do not result in an increase
in co-polluting emissions or
[SPEAKER_00]: disproportionately burdened disadvantaged
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires that our actions prioritize
reductions in disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like every state agency and authority
and so on, at least 35% with a goal of 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: of our investment will directly benefit
disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, there's been a lot of
information shared publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all on the cap and invest website.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pre-proposal outline created a lot of
points to consider in terms of how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: address impacts and disadvantaged
communities either within or complementary
[SPEAKER_00]: to the New York cap and invest program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NICU does not allow offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of other cap and invest programs
allow obligated entities to comply by
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing offsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as proposed under our current
public information, not to be a component
[SPEAKER_00]: of the program for cap and invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important consideration for
equity stakeholders because they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see those reductions happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to see offsets happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quick snapshot timeline of where
we are in this large process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top bar blue is the regulation
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three regulations that make up the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a greenhouse gas reporting rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we get the information on how
much emissions is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is the cap and invest rule,
which sets the cap and how the cap
[SPEAKER_00]: declines over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sets who is an obligated entity and
lots of other considerations around the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and function of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third rule is the auction rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sets out the framework and the
procedures under which the auctions of
[SPEAKER_00]: allowances occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have put out a lot of initial
information and have been receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from the public and stakeholders
for a really long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in this right at the cusp of being
ready to issue the regulatory proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very hopeful that will happen
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will kick off a formal
comment period and hearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we anticipate there being a lot of
interest and a lot of feedback and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of comment received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the coming months and years on how
the program should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we issue final regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reporting program begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data intake occurs and compliance
begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green, we have the timeline for the
work around investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a draft framework for the
investments posted publicly, also on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cap and invest website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're receiving public input.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be clear, agencies are not in charge of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in charge of deciding where the
investments go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all be decided through the
legislative and budget process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do want to have a framework and a
decision point that's informed by public
[SPEAKER_00]: information, by public feedback on what
are the investments that are important to
[SPEAKER_00]: New Yorkers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much should go to transportation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much should go to buildings in large
share like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that information is also available
in comments as being accepted on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our intention is to develop an
investment proposal that we submit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: governor so that she can incorporate that
into her 2025 budget process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I mentioned, then this all goes
on to negotiation with the legislature as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of finalizing the state budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we want to set forward a
long-term planning horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nikki investments have some certainty
over a rolling five-year whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-year planning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a runway for us to work within.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, the cap and invest
program is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large part of what the state is
doing, but there's also a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: policies and regulations underneath that
large umbrella program that are all
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary and important to helping us
achieve the emissions reductions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Leadership and Community
Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is my last slide here with all
the websites and email addresses and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find all this great
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really big program, but we have
posted everything that we have that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available up on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the comments that have
been received.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all available publicly on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to provide feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an online form at capandinvest.ny
.gov where you can submit your feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: electronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email this email address or you
can send it to the regular U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Postal Service Mail to DEC's Air Quality
Planning Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I think maybe I'm in good on
time and I'll pass the mic back to Jenny,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Maureen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is, does anybody have any
questions for Maureen before we lose her?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your biggest hope for Cap and
Invest for facilitating both greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: gas mitigation and equity at the same
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're just, we want to ensure,
we feel like there's a lot, a good body of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that demonstrates that the
emissions reductions benefit the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: state of New York, but they are definitely
higher in disadvantaged communities but we
[SPEAKER_00]: also hear from disadvantaged communities
the desire for a lot of certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really want to know this is going to
happen and modeling is modeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of other parallel work
that we are not losing sight of to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that those reductions will happen in those
communities and that they will realize
[SPEAKER_00]: those benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have other requirements under
the law that moderate our permitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just DEC but all agencies,
are any administrative decisions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: required to consider disadvantaged
communities, to put those front and
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all sorts of other mechanisms
in place that we want to use as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, complimentary to Nikki,
to make sure that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you for the huge,
huge, huge amount of work throughout this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of amazing what you all
are convening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody go to the Energy Expo
tomorrow and see these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: these materials firsthand and I will also
just say I would really like to say thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: to Josh, John, Ken and Gabriel who've been
this massive team of people working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy Expo and this panel and also thank
you to Danielle with your work on
[SPEAKER_01]: Manufactured Housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, we are done with this session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
