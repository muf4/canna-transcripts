[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real honor to be here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was a graduate student,
I was very much aware of the group led by
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed Lemon here, Bob Musgrave, doing
photosynthesis research, sort of moving
[SPEAKER_03]: from the laboratory reductionist approach
to photosynthesis out into the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this iconic paper,
Sun's Work, and it's a cornfield that was
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 1965, something like that,
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been interested in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never visited here before,
so it's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's good to experience the legendary
winter in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very lucky to get here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with Yang's help, we made it and made
this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm interested, as Yang says,
in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm trying to do is to patch
together ways to model and measure
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis at large scales while not
forgetting the mechanisms that underlie
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to make the connections,
the long-term goal is really to come up
[SPEAKER_03]: with a way of monitoring photosynthesis to
understand what controls it, and
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly to see whether things like
climate change are changing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: land use change, how are we doing in
agriculture, and things like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Photosynthesis is really the primary
driver of all these productivity
[SPEAKER_03]: processes, and then, of course,
is linked, as Yang mentioned, to
[SPEAKER_03]: transpiration and to the hydrologic cycle
and actually to weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a lot of fun keeping
photosynthesis, trying to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis in the middle of all this
stuff, and working with things like Earth
[SPEAKER_03]: system models.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll talk mostly today about
chlorophyll fluorescence, which Yang is
[SPEAKER_03]: really the expert on, and a little bit
about ways that we're trying to build on
[SPEAKER_03]: what we learned from chlorophyll
fluorescence to understand the standard
[SPEAKER_03]: multispectral approaches that have been
used by the satellites that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: around since the 1980s to see if we can
improve the way that they do
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start by, so that I don't forget,
these are the folks in the lab who are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing most of the work, and this is
Grayson Badgley, who's done recently work
[SPEAKER_03]: on reflectance, linking reflectance
measurements to the solar-induced
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yalu is a modeler, radiation transport
modeler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari is doing the doing measurements,
sort of lab measurements, working out the
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques for measuring fluorescence from
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen is a modeler, working with me on
extending the models that we've made of
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lee is doing work on, he's a great
statistician, and he's working with us on
[SPEAKER_03]: putting this together to try and do global
simulations Yoichi is doing geostatistics,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to show how solar-induced
fluorescence works as a variable driving
[SPEAKER_03]: or correlating with gross primary
productivity, trying to approach it from
[SPEAKER_03]: the data as opposed to the modeling
approach, and this is Young-Ril Ryu,
[SPEAKER_03]: who is a sabbatic visitor from Seoul,
Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do most of the work, so I want to
make sure they have credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: To start out with, I thought I'd talk a
little bit about photosynthesis and the
[SPEAKER_03]: way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's driven by the sun, of course,
but I think it's useful to think about,
[SPEAKER_03]: really, how's it linked up?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think of it, the radiations coming
from the sun really comes from the
[SPEAKER_03]: collision of mostly hydrogen atoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the solar atmosphere, right at the
top, and when two molecules or two atoms
[SPEAKER_03]: like this collide, there's a really rapid
change in velocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that happens, electrons jump around,
and a good deal of most of the energy of
[SPEAKER_03]: that collision gets transferred into the
emission of electromagnetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average energy of those is coupled to
the temperature of the sun, which is about
[SPEAKER_03]: 6,000 K.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the mechanism that the energy
produced by the thermonuclear reactions
[SPEAKER_03]: down in the center get released at the
surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just black-body radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every photon that comes out is really
related to the collision of atoms on the
[SPEAKER_03]: sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those photons get to Earth,
and some fairly large fraction of them
[SPEAKER_03]: actually wind up getting absorbed by
chlorophyll, if they're in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's eight minutes from the sun to the
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: The electron is promoted to a higher
energy orbital in the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_03]: molecule, and basically, it has the energy
of this collision that happened just
[SPEAKER_03]: shortly ago, and in relative listing
terms, simultaneously on the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, a part of that molecule is at
6,000 K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it is unstable, in this
configuration, but it has trapped,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least momentarily, the energy of an
event that occurred on the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it's done is essentially promoted
that electron on chlorophyll molecule to a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher state.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the blue absorption of
chlorophyll degrades to the red first
[SPEAKER_03]: excited state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can decay or move to other energy,
decay by fluorescence or photochemistry or
[SPEAKER_03]: other pathways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what I'm going to use phi for
is a fluorescence or a yield, and the
[SPEAKER_03]: yield of all the processes that can be
involved in the de-excitation of that
[SPEAKER_03]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Packet of energy adds up to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of structural biology,
this is a symbolic diagram of a
[SPEAKER_03]: photosystem two reaction center and henna
complex, where the two reaction centers
[SPEAKER_03]: here in the center, and these are light
harvesting chlorophyll proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which are the ones that are most likely to
capture that energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The energy is captured and moves from
chlorophyll molecule to chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_03]: molecule, and ultimately comes to the
reaction center, or something else happens
[SPEAKER_03]: to it, but it comes to the reaction
center.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a charge separation that occurs,
and the energy is captured in electronic
[SPEAKER_03]: state as opposed to electromagnetic state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just diagrammatically, it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The energy comes in, and the real
transformative element in this is two
[SPEAKER_03]: chlorophyll molecules that are really
oppressed close to one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're farther apart, they can
transfer energy as electromagnetic energy
[SPEAKER_03]: from one to another, but when they're
really close together, they can interact
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way that where an electron moves from
one excited chlorophyll to one chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_03]: to the other, so it's a charge separation.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that charge separation occurs,
an electron can be provided for water to
[SPEAKER_03]: quench the one that's become positive,
and the one that has the electron on it
[SPEAKER_03]: can move that electron over to a quinone,
and ultimately to a mobile electron
[SPEAKER_03]: transport carrier, which diffuses away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The essence of this is that what started
out as an electromagnetic excitation winds
[SPEAKER_03]: up causing an electronic charge
separation, which is kind of a redox
[SPEAKER_03]: reaction, and the energy of that is
essentially stored in the product here,
[SPEAKER_03]: a reduced diffusable chemical entity.
[SPEAKER_03]: What started in the sun with a collision
winds up out here in eight minutes and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe a few hundred picoseconds as a
stable chemical entity, which has enough
[SPEAKER_03]: energy associated with it to fix carbon
dioxide and power the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really fundamentally different
than what we do with a silicon photocell.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a photocell, the photoelectric effect
in silicon causes charge separations,
[SPEAKER_03]: and these migrate to electrodes and
current flows, which we can sort of kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of store that in a battery, and we can
drive around on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to look at what's happening with
photosynthesis very much in the same way
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're using solar energy to generate
or charge a chemical battery.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can then use what's in that battery,
which is in the form of reduced carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds and oxygen, metabolically to go
for a run, or industrially to burn fossil
[SPEAKER_03]: fuels to generate electricity or power
cars or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that really goes back to
charging this large battery, which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: biosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one of the best indicators of
this is the oxygen in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes about 1,500 years for half of the
oxygen to be processed by redox reactions
[SPEAKER_03]: that are associated with this battery
turning over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it's pretty active.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of tend to think of oxygen as
being stable and always there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in timeframes of, say, between the
last ice age and now, the atmosphere is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably all new oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of why I'm fascinated with
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ying mentioned the stuff that we did a
long time ago in 1980.
[SPEAKER_03]: or so on photosynthesis modeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a picture that I just was at a
symposium with.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Graham Farquhar, Susanna van
Kammerer, and me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a paper that Graham actually got
the Kyoto Prize in part for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I'd just throw that out
because we were all in our 30s or 20s at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time that was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of funny to think that stuff
you're doing as a postdoc, actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: something sticks and something happens as
a result of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no idea that this was going to be
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we had entirely different goals
for doing the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was rejected three times,
but it's turned out to be reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was published in Planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most cited paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan is published, but it took us,
I think, three years to get it accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an aside, the whole idea of it is to
deal with this problem that photochemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: is coming in at whatever rate the light
comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the potential for photochemistry is
entirely dependent on clouds and solar
[SPEAKER_03]: angle and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And leaves in between your particular
chloroplast and the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the energy is going to be stored
ultimately in dark reactions, which result
[SPEAKER_03]: in CO2 fixation and synthesis of sugars,
which is dependent upon the availability
[SPEAKER_03]: of CO2 linked to the availability of
water, temperature, and the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients that the plant has to make
enzymes with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has an entirely different drummer
than this, but there's no place to put
[SPEAKER_03]: excess photochemical products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to have a way to make this
system stay balanced so that the rate at
[SPEAKER_03]: which this occurs and this occurs are
balanced because there's very little
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity for storage in between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the very simple idea that led
to this paper, that the rate of
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis is the minimum of the
capacity of either one of these reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the work we're doing right
now really focuses back to, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: how does this actually fit together?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the mechanism that allows this one
to go at its maximum capacity until it
[SPEAKER_03]: reaches this one, and then this one to go
at its capacity while this one feeds it
[SPEAKER_03]: without large losses between the two?
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry for the scribbly slide here,
but the idea we're working on right now
[SPEAKER_03]: with Jen Johnson is that the real
regulation of this is a cytochrome complex
[SPEAKER_03]: that sits between photosystem I and
photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_03]: Photosystem II is the one that generates
oxygen, produces an electron, which moves
[SPEAKER_03]: to the cytochrome and then moves on to
photosystem I, which lifts it up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: level where it can react in carbon
fixation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing is that when this
system becomes light saturated,
[SPEAKER_03]: this reaction center becomes more reduced
and this reaction center becomes more
[SPEAKER_03]: oxidized.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think that both of them would become
more reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that it doesn't work that
way is that this is kind of a ratchet or a
[SPEAKER_03]: regulator that occurs right in between and
that there is very strong regulation at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point, which prevents if,
for example, you apply a too bright a
[SPEAKER_03]: light for photosynthesis, it prevents this
one from becoming too reduced and
[SPEAKER_03]: producing really strong reactive reduced
substrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just kind of keeps the voltage
across this whole system more or less
[SPEAKER_03]: constant while still allowing things to
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a conductor in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess I tell you this because we
keep working on things like this while
[SPEAKER_03]: we're working on large scale
photosynthesis studies because they keep
[SPEAKER_03]: exposing things that we didn't understand
about the photosynthetic mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fun to go back and play with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons that we got very
interested in photosynthesis was related
[SPEAKER_03]: to this yield here or fluorescence,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the yield of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fractional yield of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fairly small component,
but it's maybe 1% to 5% of all the photons
[SPEAKER_03]: that come in are re-emitted as
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing is that that's a
function of the molecule itself before it
[SPEAKER_03]: builds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when it's excited, it has half
time or a half life, just like a
[SPEAKER_03]: radioactive half life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to decay just as a function of
the time that the excited state exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tells you something about all the
rest of these things that are going on or
[SPEAKER_03]: at least the sum of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If these didn't exist, then the lifetime
of fluorescence would be very long and you
[SPEAKER_03]: would approach a yield of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives you kind of an internal clock
to understand how photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_03]: processing the photons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to interrupt, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fluorescence is also something that we
can measure outside of the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can then see what's going on in a
leaf by just looking at the fluorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: that's coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been used for 50 years or more to
look at photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the really nice things,
nice approaches for looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis, particularly in laboratory
situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that I wanted to point out
here is that some of these are passive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, there's kind of a wastage term
and fluorescence, which have to do simply
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some of them are dynamic that are
essentially physiologically controlled and
[SPEAKER_03]: vary with the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can see how these dynamic components
are behaving by following fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those dynamic components are
photochemistry itself and are regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: step or regulated competing reaction we
call non-photochemical quenching,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is actually kind of like stonemates
for light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It regulates the amount of light that
comes through from the pigment system to
[SPEAKER_03]: the reaction centers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in essence, that problem of how the
light reactions are down-regulated starts
[SPEAKER_03]: before the photons even get to the
reaction center.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quenched by this non-photochemical
quenching mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much to go into this?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can measure fluorescence and we can
measure photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gas exchange cuvette or system
which can measure the CO2 and water vapor
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also has the capability of
measuring fluorescence changes in response
[SPEAKER_03]: to changing the light environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can calculate the yield of
photochemistry in this system by saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that, well, there's four electrons
required for every CO2 that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: or four photons required for every CO2
that's fixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a, we can measure the CO2
exchange, add to it the dark respiration
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going on, correct for the
photorespiratory effect and divide by the
[SPEAKER_03]: total number of quanta.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gets you the, this is the number
of electrons that are transported to
[SPEAKER_03]: account for the photosynthetic rate that's
measured.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the number of photons that are
absorbed by that system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gives you the apparent quantum
yield or photochemical yield of that
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the fluorescence, by looking at the
change in fluorescence you get by applying
[SPEAKER_03]: an intense light, you can get an estimate
directly of the photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes about by making the assumption
that when you apply an intense light,
[SPEAKER_03]: you essentially reduce all the reaction
centers so that there are no
[SPEAKER_03]: photochemistry stops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fluorescence is going to increase
because photochemistry is stopped.
[SPEAKER_03]: These measurements are actually
measurements of the yield, not the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual amount of fluorescence goes way
up when you hit it with a bright light.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you use a special technique,
which uses a modulated fluorescent light,
[SPEAKER_03]: a modulated light to site fluorescence,
and then you look at only the modulated
[SPEAKER_03]: component of fluorescence, you see that
yield effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here the ratio, the amount of
fluorescence increase, that is this
[SPEAKER_03]: variable fluorescence that occurs relative
to the total modulation, the total
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence that occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the dark, this is the fluorescence
that occurs in a steady state.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you get in a bright light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That ratio is actually the photochemistry,
the efficiency of photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are ways you can go through and
prove that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing is that if you turn
the light on, allow the system to
[SPEAKER_03]: equilibrate, and then redo this bright
light, you don't get near as much
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this ratio is much lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because the photochemical yield
has decreased because the system is
[SPEAKER_03]: responding to the increased light that you
applied to the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's downregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other interesting thing about that is
if you look at it from fluorescence or
[SPEAKER_03]: from CO2 exchange, and you just take a
bunch of points and calculate the yield of
[SPEAKER_03]: photochemistry from the two approaches,
they agree pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives you a pretty strong indication
that, hey, you can measure photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_03]: either by looking at the way the photons
are processed, or by looking at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: result of that processing CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll just skip over this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main point of this is that there's,
photosynthesis has a whole series of
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory processes that drive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are very quick, some of them
take long periods of time, and it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of very much like a current regulating IC,
responding to things that are happening
[SPEAKER_03]: downstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned, there's this light,
stomata for light, that is
[SPEAKER_03]: non-photochemical quenching, and this
would be the rate constant for that
[SPEAKER_03]: non-photochemical process, and this the
rate constant for the photochemical
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these data on this side are derived
from this experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, this normal graph here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the rate of CO2 uptake,
and this is the concentration of CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as you increase the CO2,
it goes up and up to a fairly high rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it saturates at CO2 saturation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, you can actually improve this rate
by giving it more light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's limited by the capacity of the
CO2-fixing enzyme, which is CO2 dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out here at a high rate, this is the
rate of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this point and this point, this here
and this here, correspond to one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rate constant for photochemistry is
really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rate constant for non-photochemical
quenching is really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as this begins to go down in
photosynthetic rate, this
[SPEAKER_03]: non-photochemical quenching turns on,
and it corresponds to fairly stable region
[SPEAKER_03]: where the photochemical rate constant
stays the same or about the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the system is responding in such a way
that the light coming in or the photons
[SPEAKER_03]: getting into the reaction centers,
they're being reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rate constant for the chemistry is
staying about the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that system saturates ultimately,
and the rate constant for the chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: also drops as the reaction centers close.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to give you an idea how that
teeter totter kind of thing that I
[SPEAKER_03]: illustrated to begin with works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of power in you doing
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess the main thing that I point
out here is that this PAM fluorometry,
[SPEAKER_03]: the approach that we're using to make all
these inferences about the way photons
[SPEAKER_03]: process requires that we manipulate the
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not on if we're looking at the
planet or even a field.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we get out into the field, that's just
not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had this great method, but we were
very frustrated with the idea that,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, we're never going to really apply
this in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did some things like put together laser
excitation systems to try and pull this
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you actually can't make a laser that
is in the visible range that's any
[SPEAKER_03]: brighter than a pointer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, if you actually went back and
tried to license with the laser licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations one of these pointers,
you probably have to reduce most of their
[SPEAKER_03]: outputs considerably.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are kind of grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not much we can do to go out in
the field and provide bright light to
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd more or less given up that it
couldn't be used for regional or global
[SPEAKER_03]: scales, even though it's such a powerful
technique to look at photosynthesis with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that all changed in about 2010 for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking around a meeting,
the poster session of a meeting kind of at
[SPEAKER_03]: the close of the meeting, looking at
posters that had nothing to do with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I stumbled on this poster that said,
hey, we can measure fluorescence for
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote down the name and got on the
phone the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned out that it wasn't actually such
a new deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been measured before.
[SPEAKER_03]: The technique was originally worked out in
the 70s using very narrow filters to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at the light that comes off of vegetated
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had actually been measured with a
reflectance satellite.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that's kind of
interesting about this comparison here,
[SPEAKER_03]: these are crop circles, irrigated patches
in the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see these are in RGB color,
and these are in fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no light coming off the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light that's coming here is the light
that's coming from chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that bedevils remote
sensing in general by reflectance is that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not a lot of light reflected by
the uninteresting part of the land
[SPEAKER_03]: surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really messes things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here you can see that, forget it,
you don't see it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just look at that,
you'd see the plants much more
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the punchline from these two
papers that simultaneously figured out how
[SPEAKER_03]: to acquire the fluorescence from
satellites that were originally designed
[SPEAKER_03]: to measure the concentration of gas in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a year's fluorescence
measurements showing that areas like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon and Indonesia and tropical Africa
have the highest rates of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things more or less follow the
patterns that we expect for
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though we couldn't measure,
do any experiments on manipulating the
[SPEAKER_03]: light, it looked like this is coming out
that's looking kind of like we hoped
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence would look anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a graph from a recent paper
that Ying is the senior author on,
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at fluorescence from a satellite
that was originally put in orbit to
[SPEAKER_03]: measure carbon dioxide concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And flux measured at CO2 flux towers
simultaneously with the fluorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_03]: They agree pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is pulling it down to a smaller
scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other was really based on what we
expected for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really based on observations of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's getting close to home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can make this run here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a yearly fluorescence changes in
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at it, I can make this
repeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call your attention to the corn belt here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that that's really bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the brightest spot on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brightest large spot on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other areas that look almost as
bright, the Ganges Delta area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some parts of Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that's saying is that photosynthesis
in the corn belt probably during the time
[SPEAKER_03]: of peak crop production is the highest of
any place on earth in at least a large
[SPEAKER_03]: patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we try to do is to
measure this also from field instruments.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fluorescence equivalent of a
satellite sitting above a soybean field
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're working on this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're trying to do is to,
this is the absorption spectrum of
[SPEAKER_03]: chlorophyll, the green and the red is the
emission spectrum of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So light that's absorbed here comes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it comes back out in these bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were doing this in a laboratory,
we just put in a filter so that we only
[SPEAKER_03]: light the plant would see light that was
in this range and then it'd be dark in
[SPEAKER_03]: this range and we could see the
fluorescence from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of hard to do again in the
field because filtering the sunlight
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would require a pretty large filter
to filter the earth's input radiation so
[SPEAKER_03]: we could walk at fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way that they figured out how to
do this was to look at the spectral
[SPEAKER_03]: composition of the light that's coming
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That of course affects the spectral
composition of the light that's going up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's shown here is a lot of what looks
like noise, but it isn't noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changes in the composition or the
intensity of the light as a function of
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelength which occurs because of things
like iron and magnesium and elements like
[SPEAKER_03]: that in the solar atmosphere that absorb
light and they cause these little divots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see them again in the upwelling light
because it's essentially sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's reflecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't change its spectral
composition, but fluorescence is new
[SPEAKER_03]: light.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no impact of the fact,
there's no impact of these spectral
[SPEAKER_03]: features of the sunlight on the spectrum
of the fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think of it, the light that you
get back out is a function of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence coming out that doesn't have
any of these divots in it and the light
[SPEAKER_03]: that's coming from the Sun which does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use a statistical tool,
it's kind of like end member unmixing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can separate those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can determine what fraction of the
total near infrared light that's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back at you has come from fluorescence and
what is just scattered light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is made possible by having
satellites that have the spectral
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution to resolve these lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We focus mostly on these lines which are
due to Fraunhofer absorptions in the solar
[SPEAKER_03]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: This big feature is due to oxygen in the
Earth's atmosphere and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: work with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a much bigger signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much easier to separate fluorescence
from scattered light using this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, it's also due to the
oxygen in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you see depends upon how much of
the atmosphere is between you and your
[SPEAKER_03]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's happened to the light has come
through the atmosphere before you actually
[SPEAKER_03]: do your measurement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a more complicated thing,
but it's possible and this is the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: we make this determination of how much
fluorescence there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is always a bit of a problematic
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got any questions about this,
feel free to interrupt and ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just, if we look at fluorescence
coming off, this is from an Amazon canopy
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of this is due to clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we look at the fluorescence that's
coming out, it's fairly well behaved and
[SPEAKER_03]: it behaves pretty well if we look at there
are ways that we can sort of normalize
[SPEAKER_03]: this either to the incoming light
intensity or to the amount of light that's
[SPEAKER_03]: reflected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of well behaved.
[SPEAKER_03]: The measurement is difficult if we're
looking at these very small spectral
[SPEAKER_03]: features, but if we're really careful the
way we do spectroscopy, control
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures, do a lot of signal averaging
and things like that, we get pretty good
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we got this method based on
resolving these fine spectral details that
[SPEAKER_03]: gives us the light emitted by chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty powerful proxy for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the initial thought that we
had was that this would all be due to
[SPEAKER_03]: changes in fluorescence yield that could
tell us about the physiology of the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and that would tell us all about
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we've gotten more and more involved in
this, it's become clear that the structure
[SPEAKER_03]: of the canopy that's doing photosynthesis
has an awful lot to do with how much
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence gets out, maybe even more
than the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has the really key component here
is what we call the escape probability,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the probability that emitted
fluorescent photosynthesis a photon that's
[SPEAKER_03]: emitted in the canopy actually makes it
out so that we could measure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very dependent upon both the
observational geometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it changes as say a satellite looks at
the surface from different directions or
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're looking at the same piece of
canopy and the sun were to go through the
[SPEAKER_03]: daily course, you'd also see that this
emission parameter would change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a directional property of the
canopy itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to sort of go back to that diagram,
what's happening here is that a photon is
[SPEAKER_03]: absorbed and some of it gets to the
reaction center.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it, since this takes a finite
period of time, chlorophyll fluorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out while it's in transit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tells you essentially something
about the lifetime that the photons or the
[SPEAKER_03]: excited state has in this pigment bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Longer the lifetime, the more fluorescence
is gonna come out relative to other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I probably skipped all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to say that we have been working
to, of course, one thing to do is to put
[SPEAKER_03]: this into a model of photosynthesis and
see if we can figure out well,
[SPEAKER_03]: how's physiology control this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a series of simulations where
we're looking at photosynthetic rate as a
[SPEAKER_03]: function of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we change the amount of the CO2 fixing
enzyme, ribisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's very low levels and very high
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has an effect on the yield of
photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got more capacity, the yield of
photochemistry can be higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get some fairly complicated
patterns of the fluorescence yield as a
[SPEAKER_03]: function of decreasing the V max.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this here is the simulated
solar-reduced fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that there are some
differences as high photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity, you tend to get more
solar-reduced fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then at low photosynthetic capacity,
but it's nowhere near the linear zero
[SPEAKER_03]: intercept relationship, which we see in
Yang's data, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we do simulations with a model that
incorporates radiation transport,
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis and fluorescent yield,
and we vary things which vary the near
[SPEAKER_03]: infrared reflectance of the canopy by
changing leaf angle distribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf area index, fractional vegetation
cover, soil color and things like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: we change the amount of solar-reduced
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we change, go through that same
matrix of things and change the
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescence yield, you get a different
slope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like what we see is something
that we see two effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is related to essentially the
structure of the canopy, and the other is
[SPEAKER_03]: related to the fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the two things simultaneously
affecting what we see from looking space.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just to show you something about
what we expect from the fluorescence
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on those models, we're looking for
the satellite at the same time of day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the satellites we're using have
polar orbits, and they come over at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same solar time for each space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're always looking at the same
illumination.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, say, illuminated with full sun
and lots of photosynthetic capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the non-photochemical quenching.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the sort of wasting image term,
and this is what's lost by fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you go to lower capacity, the
photochemistry goes down, the
[SPEAKER_03]: non-photochemical quenching goes up,
really goes up when you have stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the fluorescence, and this is
that fluorescence expanded 10 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this just shows that there's some
sensitivity to the environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that sensitivity is not the whole
story, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have wanted to do this to couple with
these kinds of measurements.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can measure the gas exchange of a
system we're doing for time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can measure the CO2 exchange and
essentially reconstruct what the gross
[SPEAKER_03]: primary productivity is, but these are
areas at about a kilometer at most in
[SPEAKER_03]: size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the solar-reduced fluorescence
measurements that we're trying to make are
[SPEAKER_03]: normally in the range of, well,
the most frequent one, the one they use
[SPEAKER_03]: the most, has a footprint of 40 kilometers
on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're too big to actually match with
these sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we could match with these sites,
we have maybe 100 of these around the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, maybe a kilometer squared each.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's at least a sampling of one part per
million of a biosphere, and that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: useful in putting together some
information about how the whole biosphere
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you understand the limitations of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But probably the best approach that's been
made so far to do this is to use machine
[SPEAKER_03]: learning to analyze these.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a student in our group, UH,
has been doing is to look at gas exchange
[SPEAKER_03]: in fairly large scales, air moving across
the continent, and try and use models and
[SPEAKER_03]: data to predict or to explain the
variation in the CO2 concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know what the CO2 is at start and
you know it at the end, you should be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to say something about what CO2 change has
occurred over the path across the
[SPEAKER_03]: continent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing from this is just
that the models that we have that are sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of the state-of-the-art or system models
get anywhere the best one does pointing at
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.6 or 0.4 of the variance, and most of
them are down here in fairly low part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the variance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solar induced fluorescence by itself is a
single variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without putting in the meteorology and a
bunch of other stuff, which are in these
[SPEAKER_03]: models, explains more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can explain more of it by putting in a
couple of other variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's cool that this is something that
seems to capture a lot of the variance
[SPEAKER_03]: that occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you want to do when you're making
a model is put in the data that's most has
[SPEAKER_03]: the largest leverage and ignore the data
that doesn't have any leverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And models principally, we don't do that
when we make models.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put in everything including the kitchen
sink.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of a refreshing way of
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we'll skip over that quickly
and go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea that we worked on was the
observation that the light that was coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from reflected by the canopy in the near
infrared seemed to correlate quite well
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was coming off fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were looking at full canopies,
and this is sorting out pixels by their
[SPEAKER_03]: normalized difference vegetation index.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that vegetation index is high,
you get a really high correlation with the
[SPEAKER_03]: near infrared reflectance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it goes down to less vegetated
pixels, of course, that correlation goes
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, well, let's just multiply
the total near infrared reflectance times
[SPEAKER_03]: the NDVI and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is SIF and that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fall in line really nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that's really nice about
this, even though it's kind of a derived
[SPEAKER_03]: product, we've got that at 300 meters
ground resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have it from 1980 to present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can now look at flux sites with
something that looks a little bit like
[SPEAKER_03]: solar induced fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't exactly the same, but it has some
of the same properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just looking at that correlated
with some global models.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just the annual NIRV sum and the
GPP modeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it captures a lot of the variability in
the biosphere all by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're looking at is essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: the normalized difference vegetation index
is this reflectance here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This green is the reflectance of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks at the ratio of this band two
and band four, the difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: those two over the sum of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a spectrum of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that there's some soil slope
there, but not nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that vegetation index for the soil,
if you were looking at the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: would be very low.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vegetation index, if you're looking at
a vegetated area, would be very high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you kind of think of it,
the light that's coming off of,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, a mixed pixel like this, you have a
very low NDVI of the light that's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: up from the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that's coming off from a leaf,
it has a very high vegetation index.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you multiply the total times this
ratio, this index, the NDVI, you
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially get something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's all coming from the leaf,
it's going to be high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your NIRV red that's coming off of the
canopy is going to be all plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to vary pretty much by what
the fraction of light that's coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the system is that's coming from the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually analogous to the way that
we're measuring fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just determining how much of the
NIRV red light is coming off leaves and
[SPEAKER_03]: multiplying that times the total.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gives us an index that's kind of
like the fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what you see if we just take
the total NIRV and compare it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for pixels.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually for all the land surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just the total near infrared
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see it's scattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some indication that there's
something there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you just multiply it by the NDVI,
you get this nice correlation because it
[SPEAKER_03]: throws away all these pixels that are
influenced by clouds or soil or other
[SPEAKER_03]: things that interfere And these are flux
sites now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take the, say, 100 or so flux sites
and look at the annual GPP sum and the sum
[SPEAKER_03]: of this NIRV, some other things that we
can analyze, it's actually quite an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement over other approaches that
have been used in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that really we found
very interesting of this is that if we
[SPEAKER_03]: took this NIRV, you would think that if
you took that and multiplied it by the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights, it'd improve things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it actually makes it worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think that what's going on,
what we're finding, is that there isn't,
[SPEAKER_03]: the NIRV has most of the environmental
correlates that have normally thought to
[SPEAKER_03]: drive photosynthesis already kind of work
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you add another one or add one
that's already in it, you just add the
[SPEAKER_03]: noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're very interested in it from that
point of view because that means we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: system is growing a canopy, which has
some, I think we'll just skip over these,
[SPEAKER_03]: except to show you that canopies are very
diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants grow those canopies under genetic
and environmental control.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have very different properties in the
way they transport radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way that they reflect near
infrared radiation seems to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: information about how they actually are
functioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really interested in it from the
point of view of understanding the biology
[SPEAKER_03]: of this control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, before stopping, just mentioned
that there are a couple of other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that are really interesting in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is an area where we're looking at
an area in the Amazon, with two different
[SPEAKER_03]: remote sensing products, one's better
cloud filtered than the other,
[SPEAKER_03]: the better remote sensing product that has
a tighter correlation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can improve this by getting better
remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a C3 soybean crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a corn crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that there's a big difference
as you'd expect because of C4
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis, things like that that can
also be put in to improve this system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works well monthly and does as well as
the best models all by itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: and does a pretty good job of simulating
global photosynthesis and something up
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the oceans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see the oceans?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually the oceans are easier
because there's no substantial reflectance
[SPEAKER_03]: in the near infrared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been using it for some time to
do fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the work has been done looking at
things like nutrient limitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new satellite that has just come
online called Tricomu that allows you to
[SPEAKER_03]: do red fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red light gets out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: The near infrared light that we're working
with, the ocean is black in that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see coastal blooms and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't worked very much with that at
this point, but I think it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if there's any effect of the
polarization of skylight that changes
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day on your fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well certainly the reflectance
remote sensing, there have been satellites
[SPEAKER_03]: put up to look at polarization of the
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: The specular reflectance off of the leaves
is polarized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if light strikes the epidermis and then
it's reflected back like a mirror,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's for reflectance a real problem
because it doesn't carry the signal of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been able to eliminate that by
looking at the polarization.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is also the satellite that measures
the OCO2 satellite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It changes its orientation as it goes
through the, from north to south,
[SPEAKER_03]: from pole to pole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of polarization, and I don't
understand the spectroscopy of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rotate the position of the slit
because of the polarization effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is important, but I don't
understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're dealing with a region that has a
water limitation throughout or semi-arid,
[SPEAKER_02]: and snowmades close, CO2 entry into the
leaf is limiting photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does your system operate when you deal
with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if the, we don't have an awful lot
of measurements where we have regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: control of water availability at this
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have drought episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we see is that droughts almost
invariably result in lower fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be, we see that droughted leaves
have less fluorescence, but not a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be that there is an additional
effect due to leaf dropping, leaf curling,
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf abscission, and things like that that
happen consistent or simultaneously with
[SPEAKER_03]: the drought, which, interestingly,
also has to do with just shedding light,
[SPEAKER_03]: just as the non-photochemical quenching
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are responding to a drought by
absorbing less light and letting less of
[SPEAKER_03]: that light get to the reaction centers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's then, because of the
limitation of water, become less able to
[SPEAKER_03]: use that light for chemistry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm struck by the intensity in the
Cornbell movie you showed, and what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering is, is that because of the
agriculture that's there, or is it because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the location?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we didn't have crops there,
would it be just as intense?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you tend to see, and we'd have to
look for small areas that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are some sites that are in
the Corn Belt, but in forests,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, that we could look at and
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My expectation is that the whole thing is
pretty much limited by the season and the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, but that for crops,
the productivity is squished into a very
[SPEAKER_03]: narrow window, and for forests,
it kind of gets spread out, and I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: be surprised if they tend to be more the
same if you add it all up over the year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't have a good answer for that at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you use this technique to look the
chlorophyll on other planets?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a very substantial change in the
reflectance of the planet in these visible
[SPEAKER_03]: wavelengths, visible and near-infrared
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been suggested as a way of looking
for photosynthetic pigments on other
[SPEAKER_03]: planets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the more likely way that we'll get
to that in the near future is looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the light that gets through the atmosphere
as the planet transients across the star,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, I think it's worth a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly worth thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do in almost all of our models of
plants of radiation transport,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, reverse system models,
is we have all kinds of very elaborate
[SPEAKER_03]: descriptions of the water relations and
the physiology of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we put in an arbitrary function for
the way that light is absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can be spherical or rectophile,
but people have avoided dealing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: explicit radiative transport of the
canopies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our work is saying that that is really
important, and we aren't going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis right, until we do that and
understand how that relates to how
[SPEAKER_03]: enzymatic capacity is also distributed
among those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that's really interesting
about this is that the work suggests that
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis isn't that strongly limited
by physiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more limited by the amount of canopy
and the structure of the canopy that's
[SPEAKER_03]: made, and we're not dealing with that at
all in modeling the Earth system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean by it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you made any tacit assumptions about
the nature of the photon itself or the
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of light itself in coming up with
your models?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, probably we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole thing about the thing on the
Sun and the linking to the chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of thing is something I made up
just recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cornered a couple of physicists to
ask them, is this really off the wall or
[SPEAKER_03]: is this about the way to explain it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, yeah, I don't like the
vocabulary we're using, but it seems about
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to give you one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
