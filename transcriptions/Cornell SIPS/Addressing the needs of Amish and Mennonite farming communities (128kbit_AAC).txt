[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll move into the subject matter at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about who the old orders
or plain sex are, and that term is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their demographics, particularly New York
state, how that impacts farming or
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do two trips into
technology and see how it impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture or production of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, wheels, tractor wheels,
and different levels of greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, we'll go quickly over
what are some opportunities for us
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly as a land-grant university to
interact with these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's begin with the origin of these
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Cornell is a wonderfully secular
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a little bit concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably the first person that's going
to quote scripture in plant science
[SPEAKER_00]: building in the last 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have to talk about religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you understand I'm doing
so, hopefully objectively, not with any
[SPEAKER_00]: endorsement or implication that any
religion or any interpretation of a given
[SPEAKER_00]: religion is implied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to talk about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to quote from the Bible so that
we can understand why these cultures have
[SPEAKER_00]: certain practices, not to imply that it's
the only way or the correct way to
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret these matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to begin by understanding
where these people come from, Protestant
[SPEAKER_00]: Reformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also recognize I'm probably speaking
to a very diverse international.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things may seem very basic to some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to cover our bases so everyone
knows what we're talking about because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity of backgrounds in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1500s, we had something
called the Protestant Reformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protestant Reformation, the most famous
figure there is Martin Luther,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had a series of issues with,
at that point, the Catholic Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his protest of the Catholic Church
began what's known as Protestantism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the early 1500s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a small group of people who felt
that the Protestant Reformation was in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way either incomplete in the changes
they were making or in some way corrupt,
[SPEAKER_00]: both materially and spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Protestant Reformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the early 1500s,
we had a group of people known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Anabaptists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anabaptists means rebaptizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are people who felt that at that
point Lutheran infant baptism was
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate, and it should be a
believer's baptism.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called Anabaptists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This name sticks today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the early figures in this group was
a man named Menno Simons.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a converted Catholic priest
converted to Anabaptism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then his name, Menno, is where we get
the term Mennonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this name still exists today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a person with this name,
Menno.
[SPEAKER_01]: What nation was he living in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he was Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he may have been living in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going on in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from a number of nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Menno Simons is where we get Mennonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mennonites are, let's say,
a unified group until almost 200 years
[SPEAKER_00]: into the late 1690s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a dissenting group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group preferred a stricter
interpretation of discipline of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: church members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this name, we have the Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have this line representing the
Mennonites and this line representing
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish people, we now have a division of
the Amish people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a division that happened several
hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have kind of a parallel cultural
progression of these two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a sense, the Amish are Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within Anabaptism, we have many
people who would claim this as their
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would be what we would see very
worldly in their practice, perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: indistinguishable in their lifestyle or
their dress, compared to other Christian
[SPEAKER_00]: groups or Protestant groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very small subset of Anabaptists are
what we call plain people, so people who
[SPEAKER_00]: generally would adhere to a nonconformist
style of dress and probably have some
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on their lifestyle in terms
of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another definition now is old order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have old order Amish, Mennonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two groups we're going to
talk about mainly today, Hutterites,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are communal people generally in
Western North America, and Brethren.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have some groups in New York
that are very similar to Hutterites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably won't have time to talk about
them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand these groups,
we have to recognize that they are very
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy on tradition compared to other
ideologies we'd find in North America
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept is tradition is used to put
principles into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go with our scripture quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women will adorn themselves in modest
apparel, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of these scripture, we have
admonishments about dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a tradition is used to instill
what that principle is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principle is, in this case,
women are going to dress more modestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a practice or church
guidelines on how exactly that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separation is probably the most important
concept to understand when trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out why Amish Mennonites do the
things they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a number of references in the
Bible about being separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to nonconformist dress,
rejection of certain technologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, rejecting an automobile or
ownership of an automobile, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyles, and possibly political
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another reference on humility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this concept of humility is also real
basic to understanding why these people do
[SPEAKER_00]: the things they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few other key points on how these
groups differ from other church groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ministry is chosen by lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk about ministry real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bishops,
[SPEAKER_00]: ministers, and deacons in an old order
church, in descending order of,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, authority within the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are chosen by a lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time to go into that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're chosen by the laity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the lay members in a given
congregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no campaigning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no raising your hand to say,
I want to be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lottery process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no compensation for that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're struggling to understand why
people do certain things, this is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the key concept I find.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quote from the Book of John,
we are in the world, but not of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that concept that we are going to be
more like pilgrims here on this earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to reject a majority of
what society does, because it subways,
[SPEAKER_00]: interferes with our spirituality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is restricted to eight grades,
first through eighth grade, in one-room
[SPEAKER_00]: schoolhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are parochial schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schoolhouses, this is in Chautauqua
County, with a conservative Amish group
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the teachers are usually young women,
late teenagers, early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young single women, generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a real spectrum of plain people,
old orders, any term we want to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the key concepts I'd like
you to take away from this talk today,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there are a diversity of people
who practice this lifestyle, a very
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this slide, what I've tried to do
is point out, give you some sample names
[SPEAKER_00]: of what some of these groups would be,
and where they would be on this scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: technology acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some very conservative groups,
Schwarz and Trouber, which we have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern part of New York State,
that would reject a lot of modern
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah Hoover Mennonites, who we don't have
in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lancaster Amish, which in addition to
being a location, is a branch of Amish,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we do have in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stouffer Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, in Buggy Mennonites,
New Order Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to this point on the scale,
the automobile comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have a working thesis that where a
group sits on this scale has a number in
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a group of people who are bound by a
very different set of rules than the
[SPEAKER_00]: people found by this set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what goes on here does not directly
impact what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The church structure itself is what's
going on in this group.
It's a group of people who are bound by a
very different set of rules than the
people found by this set.
[SPEAKER_00]: What keeps these rules in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to move this just so I can
see the clock.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we get off that chart and get into
automobiles, we do have still plain
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing groups that would drive
automobiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what we call,
what I don't call, but some people call,
[SPEAKER_00]: black bumper Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people split off from the horse and
buggy Mennonites in 1927 simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: they saw the automobile as a horseless
carriage and wanted to keep their lives
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group is very common in New York
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to speak about them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of young women that might
be from a plain population that would
[SPEAKER_00]: drive an automobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some samples of what those
groups might, their names might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may actually be Amish in some
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this young woman may have a Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to talk about these
groups today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking about horse and
buggy groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's begin with the Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some friends of mine from Seneca
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: North American population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 480 settlements in 30 states,
as well as Ontario, divided into 2,100
[SPEAKER_00]: church districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That population is close to 300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand these populations,
we need to look at what is a settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So settlement is just simply a geographic
location of Amish people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the broadest definition of where
they are on a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply means there are Amish people
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, settlements are broken down into
districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A district refers to about 25 to 35
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is controlled by the number of
people you can comfortably fit into a
[SPEAKER_00]: household to have a church service on a
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Settlements and districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a settlement could be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Settlement could be thousands,
tens of thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A district is always going to be
constricted down to somewhere between 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 40 families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the government, these rules that we
talk about for these people, for Amish
[SPEAKER_00]: people, is a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's established at this level,
at the district level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's established by input from the
church members, the laity, to the ministry
[SPEAKER_00]: that we just discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a very heterogeneous way to
practice the Amish faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sociologist that I work with
occasionally, Don Crabill in Elizabethtown
[SPEAKER_00]: College, who says there are 2,100 ways to
be Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those rules vary district by district.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population of about 300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York State, we have 50
settlements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just simply a spot on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 112 church districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our population today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to 17,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: These statistics also come from
Elizabethtown College.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the bishop come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Question is, where does the bishop come
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: In what way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bishop's top.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bishop is going to have authority over a
district, or one to two districts,
[SPEAKER_00]: or several districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no single person in charge of an
entire settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would more likely have a group of
bishops that would work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our top five states with Amish
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State is, we are fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at the top three are just very
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are characterized by very large
settlements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Wisconsin and New York,
we are battling it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the snowstorms in Western New York
last week, I have a feeling that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to overtake Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the largest 12 Amish settlements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see the top three,
Lancaster County, Holmes County,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lagrange, Indiana, are much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we drop off here,
these settlement sizes go way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you an idea of how big a
settlement can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no parallel for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that New York is not on
that list at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are number five and really are very
close to being number four for total
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that tell us about our Amish
population in New York State?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of small settlements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's population change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And population change in New York is
really the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, let's see, 09 to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our number of districts increased by 31%,
which is the greatest of any state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our population also increased by 31%,
greater than any other state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to, let's see, this is 08 to 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the number of settlements
in the state increased by almost 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our population increased over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 57%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see some of these states are
actually losing Amish settlements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin lost five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that initial mass, that initial
population is so great in a place like
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania that even though they're
losing settlements, their population
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where these people are in each dot
representing
[SPEAKER_00]: an Amish settlement or an Amish district.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to the unique geography of New
York, I have to present this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: rectangular fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm cutting off the infamous White
Plains Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see where these people are
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, this has been a very large
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cataraugus, Chautauqua County,
Kanawango Valley, fairly conservative
[SPEAKER_00]: group of Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger Lakes is another major growth area,
as Don mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penyan would actually be an older
Mennonite settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we have the St.
Lawrence Valley and the Mohawk Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're new to New York state,
you're not familiar with geography,
[SPEAKER_00]: this map will more or less tell you where
there is viable farmland or affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: farmland in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made this this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of these should represent old
order Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this circle right here should
be an old order Mennonite group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a horse and buggy group.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these should be horse and buggy
Mennonite groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one up here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about old order Mennonites
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a feat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a young couple here with five
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all under the age of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Amish Mennonites are hard workers,
but no one can work quite that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of these girls actually come from
another family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are the old order Mennonites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Old order Mennonites have several
commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horse and buggy is their primary
transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They speak a language that we call
Pennsylvania German, sometimes called
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania German would be more
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have plain dress and restrictive
standards on church technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group that I'll talk about most today
is called Roffdale Conference or Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: Wenger Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is about 20,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a couple years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 settlements in nine states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people represent somewhere around
10% of the total horse and buggy
[SPEAKER_00]: population in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is would the dress
being black represent Amish or Mennonite?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just Sunday dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are getting home from church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dress, for those of us who operate in
these circles, there's a thousand visual
[SPEAKER_00]: cues in a photo like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a thousand, but a couple dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to tell you about this
person's church affiliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, dress color and the way certain
things are cut can tell you about what
[SPEAKER_00]: church someone is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a little bit of experience to
pick up on those visual cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about how Mennonites differ
from Amish in their social structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the word here conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whereas I said there are over 2,100
Amish districts, each with their own
[SPEAKER_00]: autonomy on how they're going to practice
their religion, even though it may seem
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to those of us on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this large older Mennonite
group, we have 20,000 people, nine
[SPEAKER_00]: different states, with a conference
structure, which means they're unified in
[SPEAKER_00]: what their church practices are going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What their technology, what is the
expected dress, what are the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens through a conference
structure where the ministry will gather
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a year to see that all members are
in accord with what those standards are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a very large overarching
church structure there versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it creates a very homogeneous church
compared to the very heterogeneous Amish,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though all these people are using
horse and buggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the New York story for older Mennonites
is really a unique one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's exploded in the
central Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nearly 600 households,
32 in this one settlement, 32 one-room
[SPEAKER_00]: school houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be stretching from just north
of Watkins and Glen to just south of
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the largest horse and buggy
Mennonite community outside of Lancaster,
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably the fastest one to ever reach
that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to do technology very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tractors originally came out with steel
wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old steam tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the 1930s, even in the 1920s,
early 1900s, tractors were manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: with gasoline engines and other types of
fuel so that a small farmer could use
[SPEAKER_00]: them, particularly a farmer in the
Northeast US.
[SPEAKER_00]: They originally came out on steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This horse and buggy Mennonite church made
a decision to stay with steel wheel
[SPEAKER_00]: tractors until today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they farmer tractors, drive a horse and
buggy, but they put the tractors on steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tractor, you probably don't
recognize the maker if you're not into
[SPEAKER_00]: tractors, you might not think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Yanmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was built in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was originally intended for use on a
rice paddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is with set on technology from
the 19, in this case, 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are laying plastics for the
use of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of young women and a
young man transplanting onions on silver
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic mulch, drip irrigation,
fertilization's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have a John Deere tractor
on steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives the older Mennonites an
incredible advantage in agriculture in
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are able to farm large acreage
and accomplish a lot of tasks on the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would not be able to otherwise,
yet they still retain the horse and buggy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has all these social benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a young woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's about 15 who is bringing her
product, in this case, some vegetables to
[SPEAKER_00]: market with a steel wheel tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the horse and buggy
Mennonite has an advantage over their
[SPEAKER_00]: non-Amish or Mennonite counterpart in that
a 15-year-old girl would never be allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive dad's truck to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a fascinating turn of events
with technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a, I don't know how many
ton combine also on steel because the
[SPEAKER_00]: church regulation here is that any machine
that is self-propelled and can be ridden
[SPEAKER_00]: upon will be on steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this thing has sophisticated computer
technology inside of it, yet still runs on
[SPEAKER_00]: steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of the steel wheels is not
simply that the 1920s technology was the
[SPEAKER_00]: best technology, but we want to avoid
having the tractor turn into a mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: personal transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the steel wheel is in and intended to
keep the tractor from becoming an
[SPEAKER_00]: automobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the steel wheel is a church
regulation to support the use of the horse
[SPEAKER_00]: and buggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the quickest I can cover that
steel wheel issue for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's not self-propelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill has an observation here that's
pulling a rubber-wired, a rubber-tired
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor, which in this church would be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is, will be a surprise to many
people, but the Amish also use tractors,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Amish groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're talking about diverse
groups, diverse standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Amish tractor in Lancaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pulling very heavy bins of onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a research project on this farm and
you'll notice this also on steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity, these are old order metanites
in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the province of Ontario and you
can see here their gathering straw behind
[SPEAKER_00]: horses on a rubber-tired hay wagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Amish boy in Seneca County,
heading hay behind a team of four horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Stouffer metanite in Orleans
County, New York, and you'll see a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating combination of technology here
in that we have a team of horses,
[SPEAKER_00]: a baler with a kicker on it into a hay
wagon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a piece of technology that will
kick the bale up into the wagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would not be allowed in certain
churches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a fascinating combination of
technologies there based on church group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Joe Wenger metanites or that
very large group I told you about with a
[SPEAKER_00]: steel wheel tractor now instead of horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing doesn't have a kicker on it and
they're stacking those things on a flat
[SPEAKER_00]: wagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it can be very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish with tractors, metanites with
horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make matters worse, the horses
pictured here are neither Amish nor
[SPEAKER_00]: metanite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're agnostic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll move into greenhouse technology
real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with high tunnels and greenhouse
vegetables a lot and we'll talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: these different church standards impact
production technology and the way that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: and my colleagues interact with these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of greenhouse faculty in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any opportunities for ventilation here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunities for improvement,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so based on certain church groups,
you may have opportunities to ventilate in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into greenhouse production,
this is a very bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no ventilation on this structure
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being used to grow vegetable
transplants on an Amish farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in here almost entirely full with
tomato transplants intended to go to other
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had overheated because there is no
ventilation and every tomato plant in that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse had lost its primary growing
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use this slide to share with other
farmers, Amish, non-Amish, metanites,
[SPEAKER_00]: on what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another way we can look at
greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Swiss Amish gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's manually ventilating here with a
roll up side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an older metanite who manufactured
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've improved over that previous
slide, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some passive ventilation there or
manual ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move up that spectrum, think back to
that slide I showed you where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these different gradations of technology
acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image probably means nothing to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an inflation apparatus to inflate
two layers of plastic on a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's used with compressed air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some church groups will allow diesel
generators to compress air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that compressed air can be used to
accomplish a lot of tasks on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, create an inflation layer on
a greenhouse, which improves our value on
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse or our ability to retain
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look now at a more advanced form of
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another Amish place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we have very tall side
walls here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a greenhouse tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have horizontal airflow fans to
break up the layer of carbon dioxide or
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or whatever is going on down in
this canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this HAF fan is driven with compressed
air and a piston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is air powered air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this slide all the time to tell
people what to do right inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendous amount of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we want inside of a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're greenhouse vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to turn over the amount of the
cubic air that we have inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that impact me as I work with
different farmers in their different
[SPEAKER_00]: church groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do the same thing with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have coal heat inside of a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have no fans, if my church does not
allow me to blow air with compressed air
[SPEAKER_00]: or electricity, how does that impact my
ability to circulate heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an outdoor boiler for in-ground
heat production of winter greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real common situation where we
have wood heat inside of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find is that these chimneys or
exhaust pipes are often built on the
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute flattest angle possible in this
type of greenhouse to try to capture as
[SPEAKER_00]: much heat as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about how that impacts,
number one, how the grower is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a crop instead of having a propane
forced air heater that's moving out
[SPEAKER_00]: several million BTUs of heat across the
structure versus, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: a homemade wood stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish Mennonite people are not stuck in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tinker with existing
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in situations where you're not allowed
to have compressed air or inflate a layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of plastic on a greenhouse, which is the
best management practice, this was
[SPEAKER_00]: developed by Amish farmers to actually
capture wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it channels down in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that wind is actually used to
inflate this layer of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a very sustainable
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little, that's for excess
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same type of inflator on a
multiple bay greenhouse in Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same concept, inflating a layer of
plastic, in this case of a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictive church and technology in
Chautauqua County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grower here has placed spacers
between two layers of plastic to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: create an inflation layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at greenhouse technology
in and of itself, we have a wide spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: of acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably have increased innovation
based on the more restrictive church that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have these different groups
where they sell out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm working with someone who's using
wood heat, we're going to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent manual ventilation, chimneys,
decreased plant density, smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things I have to keep in mind as
I work with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to highlight the Old Order
Mennonites real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baptism represents formal membership into
a church.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you actually become an Amish or
a Mennonite once you join that,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you are baptized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are baptisms into Old Order
Mennonite Church in New York over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you become baptized, you enter a
period of youth where you participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: youth activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you more about those if you
want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like young people all over the
world, this is a time to find a young
[SPEAKER_00]: person, maybe your potential husband or
wife for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to a marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have, this is Groft Dale
Conference Old Order Mennonite Weddings in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York from the 70s to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know what happens after a
wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is inside a wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Old Order Mennonite ladies
singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things can be very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Penyan at a wedding I was
privileged to attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't even capture the full range
of buggies that were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you a few snapshots from
what it's like to be at one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all heard of valet parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish Mennonite Weddings also have valet
parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come with your buggy, and then there's
these young men who are dressed more
[SPEAKER_00]: informally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their job is to tend the horses and
bring up everyone's buggy when it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called hustlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to, it's really hard to
quantify, say, cultural success.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know that a culture is thriving
and doing well?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at a few things such as
retention or what sociologists call
[SPEAKER_00]: recruitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Old Order Mennonites have about 90%
retention of the young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night youth gatherings,
this is where people get together and sing
[SPEAKER_00]: and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: 350, 250, two singing schools,
15 hockey teams in Yates County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pea shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they go for about $30 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be grown in the wintertime in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of opportunities for
extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday if I get invited to give this talk
to the Department of Plant Pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will love this image because it's a
young woman watering petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water from the petunias is down
draining on top of these tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know they're all going to say,
oh, petunias are now confirmed as a host
[SPEAKER_00]: of late life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of opportunity for the
type of work I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is maybe how do we
effectively do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's building relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all effective extension work,
this is a family I've worked closely with
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three or four of these people are now
married.
[SPEAKER_00]: This young woman is now in the dating
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy just shot his first deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman just buried her dad a couple
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building relationships is probably the
key to any successful extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some people that Chris Ween knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, you were on this trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is up near Willsboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nelson Hoover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I thought I should do
is maybe integrate these people into the
[SPEAKER_00]: research or extension work I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the gentleman there to my
right and his wife, Nelson and Ruth
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoover, actually do work for me in terms
of collecting data and variety trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This young woman with a clipboard,
her name is Alma Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Alma Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's married now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really miss her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bright young woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, she's collecting data on
biological control of threats in
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are her brothers planning out a
grafted cucumber trial for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whereas people might not work directly
for me, we might be able to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: on-farm research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're trying different forms
of plastic mulch for vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is me all the way out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a meeting of about 100 people
in Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of on-farms meetings with
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture was taken by a young woman,
Elizabeth Buck, who works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me there in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is last year in Schuyler County.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent any of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very informative book.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Karen Johnson Weiner, who's at St.
Lawrence University, New York Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a couple of years old now,
but she goes over a lot of the groups in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State and how they differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for Old Order Mennonites,
there's a book called Horse and Buggy
[SPEAKER_00]: Mennonites written by Crabill and Herd in
2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to review the manuscript for
this book and also have several photo
[SPEAKER_00]: credits in that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of excellent
resources if you want to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I went long, and I had to skip a
couple of my major points to try to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, we can switch to
questions, Don?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, say you're addressing
a difficult issue in production,
[SPEAKER_00]: would it be better maybe to go to church
authority level to try to address the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough question to answer concisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My quick answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I approach this, and I hope other
people do as well, without trying to place
[SPEAKER_00]: any judgment on where is the right place
to be on this spectrum of technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other belief system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moreover, how can I help someone
succeed in what they're doing given their
[SPEAKER_00]: own cultural constraints and try to make
no influence at all on those cultural
constraints?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think once the people you're
working with perceive that, that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not there to influence them culturally,
then you're probably going to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: success in assisting them with their
production techniques once they become
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes fun, sitting down saying,
how can we heat this greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with a grower in Steuben
County, not able to use propane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a tomato greenhouse there with
kerosene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kerosene is tough to have a furnace
that actually burns kerosene efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: and can put out the BTUs you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had multiple kerosene heaters in
that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, given the variability
in the different groups, how do we learn
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that we can be sensitive to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observation is probably better,
to be there and observe and pick up what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can and occasionally ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have compressed air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Major division in Amish technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compressed air or no compressed air?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can usually pick that out pretty
quickly based on other factors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you learn to look at certain visual
cues that are going to tell you where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is OK to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have compressed air?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the first thing I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, was this, in a sense,
assigned to me when I started,
[SPEAKER_00]: or did I just develop on my own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, I think in the Finger Lakes,
there was not someone who was specializing
[SPEAKER_00]: in this scale of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the local extension office that hired
me made it clear that they wanted me to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the great thing about working in
a college like we have here is that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been encouraged then to develop this
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expertise, I guess you could say,
by the people I work with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had great support for what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that the demand is there for
not just what I might bring or my program
[SPEAKER_00]: brings, but all of what the college and
the extension system brings to these
[SPEAKER_00]: farming operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a question on gender and maybe
ownership of private property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole talk could have been on gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I can say about that,
except we have very traditional society.
[SPEAKER_00]: A patriarchal society where the man is the
head of the household and in the positions
[SPEAKER_00]: of authority in the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: The woman is very active in making
decisions and influencing decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: both on farming practices and on church
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But women do have input into church
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will say about gender is it's
something that we need to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cognizant of, as we do our work,
respect boundaries and respect the values
[SPEAKER_00]: that a certain group may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be an issue if a female
extension worker, which we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: in our system, needs to provide
information, say, to a dairy farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, the father, the dad,
is going to be the person in charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: that operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain things you might
want to observe in terms of how you dress,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you schedule a meeting so that you
never stay alone with that person at any
[SPEAKER_00]: given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work is actually the opposite in that
in, say, greenhouse vegetable production
[SPEAKER_00]: or vegetable farming in general,
women tend to be engaged more so than
[SPEAKER_00]: other types of farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at times, that may be their specific
business or their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I end up interacting with a lot of
women at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I can say about gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Machinery and farms, they're privately
owned by families.
[SPEAKER_00]: The church doesn't own any property per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about technology and
innovation, where maybe it's highest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is it my role?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not my role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea I'm presenting here,
and I'm not sure I developed this idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you're innovation with technology
is going to be higher somewhere probably
[SPEAKER_00]: further back in the scale in terms of
restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I allow electricity and I allow almost
all other forms of technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do much innovation in
terms of retrofitting something to fit my
[SPEAKER_00]: church standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have electricity to inflate a
layer of plastic, I can just put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fan that will do that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's wired in with 110 current.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a part of probably what I
would try to say is that there's a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point in that scale where you enjoy all
the benefits of an old order culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means large family size,
which means communal support in your
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also enjoying a lot of
technological benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those people probably have the
highest percentage of their populations in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're maybe 3 quarters of the way
up that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are further back are
working much harder to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are doing more work just to keep
a household going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say in your church group,
you have a propane kitchen stove,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to bake a loaf of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it to 350, and you press a button,
and it heats it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say you want to bake a loaf of
bread, and in your group, you heat with
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that becomes a real art.
[SPEAKER_00]: To manage a cook stove to have a
temperature with a wood fire to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice loaf of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this creates more manual labor down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, given those
differences, is there a lot of technology
[SPEAKER_00]: communication between the groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but probably not on that subject
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tremendous communication between
these groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't begin to tell you how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's written publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not talking about technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be talking about how to grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be talking about how to raise
animals on pasture and things of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are publishing houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can I say about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tremendous communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
