[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engaged learning is a key component of our
mission at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we prepare students to be creative,
collaborative, and critically reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that really seriously in
horticulture, where we engage students in
[SPEAKER_00]: three important ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide students with direct,
hands-on experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also give students chances to apply
what they've learned in communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the community of the classroom to
local and global settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we provide students with opportunities
to reflect on their learning, to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: and articulate how they will use what
they've learned to make the world a better
[SPEAKER_00]: place as they grow to become leaders in
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does engaged learning look like in
horticulture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students in Creating the Urban Eden serve
the campus community while they learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They design and install landscape
plantings as part of their intensive study
[SPEAKER_00]: of more than 300 species of trees,
shrubs, and vines, including this runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering bioswale along Tower Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all enjoy the visual impact of their
work, walking across this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In horticultural science and systems,
students delve into many hands-on
[SPEAKER_00]: activities, from planting trees to
harvesting peppers to donating to a local
[SPEAKER_00]: food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sample food, remove invasive plants
from natural areas, and create textile art
[SPEAKER_00]: with plant-based dyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every fall, students in Restoration
Ecology take on a real-world project in
[SPEAKER_00]: the local community, working together to
gather data, analyze the issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: and report their findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year, they investigated cost-effective
options for using sediment from future
[SPEAKER_00]: dredging in the Cayuga Lake inlet to
promote ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiential learning students gain in
the field is not separate from their
[SPEAKER_00]: classroom experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, it builds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural science majors and many plant
science majors complete a summer
[SPEAKER_00]: internship to explore career interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply coursework to real-world
problems and network with growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural professionals, as well as
K-12 audiences, Master Gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some create blogs to reflect on their
experiences, both what they learned and
[SPEAKER_00]: then how it changed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viticulture and Enology majors are also
engaged in all phases of growing grapes
[SPEAKER_00]: and making wine, from planting,
pruning, and managing a 500-vine organic
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard near campus, to harvesting the
grapes and bottling the fruits of their
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my course, The Art of Horticulture,
students get firsthand experience with a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of plant-based materials and media,
choosing one for an intensive creative
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: In-class experiences strengthen the link
to learning, and exercises and writing
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages students to reflect on the
impact of nature and gardens on their
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create public art, which may range from
a sod sofa on campus to special
[SPEAKER_00]: installations, such as the large-scale
stickwork willow sculpture at the Ithaca
[SPEAKER_00]: Children's Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budding student researchers frequently are
guided in individual studies of their own
[SPEAKER_00]: design by faculty mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students have worked with one professor to
grow vegetable transplants for
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution to low-income families to
encourage home gardening and healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have worked in communities through
cooperative extension programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from school garden partnerships
with elementary schools to working with
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands-on Horticulture instills non-majors
with a lifelong appreciation for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and teaches them basic horticultural
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply techniques such as pruning to
campus landscapes and fruit trees at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And students in a freshman seminar have
gotten their hands dirty partnering with
[SPEAKER_00]: Habitat for Humanity to seed lawns for
low-income housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cornell is a global university,
and the communities in which our students
[SPEAKER_00]: work extend far beyond Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my course, Experiential Garden-Based
Learning in Belize, the students spend
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire spring break creating school
gardens and teaching lessons that tie the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden to the curriculum in southern
Belize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by focusing on those three things,
direct experience, reflection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and community engagement, we're preparing
our students to become leaders in their
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their communities and all around the
world.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
