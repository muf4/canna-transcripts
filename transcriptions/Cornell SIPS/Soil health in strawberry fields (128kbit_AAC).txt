[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Marvin, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks, all of you, for coming here to
see this presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I don't have a nice British
accent like our speaker last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it'll still be, hopefully,
interesting in what I have to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially because it has to do with
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think most of you are enjoying some
strawberry products right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can all appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can all appreciate how to produce
better strawberries and more strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Marvin mentioned, I'm doing soil
health in strawberry fields, specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: soil biological health and how we manage
that field affects the biological health
[SPEAKER_05]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to kind of go through my
research, the issue that we saw,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then show you some of my results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing I want to do is define
soil health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, when people talk about soil
health, they like to put this Venn diagram
[SPEAKER_05]: up and say that soil health is at the
intersection of your chemical,
[SPEAKER_05]: your physical, and your biological soil
components.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say soil health is right there in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil health does fall in the middle of all
of these different soil components.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I don't think that this diagram
does a great job distinguishing the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference between a typical soil test and
a soil health test.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, pH, which is a typical
soil test that we'd run, you'd say that's
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when you think about it,
the plants that grow in that soil and the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes that live in that soil affect the
pH.
[SPEAKER_05]: And likewise, the pH of that soil affects
the plants and the microbes that can grow
[SPEAKER_05]: in that soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really, pH is somewhere in this gray
area here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for another example, aggregation.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, we'd say that's a physical component
of your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then aggregation is helped by
bacterial mucigels and fungal mycelia that
[SPEAKER_05]: help hold the aggregates together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really, aggregation is also in this
gray area here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my idea is that while soil health does
fall, the intersection of these three most
[SPEAKER_05]: soil tests fall somewhere there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to really explain soil health,
I prefer to use the definition that was
[SPEAKER_05]: created by the Soil Science Society of
America at their committee on soil
[SPEAKER_05]: quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they define soil health as the capacity
of a specific kind of soil to function
[SPEAKER_05]: within both managed and natural ecosystems
to sustain plant and animal productivity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to maintain or enhance water
and air quality and support human
[SPEAKER_05]: habitation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's kind of a lot in that
definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it might be hard to visualize just
reading all of those words.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I were to make a Venn diagram of
soil health, it would be more like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say that first and foremost,
we have to define what our soil function
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we growing something on the soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do we want to support a park?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do we want to build a building?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the function of that soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once we've defined that function,
we want it to have ecosystem
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want it to maintain our air and
water quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then because we're a little bit
egocentric, we need it to support humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it doesn't support us, we're not going
to manage that soil in that way for very
[SPEAKER_05]: long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a critical component of a healthy
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that intersection there,
which is a little bit maybe smaller of an
[SPEAKER_05]: overlap, that's where we have a really
healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might notice that most of these,
all four of these, are somewhat defined
[SPEAKER_05]: components of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get to define them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get to say what the soil function
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get to say how that soil is
supporting humans, which makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: scientists a little bit nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that means that since we're
defining them, that these definitions can
[SPEAKER_05]: shift with time and political and social
movements.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, air and water quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, climate change and in the
future, climate change will also be a big
[SPEAKER_05]: issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're concerned about carbon dioxide
emissions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a while back, and who knows what will
happen in the future, carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_05]: emissions weren't really what we're
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today, carbon dioxide emissions might
be part of a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the future or maybe in the past,
they weren't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that we kind of get to put
emphasis on what we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the healthy soil definition can kind of
shift.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our case, we're looking at healthy soil
in a strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that soil function that we've defined
is to produce strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that ecosystem sustainability,
what we want it to do is to provide a good
[SPEAKER_05]: habitat for soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that can help us reduce
external inputs to the system,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we won't have to add fertilizers
as often or external fertilizers if the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil microbial community can do a good job
of cycling nutrients back through the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also hope that the good soil microbial
community will cut back on disease
[SPEAKER_05]: incidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we won't have to put as many
pesticides on the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still want this soil to maintain air
and water quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need it to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not profitable, a grower can't
continue to grow strawberries that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of our soil health goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we want our soil to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, there's no way to just
measure all four of those bullet points
[SPEAKER_05]: with one test.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a soil health test.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do is we define our goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have to come up with the
desired soil functions that will get us to
[SPEAKER_05]: that goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, a desired soil function
that we might have would be to increase
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil microbial community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we choose indicators that measure
that soil desired function.
[SPEAKER_05]: So indicators that might measure soil
microbial community could be respiration
[SPEAKER_05]: or chloroform fumigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we run that indicator test,
and we get a value from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say we run a respiration test,
and we get a value of 10 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's meaningless until we value it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we put that indicator value
through a scoring function, and we score
[SPEAKER_05]: it based on whether we want more of that
indicator, whether we want less of that
[SPEAKER_05]: indicator, or whether we want that
indicator to fall within a specific range.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once it has a score, we can combine
all the scores of all the indicators that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've tested, that we've run, and we get a
final soil quality score.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no way to jump directly from
here to here, but we can break this out
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of tease it apart, and then
hopefully combine it back together to get
[SPEAKER_05]: our soil quality score.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we've chosen our indicators
appropriately so that they accurately give
[SPEAKER_05]: a soil quality score that represents the
soil in our field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be a little bit difficult making
sure that we've selected all these correct
[SPEAKER_05]: indicators and that our soil quality score
relates back to this soil health goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're choosing soil health
indicators, there are a couple different
[SPEAKER_05]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: First and foremost, we have to accurately
target that soil function that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in, because if they're not
targeting that function, then it's
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhat meaningless.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also have to be quick to respond
to management practices, because if we
[SPEAKER_05]: change our management practice but the
indicator test doesn't respond,
[SPEAKER_05]: we could be degrading our soil for many
years before we realize that we have to go
[SPEAKER_05]: back and make some changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also important for them to be
inexpensive, reliable, and fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that can be tricky, and I think that as
soil health tests become more and more
[SPEAKER_05]: popular, that people will learn which
indicators are more useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in 2008, Cornell created their own
soil health training manual, and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: available to growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I mentioned, they had to choose
indicators, and they are upgrading their
[SPEAKER_05]: indicators so that they're more applicable
to a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started, the indicators that were
in a soil health test are different from
[SPEAKER_05]: the indicators that are there now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at their test scorecard
that they give you, if you get a Cornell
[SPEAKER_05]: soil health test, we can see that it kind
of follows that flow chart that I showed
[SPEAKER_05]: you a couple slides ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we've got our chemical,
our biological, and our physical
[SPEAKER_05]: components of our soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those would be the desired soil
functions that they want the soil to
[SPEAKER_05]: complete.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they've chosen indicators here
that indicate those three different
[SPEAKER_05]: functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, one of the biological
function, we want our soil to function
[SPEAKER_05]: well biologically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've said percent organic matter is
an indicator of how well your soil will
[SPEAKER_05]: function biologically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they ran that test, and they got
a value of 2.6.
[SPEAKER_05]: That value of 2.6, we don't really know
what that means yet until we run it
[SPEAKER_05]: through a scoring function.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we score it based on whether we want
more, less, or specific range.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they wanted more of percent organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since 2.6 is somewhat low,
they only gave it a rating, so a score of
[SPEAKER_05]: 25.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their rating scale goes from 1 to 100,
1 being the least desirable and 100 being
[SPEAKER_05]: the most desirable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see here we have a 100 for pH,
a 100 for extractable phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we go all the way down to 9 for
potentially mineralizable nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they score those each indicator,
and then they combine them to an overall
[SPEAKER_05]: soil quality score.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this soil got a score of 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's kind of how it looks in
reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Cornell soil health test was
developed mostly mainly on grain and
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my advisor, Marvin, wanted to try and
make it more applicable to berry growers,
[SPEAKER_05]: since we want to encourage berry growers
to also have healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if any of you are interested,
this is a yellow collar that's being
[SPEAKER_05]: developed out in Geneva, so we can be
proud of our beautiful collards.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Marvin gave Cornell soil health test
to berry growers across upstate New York
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to make sure that this test was
applicable to berry growers and get them
[SPEAKER_05]: excited about it, we looked at the
strawberry grower data on its own and
[SPEAKER_05]: noticed that the biological soil health
indicators from those tests all came back
[SPEAKER_05]: very low.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see these are the biological
indicators that we looked at, organic
[SPEAKER_05]: matter, active carbon, potentially
mineralizable nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see that their indicator
ratings on that scale from 1 to 100 are
[SPEAKER_05]: all kind of below 30, so they had pretty
low soil biological health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were a little bit confused by this
because strawberry growers add a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: organic matter to their fields through
straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they'll do is they'll put straw in
their fields in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you pile straw up, it traps a lot
of air and acts as a really great
[SPEAKER_05]: insulator for the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll put the straw on in the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they've piled enough on there,
you can see that they have nice,
[SPEAKER_05]: undamaged flowers in the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if they don't put enough on or
they don't insulate their plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: they can get cold damage, especially in
the early spring, like we see here with
[SPEAKER_05]: this black flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they put them on in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: They let them overwinter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the spring, the growers will
come and they'll rake the straw between
[SPEAKER_05]: the rows and then the straw that was once
an insulator then becomes a mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this mulch layer is really important
because it keeps the berries up off the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil carries a lot of berry diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the soil can't reach the berry,
then it doesn't get those diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really important layer between
the soil and the berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also keeps the berries clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's important because a strawberry
grower can't wash their berries before
[SPEAKER_05]: they ship their berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they were to wash their berries
before shipping them, by the time it
[SPEAKER_05]: reached the consumer, the berries would be
rotted.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the other hand, no consumer is
going to want to buy dirty berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having those clean berries where the
soil can't bounce up onto them from the
[SPEAKER_05]: rain is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're adding a lot of organic matter to
these systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless, we have low soil biological
health.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we know that straw has a really
high carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been shown in other studies that
carbon to nitrogen ratio, especially when
[SPEAKER_05]: high, can have a negative effect on soil
biological health.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a graph from a different
experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we just focus on two lines here,
we've got broccoli residue in the solid
[SPEAKER_05]: black line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this dotted line is broccoli residue
plus wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: So broccoli residue on its own has a very
low carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: But broccoli residue plus wheat straw has
a much higher carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on this y-axis here, we have net
nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that the zero,
no nitrogen mineralization, is right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we have that low carbon to nitrogen
ratio amendment, the broccoli,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can see that we're having positive net
nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we put on that higher carbon to
nitrogen amendment where we add in the
[SPEAKER_05]: wheat straw, we can see that we actually
have negative nitrogen mineralization,
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning that we're having nitrogen
immobilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's indicating that there's poor
biological soil health.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the goal that we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want more nitrogen in our soil,
not less.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were thinking that the high carbon
to nitrogen ratio of straw was possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: having a negative effect on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or on the soil health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry growers also typically use
cultivation to deal with their weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of herbicides target broadleaf
perennial plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, strawberries are also
broadleaf perennial plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of using herbicides,
they often will just cultivate until their
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there have been a lot of studies
showing that cultivation can have a
[SPEAKER_05]: negative impact on soil biology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, we're looking again at a study
from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the two treatments to your left are
no-till treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the two treatments to your right,
these are conventionally tilled
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to point out that the
no-till treatments have a lot more fungal
[SPEAKER_05]: hyphae than the conventionally tilled
treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can just see that tilling can
decrease soil biological life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore, we thought maybe that the
high intensity of tilling of strawberry
[SPEAKER_05]: fields was also having a negative effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did is we designed an
experiment out here in East Ithaca where
[SPEAKER_05]: we had four different soil amendment
treatments along a carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_05]: ratio scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see sawdust had a very high
carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then straw was somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then grass had a very low carbon to
nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also had an unamended control.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put those amendments on the soil in
fall of 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we tilled them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the spring of 2014,
we planted honeyway strawberries on that
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make it clear that this is not
what a grower would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: A grower would just simply plant their
strawberries directly into the field in
[SPEAKER_05]: the spring and then apply that straw for
winter protection in the late fall,
[SPEAKER_05]: early summer, and then would rake that
straw into the rows in the next spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as they tilled, that would
eventually become a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we wanted, since I'm only going to be
here for two and a half years,
[SPEAKER_05]: we wanted to get a little bit of a jump
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we applied the amendments to the soil
right away to try to see if we could make
[SPEAKER_05]: differences in our soil health indicators
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we, this is your, he was
department chair at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what a typical department chair
does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready, Steve, to do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, so we had two different
tillage treatments as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tilled half of our plots as shallow as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we tilled half of our plots about
a foot deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can see us tilling with the,
what is it, the Reggie Weeder Rotary
[SPEAKER_05]: Cultivator.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a picture of our plot map.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the four different soil
amendments that we added are indicated by
[SPEAKER_05]: the different colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got unamended treatments in blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got grass amended treatments in
green.
[SPEAKER_05]: Straw amended treatments in that brown
color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sawdust amended treatments in
purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we hatched the plots that are,
that were deep tilled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the ones that aren't hatched are
shallow tilled treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to give you a quick timeline of
what we did so that just to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone's on the same page.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we applied these, we applied these
soil amendments in the fall of 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we let them over winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't take the first soil sample until
the next May.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we planted our strawberries after
our first soil sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we took our second and third soil
samples and again applied more amendments
[SPEAKER_05]: in the fall of 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: We let those over winter and then in May
again we took a fourth soil sample,
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested the berries in June of 2015,
and then took our fifth soil sample in
[SPEAKER_05]: August.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't want to confound our amendment
study by putting straw on for winter
[SPEAKER_05]: protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of using straw, we used row
cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to make sure that you know that
we didn't use straw even though growers
[SPEAKER_05]: often do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can also use row cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every time we took a soil sample,
we looked at five different soil
[SPEAKER_05]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a soil respiration test.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a potentially mineralizable
nitrogen test, a carbon to nitrogen ratio
[SPEAKER_05]: test, pH, and soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then before I start talking about
data, there's one more thing that I wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: to explain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't sure if we should sample
between the rows where we were actually
[SPEAKER_05]: applying the amendments and we were
actually cultivating, or if we should
[SPEAKER_05]: sample within the rows where the
strawberries were actually growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't sure which would have a
greater effect on the soil health
[SPEAKER_05]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did is we sampled in both and
kept them separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why when you look at these
tables, you see an amendment treatment and
[SPEAKER_05]: then a tillage depth treatment,
and then you see a sample location
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't have a sample location
treatment this first sample date because
[SPEAKER_05]: we didn't have any strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there weren't any rows to sample
between or within.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just sampled that date.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for all the rest of the dates,
there's this additional sample location
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment, which indicates whether we
sampled between the rows or within the
[SPEAKER_05]: rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here we're looking at our
respiration data.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the five different sample
dates all the way to the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got not significant data is
indicated all the way to the right here
[SPEAKER_05]: with an NS.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these are P values that we've
showed you that are significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that amendment often has a
significant effect on soil respiration,
[SPEAKER_05]: but tillage depth does not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also see a slight interaction effect
between the amendment and the sample
[SPEAKER_05]: location here on the second date.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: We take a look at the graph here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see on our y-axis, we've got the
milliliters of CO2 respired.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then down here on the x-axis,
we've got each sample date.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the first sample date,
we only have between data because we
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't have rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every other sample date,
we have both between and within.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within is kind of a little bit grayer
if that helps you see this graph a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got our four different soil
amendments, unamended, grass, straw,
[SPEAKER_05]: and sawdust.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we noticed that sawdust often had
higher respiration than any of the other
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you remember from that chart,
the second sample date had an interaction
[SPEAKER_05]: effect between the soil amendment and the
sample location.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see that within, straw had the
highest respiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: But between the rows, straw and sawdust
had actually the same respiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we get that interaction
effect coming into play.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought this was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were a little concerned because
we're adding sawdust.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sawdust has a really high carbon to
nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're adding an amendment with a lot of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd think, well, obviously we can get
more carbon dioxide if we're adding more
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon to the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we decided we were going to try to fix
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we changed our y-axis from total
milliliters of carbon dioxide emitted to
[SPEAKER_05]: grams of carbon respired per gram of
carbon in the soil because we had measured
[SPEAKER_05]: the carbon in the soil as well for each
sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the same chart, but with a
different y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see that the graph looks pretty
much the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually we still have the highest
respiration in our sawdust amendment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we took a look at our potentially
mineralizable nitrogen data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see that, once again,
tillage depth had no significant effect on
[SPEAKER_05]: any of our potentially mineralizable
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But amendment did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it mostly had an effect in the two
springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a slight amendment and sample
location interaction effect in the summer
[SPEAKER_05]: of 2015.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we look at that graphically,
again, that first sample date,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see high potentially mineralizable,
again, in the sawdust amended treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kind of lined up with our
respiration data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the second spring, we didn't see
that same lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see that sawdust does have high
respiration, but it is tied with the grass
[SPEAKER_05]: and the straw amended soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like I mentioned, we had that
slight interaction effect on the final
[SPEAKER_05]: sample date.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that between and within had
slightly different responses for
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially mineralizable nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we now look at our carbon and
nitrogen data, there is no real
[SPEAKER_05]: significant effect of any of our
treatments on carbon and nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason this is really interesting
is because even though we were adding soil
[SPEAKER_05]: amendments with vastly different carbon
and nitrogen ratios to our soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: it wasn't coming through in the soil
itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we had continued this study for many
years, or if we had added vastly more of
[SPEAKER_05]: our soil amendment, we might expect to see
that carbon to nitrogen ratio differ
[SPEAKER_05]: between the treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently, the amount that we added
for the time that we added it,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was no difference in that ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also really interesting because
remember, if you remember back to
[SPEAKER_05]: respiration, we changed our respiration
y-axis from total milliliters of carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: dioxide to grams of carbon emitted through
respiration per gram of carbon in the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see that there was no real
difference between our different soil
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments in the amount of carbon and
nitrogen that was in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though we made that conversion,
since we didn't see differences in carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: and nitrogen ratio data, we didn't really
see any differences in those two graphs
[SPEAKER_05]: when we changed the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be part of the reason why
the respiration looked the same either way
[SPEAKER_05]: we looked at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we looked at pH, there were no
differences in pH based on any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments that we applied.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when we looked between the rows
and within the rows, we could see
[SPEAKER_05]: differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at first, this sample right here,
they were the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, after that, within the rows had
lower pH than between the rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this makes sense because when we
fertilized, we used urea and we did banded
[SPEAKER_05]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't broadcast the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just put it right next to the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And urea can slightly acidify your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're seeing part of that
effect here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, when plants uptake nutrients,
they can emit some acidic compounds and
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly acidify the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the combination of those two
is the reason why we're seeing more acidic
[SPEAKER_05]: soil within the rows than between.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of cool to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil moisture, again, we look and we don't
really see any pattern of differences
[SPEAKER_05]: based on our different treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some significant effects,
but it was not consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't really say much about soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think this might just have to do to the
fact that soil moisture is pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can change from day to day and from
location to location depending upon what
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil, what it's covered with and who's
drawing moisture out of that soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't really see much of interest
with soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first question that we really
wanted to answer was, do soil amendments
[SPEAKER_05]: and tillage depth have an effect on soil
biological health indicators?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can say yes and no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, amendment had an effect on
respiration and potential mineralizable
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen, but tillage depth didn't really
have an effect on any of our soil health
[SPEAKER_05]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also wanted to look at yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you guys remember back to the
timeline that I showed, the yield,
[SPEAKER_05]: we only harvested the berries once.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we only have one set of yield data,
just to keep that in the back of your
[SPEAKER_05]: mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here you can see our amendment and our
depth treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tried to see if there was an effect
on the marketable yield and the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: density.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that there is both an
effect of amendment on marketable yield
[SPEAKER_05]: and plant density.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we come down here and we look at our
marketable yield, straw had a
[SPEAKER_05]: significantly lower yield than any of the
other amendments that we added to our
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, as well as it had significantly
lower plant density than any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: amendments that we added to the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was surprising because, well,
first of all, it's not along that carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: to nitrogen ratio scale that we had at
first thought was going to be the issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought that if straw had lower yields,
that sawdust would have even lower yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that didn't seem to be the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: And straw is also what growers typically
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they might not realize that they're not
producing strawberries to the fullest
[SPEAKER_05]: potential yield that they could get.
[SPEAKER_05]: We calculated it, and it was about a 20%
loss in profits and yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could even see it out in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is not the best picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look here, this is a straw
amended plot, as well as here,
[SPEAKER_05]: here, there, and some right over in that
corner there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really hard to see the plants in
those plots.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're kind of easy to pick
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's true that the straw is kind of
mounted up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that may be one reason why you can't
see the plants very well in this picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, the plants were very short and
small.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another reason why you can't
see the plants so well in this picture in
[SPEAKER_05]: the straw amended plots.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at it this way, it might be a
little easier to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle, we have our straw amended
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bottom, we have our unamended soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the top, we have our sawdust
amended soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all these plants were planted on the
same day and the same distance apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty visually clear that the
straw amended soil produced smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grew slower than the rest of the
unamended and the sawdust amended
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments, as well as the grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: But grass, we expected to have good
growth, because it had a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we didn't expect straw to actually
decrease growth, which it seemed to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: because our unamended soil had better
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: than the straw amended soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's even one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the hypotheses of why we
name strawberries strawberries,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we grow them in straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we're going to have to
rename them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to get to that question in
two slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing I wanted to point out
is that even though we saw these decreased
[SPEAKER_05]: yields and we saw the decreased density,
we are not going to recommend to growers
[SPEAKER_05]: currently that they should stop using
straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you remember at the beginning,
straw has a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: It insulates the berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it provides that nice,
thick mulch layer between the soil and the
[SPEAKER_05]: berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that not only decreases diseases,
it also keeps the berries clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here on our y-axis now, this is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have grams of unmarketable
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that our unmarketable
strawberries in the straw were much lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I had shown you total yield data two
slides ago, or I think three slides ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: the differences between the straw and the
sawdust and the grass and the treatments
[SPEAKER_05]: would have been much greater.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see how much straw decreased
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it still has a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also see it keeping the strawberry
up off the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see the soil in this picture,
because there's a nice, thick layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really important for berry
growers before they ship, for when they
[SPEAKER_05]: ship their berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we don't think that it's okay to have
reduced yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tried this past winter to figure out
what it was that was decreasing yield,
[SPEAKER_05]: what mechanism in the straw was actually
causing this decreased yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came up with a couple different ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first being, just like Jane pointed
out, we thought maybe it's a chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: leachate, because wheat straw has been
shown to have allelopathic effects on
[SPEAKER_05]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also were thinking maybe it was some
kind of microbial community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the straw was encouraging a
microbial community to grow there that was
[SPEAKER_05]: actually detrimental to strawberry plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought that maybe there was like a
physical barrier, like when the strawberry
[SPEAKER_05]: plants were sending out their daughter
plants, their runners, and then the
[SPEAKER_05]: daughter plants were trying to send down
those roots, but the roots couldn't make
[SPEAKER_05]: it to the soil quick enough, and that was
decreasing growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we thought maybe there was some kind of
herbicide residue left over on that straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was then affecting those strawberry
plants, because like we mentioned,
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry plants are broadly perennial as
do most herbicides target.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tried all these things in the
greenhouse, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_05]: we weren't actually able to recreate the
negative growth that we saw in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: in the greenhouse, which was a little bit
disappointing, because we really hoped
[SPEAKER_05]: that we'd be able to answer that question,
like what is it in the straw that's
[SPEAKER_05]: causing reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the greenhouse environment and the
outdoor environment are very different,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so it's possible that there was just
some key element out in the field that we
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't recreate in the greenhouse that was
what would have made us been able to
[SPEAKER_05]: answer this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really interesting, and someone
hopefully will answer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do treatments affect yield?
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we can say yes and no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amendments do affect yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Straw can decrease yield, but tillage
didn't have much effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it didn't have any effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing we tried to do is we tried
to correlate our soil health parameters
[SPEAKER_05]: with yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see here all the way to the
left, we have marketable yield,
[SPEAKER_05]: and along the top, we have our five
different soil health parameters,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were hoping that some of them would
be highly correlated, but we didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: see any pattern.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have anything to say about how
soil health can directly affect yield at
this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our soil health indicators correlated
with yield, we haven't been able to show
[SPEAKER_05]: that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, yield falls under this
human support and that soil functionality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really fall under ecosystem
sustainability or helping to maintain air
[SPEAKER_05]: and water quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can still be increasing our soil
health overall, but not increasing yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important because we planted
strawberries in a soil that hadn't had
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries planted in it for many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty good soil, and all of our
plants overall grew very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there wasn't a lot of diseases built up
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't a lot of pests,
strawberry-specific pests living in the
[SPEAKER_05]: area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our system wasn't very stressed,
and it'd be really interesting to see what
[SPEAKER_05]: happened when the system did become
stressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when healthy soil might really help
increase yields or keep yields high,
[SPEAKER_05]: where an unhealthy soil would kind of drop
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we think that maybe with time,
these effects might become more clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to quickly go over,
kind of highlight what we found in the
[SPEAKER_05]: study, because there was kind of a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little bit all over the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to reiterate, soil amendments do affect
soil health indicators, but not based on
[SPEAKER_05]: that carbon to nitrogen ratio scale like
we originally thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they had, then sawdust would have had
the highest respiration and the highest
[SPEAKER_05]: PMN, and then grass amended soil would
have had the lowest, but that's not what
[SPEAKER_05]: we always saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tilling did not affect the soil health
indicators in our study.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it was only a two-year study,
and most tilling experiments are
[SPEAKER_05]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were hoping that the soil health
parameters would react so quickly to these
[SPEAKER_05]: management practices, that they would kind
of give us a heads up that it was maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: degrading our soil biological health,
but it didn't appear to do that in the
[SPEAKER_05]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be interesting to see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that pH was higher between the rows
than it was within the rows, which was
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And soil amendments do affect yield,
but again, not based on that carbon to
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen ratio scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sawdust or straw had the lowest yield,
but sawdust did not have even lower,
[SPEAKER_05]: or grass did not have even higher yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, tilling did not affect yield,
but like we mentioned, this is only a
[SPEAKER_05]: two-year study, and most tilling
experiments are long-term.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be interesting to see what
happens in the long-term.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were unable to find a link between soil
health and yield, but over time,
[SPEAKER_05]: when more stressors enter the environment,
we might be able to find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though straw decreased strawberry
growth and yield, we were unable to figure
[SPEAKER_05]: out exactly what it was about the straw
that was decreasing growth, and so we're
[SPEAKER_05]: not going to recommend that growers stop
using straw altogether yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if they want to try using a little
less straw in certain parts of their
[SPEAKER_05]: field, although they have to make sure
they put enough on there to adequately
[SPEAKER_05]: insulate, or if they want to try using
some straw in another amendment in
[SPEAKER_05]: conjunction with the straw, maybe that
would be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But until we know, we can't really say
what it is that you need to change to get
[SPEAKER_05]: your yield back up to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quickly before I finish, I just wanted
to thank everyone who helped make this
[SPEAKER_05]: research possible, because I certainly
couldn't have done it on my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: First and foremost, I want to thank
Marvin, who's my advisor, and then
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone who works with him, both Casper
and Kathy was a huge part of this
[SPEAKER_05]: research, and she's greatly missed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also need to really thank you,
Thomas, and his lab, because he let me use
[SPEAKER_05]: his lab space, and with his lab space come
Kelly and Akio, who are his technicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: who also really help whenever you have a
soil question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used some lab space in the Cornell
Nutrient Analysis Laboratory, and Tim
[SPEAKER_05]: Dodge really helped to keep those
strawberries alive when they needed to be
[SPEAKER_05]: watered.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have done it without funding
from both the Hatch and the Horticulture
[SPEAKER_05]: Department.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks to you, graduate students,
and the SIPS departments, but mostly
[SPEAKER_05]: Horticulture, and also my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have some time for
questions, but not too much, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that for that field?
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you tell us what the measurements
like soil organic matter or whatever?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first test was just to kind of show
you what the Cornell Soil Health Lab does,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we didn't use the Cornell Soil Health
Lab to do our test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were really interested in doing
a respiration test, and at the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't include that, but now they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of chose our own soil health
parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we did CDAN ratio, respiration,
PMN.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have those specific tests that
would have been wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that how that was handled?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two questions, Maria.
[SPEAKER_03]: First is, how much straw or sawdust or
grass did you apply?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we used the amount of strawberries that
were typically applied, which I think was
[SPEAKER_05]: like two tons, three tons an acre,
to insulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we dried that, weighed it,
and then we added an equivalent mass basis
[SPEAKER_05]: for sawdust and grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second question is, on the unmarketable
yield, straw treatment had lower
[SPEAKER_03]: unmarketable yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on a percentage basis, would that be
the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or still lower?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I ran that, but I don't
think it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be a good idea to express
the data on a percentage basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the feedback, but I don't have
a pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else have any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: What threshold were you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the marketable berry?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, we were like, well,
you can market a berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't market a berry that has disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this summer, we had a lot of disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, if you remember June,
it rained almost every day, or maybe every
[SPEAKER_05]: other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything that was rotten, we said that
was unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of slugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anytime there was slug damage,
that was not OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the berry was broken in any way from
someone stepping in, stepping on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if it had cracked, that was not OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the time, we were like,
oh, if it's dirty, that's probably OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we included dirty berries in our
marketable yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we probably shouldn't have,
because in reality, although the berry is
[SPEAKER_05]: intact, and it's fine, it doesn't have any
disease, it doesn't have any cuts,
[SPEAKER_05]: it probably would be hard for a grower to
market it, because they have to wash it
[SPEAKER_05]: and then sell it immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you'd have to market only you pick
people who are OK with the berries that
[SPEAKER_05]: then they take home and wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the berries were fine competing,
but they weren't really good for wetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass used as a mulch or as organic
matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that first fall in 2013, we
incorporated that right into the soil to
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of get a jump start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was more of an amendment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next fall, instead of tilling
those amendments in, we just left them on
[SPEAKER_05]: the surface of the soil, trying to kind of
emulate what our strawberry grower would
[SPEAKER_05]: do, because they wouldn't till them into
the soil until the next spring when they
[SPEAKER_05]: needed to weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just left them on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next spring when we needed to
weed, that's when it kind of came from a
[SPEAKER_05]: mulch into an amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they don't produce them quite
the same way that they do in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of a different system.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they do use black plastic mulch,
so that's an important option.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they still use straw between the
rows, because it's also nice just for if
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to pick for people to walk on.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are strawberry growers normally growing
strawberries in the same field for many
[SPEAKER_01]: years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how often do they replace them?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll replace their strawberry plants
maybe after three or four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when it's not economical anymore to
keep them, because every time they produce
[SPEAKER_05]: berries, they'll produce a little bit
smaller or a little less the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The recommendation is that they rotate
after that three or four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in reality, that doesn't always
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times they do keep their field in
the same spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just like to grow their strawberries
in this one spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some do, they probably should,
some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible that the straw is keeping
the soil temperature a little bit lower in
[SPEAKER_00]: that treatment compared to the others?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in the greenhouse, it doesn't seem
as effective as the average temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean that, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, straw was most likely keeping it
temperature lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't measure soil temperature,
but from other literature that I've read,
[SPEAKER_05]: it usually does keep the soil temperature
lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the greenhouse, yeah,
the temperature was regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have those pots, and they're
sitting up high, so it could have
[SPEAKER_05]: something to do with soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in the greenhouse, we worked hard
to, we've got longer, deeper pots,
[SPEAKER_05]: and tried to plant the strawberries a
little lower without them being too low
[SPEAKER_05]: into the pot, and then piling the mulch on
top.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we probably didn't get the same amount
of mulch that we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were able to get on the field where you
could just really pile it on there,
[SPEAKER_05]: which a grower typically does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might also have to do with the
amount of straw that we used in the
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for vegetables and rural crops,
they're really pushing this Cornell soil
[SPEAKER_02]: health test.
[SPEAKER_02]: For orchard systems and vineyards,
vineyard systems, we've had a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: really showing that suite of tests really
tells us very much about soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for strawberries, strawberry growers,
should they be using the soil test?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, is there a modification that
you would think would be useful to add to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cornell test to make it useful for
strawberry growers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so that was kind of what originally
motivated this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, should this be used for berry
growers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get them excited about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it even need anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we were really hoping at
the end to correlate these soil health
[SPEAKER_05]: parameters and yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that there are probably
benefits to the soil health test.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we gave the soil health test to all
those berry growers, their chemical and
[SPEAKER_05]: their physical soil parameters all came
back in the greens, a few yellows mixed in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were all fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was when you went to the biological
components, that's when we got,
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw the red and then we saw the really
low value scores.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that a grower sees their
chemical and their physical components on
[SPEAKER_05]: a regular basis when they take their soil
test.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they see that and they can manage
their soil for those components.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they never test the biological
components, so they can't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't see how they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I think that soil health
is something that is still somewhat new
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe not within the science
community, but when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: translate it from talking about it and
developing a test to actually implementing
[SPEAKER_05]: that test as a grower in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that there's gonna be a lot
of modifications that will have to be made
[SPEAKER_05]: to the soil test that are available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know the best indicators
because selecting those indicators is
[SPEAKER_05]: really critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's a lot of developments
being made, especially in soil
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that hopefully those will
trickle down and those kind of tests will
[SPEAKER_05]: become less expensive and more negative of
how the soil biological community kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: really is looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now we're just doing,
is there a lot or is there a little?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really crude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be better if we could do,
what is there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it antagonistic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it protagonistic?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that those will get better with
time, but right now we need the data to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to make that better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want people to get on board.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that when we look back in 50
years, we'll be like, whoa, those tests
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.
