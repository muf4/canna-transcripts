[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good morning, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Larry Smart, I'm a professor in
the horticulture section in the School of
[SPEAKER_21]: Integrated Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_21]: This year, just to give you an overview of
the agenda, and I did print out enough
[SPEAKER_21]: hard copies of the agenda for everyone,
but there is a QR code that will take you
[SPEAKER_21]: online, and we have the agenda and all of
our handouts are online because we do that
[SPEAKER_21]: because I used to print out 125 or 150
handouts and end up with 100 left over at
[SPEAKER_21]: the end.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we do have 25 hard copy printouts of
our handouts, and we'll be distributing
[SPEAKER_21]: those as each speaker comes up to the mic,
and if you do want to look at a hard copy
[SPEAKER_21]: handout, you know, share and look over
each other's shoulders.
[SPEAKER_21]: So in the morning, we are going to talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to start with our update from
New York State Ag and Markets,
[SPEAKER_21]: Tim Sweeney, who's our program director,
and then we will talk about this variety
[SPEAKER_21]: trial, and then we will shift down to the
next stop and talk about some
[SPEAKER_21]: establishment management techniques,
seed treatments, weed management,
[SPEAKER_21]: and rolling, and then hopefully the Bish
fiber cut is running.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we will see how well that's working.
[SPEAKER_21]: So then we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Magic Kowalski is here from Poland.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's going to talk about some of the
different aspects of redding, in
[SPEAKER_21]: particular for textile fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we will have a pretty cool demo of a
Monarch electric tractor.
[SPEAKER_21]: And finally, we'll end up the morning
demonstrating our McHale baler.
[SPEAKER_21]: So then we will all drive down to our new
hemp processing facility that we call the
[SPEAKER_21]: HempTent.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a fabric barn, and we will have a
delicious Rusty Pig lunch in the HempTent.
[SPEAKER_21]: And in the afternoon, we will see if we
can get our decorticators running,
[SPEAKER_21]: and then we'll end the day with an array
of hemp individuals and industry
[SPEAKER_21]: professionals and entrepreneurs from New
York State.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I hope it's a stimulating event.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a lot of people from across the
country here attending, academics,
[SPEAKER_21]: industry members, processing folks.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it should be a nice networking event.
[SPEAKER_21]: The last thing I want to say is that
everything may not go great, but we've
[SPEAKER_21]: broken a lot of stuff in the last week and
have been scrambling, especially my new
[SPEAKER_21]: research support specialist, Jacob Bisch,
has been putting in long hours trying to
[SPEAKER_21]: get things repaired in time for today.
[SPEAKER_21]: They may not work perfectly, but it will
be real.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it may not be great, but it will be
real.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that reflects where we are in the hemp
industry right now, especially on the
[SPEAKER_21]: processing side.
[SPEAKER_21]: So bear with us.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have some suggestions to make
things work, let us know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to hand over the mic to
our longstanding and good friend at New
[SPEAKER_21]: York State Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have been incredibly supportive of
our research programs.
[SPEAKER_21]: But Tim also manages our hemp growers,
and he's going to give you a little update
[SPEAKER_05]: and answer any questions you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll be the first thing that may not
work great.
[SPEAKER_18]: My presentation's on a PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have no screens.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've been running the hemp licensing
program since 2022.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the current iteration of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's no longer a pilot program.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are granted that authority by the
USDA.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hemp still remains a heavily regulated
crop, and you must be licensed by the
[SPEAKER_18]: state in order to grow it.
[SPEAKER_18]: The license fee is $500, and you have to
have a FBI background check.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can have no felony drug-related
convictions within the last 10 years in
[SPEAKER_18]: order to get a license.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you do, you would be disqualified.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to take a lot of time going
through the minutiae of the program,
[SPEAKER_18]: because I don't think there's probably a
lot of growers here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Larry, I'm sorry, I'm here with Chuck
Schmidt, my colleague somewhere around.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be here all day.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have any particular questions,
if you are a grower, you can hunt us down,
[SPEAKER_18]: and we will talk to you one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you are a licensed grower, there are
some things that you need to remember.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you haven't yet done a planting report,
you need to get that into us.
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to be in by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're supposed to be in within 20 days
of planting.
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you're not planting, you still
have to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a box to check that says you're
not planting, but if you don't get it into
[SPEAKER_18]: us, you run the risk of having to enter
into a corrective action plan,
[SPEAKER_18]: which is just a lot more paperwork for
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, if you are a grower and you're about
to harvest, you need to submit the
[SPEAKER_18]: pre-harvest report with us.
[SPEAKER_18]: They need to be sent in 30 days before
your intended harvest date, and then you
[SPEAKER_18]: would, on that form, you would choose your
sampling agent and a lab that will do your
[SPEAKER_18]: testing for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: We no longer do the sampling and testing
as an agency.
[SPEAKER_18]: We just don't have the capacity.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is the grower's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have 28, I believe, certified sampling
agents and 24 recognized labs that you can
[SPEAKER_18]: work with to fill those responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the grower's license is good for three
years.
[SPEAKER_18]: The $500 fee you pay is good for a
three-year license.
[SPEAKER_18]: And since the program started in 2022,
that means that licenses are going to be
[SPEAKER_18]: expiring next year.
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll start to expire.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a grower, you'll be getting a
90-day advance notice that you need to get
[SPEAKER_18]: your license renewed.
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be doing individualized
notification to everybody as their license
[SPEAKER_18]: comes up 90 days out.
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, I checked with the
USDA.
[SPEAKER_18]: You do have to do another background check
for the new license.
[SPEAKER_18]: The background check can be no more than
60 days old when you apply, when you send
[SPEAKER_18]: in your application.
[SPEAKER_18]: Applications have to be mailed in.
[SPEAKER_18]: They can't be taken electronically for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_18]: They won't let us do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's another $500 fee for the renewal.
[SPEAKER_18]: These are just caveats that I say every
year.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're planning to grow hemp,
know where you're going to sell the hemp.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a market before you plant the stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have people every year, they plant
it, then they call us at harvest time,
[SPEAKER_18]: what am I going to do with this?
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't broker hemp.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have a way to set you up with
buyers.
[SPEAKER_18]: So know where you're going to sell it
before you plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, zoning is a local issue in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check the zoning where you're going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't grow in a residential area
unless it's also zoned for agricultural
[SPEAKER_18]: uses.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't grow in a residence or an
attached garage.
[SPEAKER_18]: Know the characteristics of the plants
you're growing, of the varieties you're
[SPEAKER_18]: growing.
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's got a tendency to go hot,
stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if it goes hot, it's not going to
be any good to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have to destroy it or remediate it
in some way.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the remediation pretty much makes it
invaluable.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not of any value.
[SPEAKER_18]: And because we're still operating under
the 2018 farm bill, we have not had a new
[SPEAKER_18]: farm bill yet.
[SPEAKER_18]: The 0.3 total THC remains the standard for
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_18]: No more than 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were hoping for a farm bill last year.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we're going to get one this
year.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see if next year, if we get a
farm bill, perhaps there will be some
[SPEAKER_18]: changes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard of anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does New York exempt certified varieties
from compliance testing?
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a list of varieties, yes,
that are exempted from testing.
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the potential of being inspected
once in your three-year period.
[SPEAKER_18]: You will be inspected sometimes more.
[SPEAKER_18]: The sampling, certain varieties can be
exempted from it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Others will not.
[SPEAKER_18]: If they have a tendency to be kind of hot,
as they've been hot in the past,
[SPEAKER_19]: you're going to have to sample those.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the question is, when do we sample for
compliance testing?
[SPEAKER_18]: 30 days out from your anticipated date of
harvest, send in your pre-harvest report
[SPEAKER_18]: with the name of your sampling agent.
[SPEAKER_18]: We then generate a chain of custody form
that would get sent to your sampling
[SPEAKER_18]: agent.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they would call you.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd set up your sampling date.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's 30 days out.
[SPEAKER_18]: 30 days out from your anticipated harvest
is when the sample's taken.
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, is it total THC?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it's total THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, Chuck and I are here most all
day.
[SPEAKER_18]: So hunt us down if you have other
questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: Pat, I have one final question.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if a field exceeds THC, exceeds the
0.3% limit, you have the option to
[SPEAKER_21]: remediate it and retest it, right?
[SPEAKER_21]: One of my colleagues told me that that
remediation, retesting and remediation
[SPEAKER_21]: does not apply if you are growing for seed
for planting.
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_14]: Chuck?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd say seed crops generally don't go hot.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the CBD crops are what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did have a seed crop go hot last
year.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we did let him harvest that.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think we probably would take that on
a case by case basis and see what
[SPEAKER_18]: varieties they're talking about,
how hot it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: To remediate it, we'd have to chop it up
pretty much and make it a whole genius
[SPEAKER_18]: mess and see what had been lost.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we didn't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did allow that to go.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to not, we want people to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't want to get people unnecessarily
in trouble or have to destroy their crop
[SPEAKER_18]: for many new problems, but we are
beholding to the USDA if we get audited
[SPEAKER_18]: and we have something wrong, we could
threaten the whole program.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, and you also, like I said,
make sure you're not growing varieties
[SPEAKER_18]: that tend to go hot because if a field is
hot, it will have to be destroyed if it
[SPEAKER_18]: can't be remedied.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you haven't sent in your planting,
your pre-harvest report, you've harvested
[SPEAKER_18]: it without it being sampled, it will be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_21]: You mean if it tests hot?
[SPEAKER_21]: If it tests hot, can you use the material
as a source for biochar?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, if you could, whatever you do with
the biochar to make the hemp irretrievable
[SPEAKER_18]: and not usable for illicit purposes,
yeah, I think that'd be okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, what was the question?
[SPEAKER_21]: What is the means of remediation?
[SPEAKER_19]: Chuck, you want to handle that one?
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for remediation, we generally ask
that the flower be removed and then the
[SPEAKER_19]: remainder of the crop be chopped up into a
biomass.
[SPEAKER_19]: The flower can be chopped up in that as
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you dilute it with all the leaf
material, non-stem material.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you send another sample to the
lab and most likely it's going to be
[SPEAKER_19]: tested fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: The problem is, now you have this product
you have to sell.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you do with that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have like a window of days that has
to be remediated?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, like anything else, you know,
once we find it hot, we've got 10 days to
[SPEAKER_19]: tell us what we're going to do with it,
we're going to talk to you and talk about
[SPEAKER_19]: some of the options that you have.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay,
great.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks very much, Tim.
[SPEAKER_21]: So growing, yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have been incredible partners.
[SPEAKER_21]: They are our partners in this endeavor.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as Tim said, they want to see farmers
succeed.
[SPEAKER_21]: But having said that, evaluating the
cultivars that you're growing and my
[SPEAKER_21]: advice would be to grow compliant
cultivars, cultivars that have a long
[SPEAKER_21]: history of being compliant under the
current rules.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is something that we have been
doing in our field trials for the last
[SPEAKER_21]: seven years is evaluating varieties,
testing them for compliance and doing the
[SPEAKER_21]: fundamental research to understand the
genetics of why those varieties produce
[SPEAKER_21]: THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we've been pretty successful
at that.
[SPEAKER_21]: It is now really critical that you grow
compliant varieties if you want to enter
[SPEAKER_21]: hemp seed meal into the animal feed
market.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that has been an incredible event in
the hemp industry is federal approval,
[SPEAKER_21]: AFCO and FDA approval of hemp seed meal as
a feed ingredient for laying hens.
[SPEAKER_21]: With the caveat being that that feed
definition has some pretty low limits for
[SPEAKER_21]: THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that hemp seed meal cannot have greater
than two parts per million total THC or
[SPEAKER_21]: more than 20 parts per million total THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously those seeds are not making THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: It would be residue that would be rubbing
off in the bin of the combine or through
[SPEAKER_21]: the harvesting process.
[SPEAKER_21]: But right from the outset, you want to be
growing varieties that produce low amounts
[SPEAKER_21]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: This year, you're going to see that our
field day is really focused on fiber.
[SPEAKER_21]: And a lot of those fiber varieties do
produce THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's not an issue for the hemp seed
meal, obviously.
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's something that my graduate
student Luis Monserrate is going to talk
[SPEAKER_21]: about.
[SPEAKER_21]: So Luis is going to give you about a 15
minute overview of 15 or 20 minute
[SPEAKER_21]: overview of his research and the trial
behind him.
[SPEAKER_21]: Find me here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we want to give you some time to
walk through the trial, ask any questions,
[SPEAKER_21]: follow up with Luis on things that he's
saying.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we are going to meet at that
speaker over there at 950.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: So Luis, it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great to see you all again.
[SPEAKER_12]: I recognize many familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great attendance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that good?
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I always ask this question when I give
my talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who in here is wearing or has any hemp
fiber piece of clothing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, lower than last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ever need a good hat, I would
highly recommend this hemp hat by Tiley.
[SPEAKER_12]: By Tiley, I believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: 100% hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will encourage the industry once
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so my name is Luis Monserrate.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm starting my fourth year in this PhD
program with Larry, focusing on fiber and
[SPEAKER_12]: grain breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you saw yesterday at the USDA,
characterization of genoplasm is
[SPEAKER_12]: important.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to do any of the breeding and
genetics, we need to explore these
[SPEAKER_12]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to characterize them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to characterize phenotypically and
genotypically.
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now, I want to show you my
phenotypic characterization here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this characterization is not new.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been done for many years.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm not mistaken, a century ago,
Luis started doing this in 1920s,
[SPEAKER_12]: 1912, I believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he started characterizing genoplasm
from Italy, from China.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he started introducing some of those
traits in that genoplasm.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the Netherlands, in 1994, they did
something similar, assessing 163
[SPEAKER_12]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was a multi-site trial.
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2020, I believe, they assessed 123
accessions.
[SPEAKER_12]: The same university, Wageningen
University.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they did an international assessment
comparing performance in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_12]: in Italy, and in France.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is not new, but this is very
imperative to know how they could do a
[SPEAKER_12]: performance and what are the interesting
traits there are.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, characterization is important.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the USDA, you saw very cool traits.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you walk around the field, you saw
certain interesting phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_12]: certain traits, certain leaves,
certain fluorescence, and certain munishi.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what we are seeing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also assessing that in a production
scale instead of a high planted density,
[SPEAKER_12]: how the cultivar will perform in a
commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_12]: To do that, we decided to do a dual that
is on your right side and a fiber that is
[SPEAKER_12]: on your left side.
[SPEAKER_12]: The fiber was planted at a density of 1.87
million plants per acre, I believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: 1.31 million plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the dual was of 182.
[SPEAKER_12]: 1,000 plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I used metric units on time to
convert to the imperial system.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so as you can see, the stem count is
very important for us because for fiber,
[SPEAKER_12]: we want to minimize the stem diameter.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have heard from processors that they
don't want something that is thicker than
[SPEAKER_12]: an inch or something that is the diameter
of a pinky.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the dual, what we want is to
maximize the herd production as well as
[SPEAKER_12]: the grain production.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we should actually enable that
branchiness or a little bit of branchiness
[SPEAKER_12]: for the yield of grain.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it is important to know that
there are advantages and disadvantages
[SPEAKER_12]: based on the type of cultivar that you
use, the market classes that you use.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to discuss with you about
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, there are two sexual
differences expressions in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the daishus and the monishus.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have a daishus crop, there are
advantages and disadvantages with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: One daiken that has been approved and
corroborated by a group in Italy from
[SPEAKER_12]: 2022, I believe, they observed that male
plants have a higher fiber quality than
[SPEAKER_12]: females.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that case, when you have a daishus
population, then before the females
[SPEAKER_12]: flower, you, objectively speaking,
should get better fiber yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this assessment has not been done
comparing such yield with a monishus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it makes it challenging because you
have to ensure you have the same genotypic
[SPEAKER_12]: background except the sexual
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for now, we can say that in a daishus
population, the males at least will have a
[SPEAKER_12]: higher fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: With the monishus, the idea is that that
fiber quality should be more homogeneous,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you will, because it will be the same
individual.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, if you walk around and you see a
daishus individual, there will be a few
[SPEAKER_12]: males over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's typical to see between 5% to 10% of
the population having males.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another important characteristic with the
monishus and the daishus is the ease of
[SPEAKER_12]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a daishus population and you
harvest for grain, that will be at seed
[SPEAKER_12]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_12]: By that time, in a daishus population,
the males will be senesced and will be
[SPEAKER_12]: rotted.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is probable that that male will clog
your combine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I heard that before.
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes it happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it wraps up and starts heating
up in the combine, smoking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it could be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why sometimes monishus is
better.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if you look at the monishus
individual, I know and I acknowledge that
[SPEAKER_12]: there are different types of monishus.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are different inflorescence types
when you talk about monishus.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the European monishus, in my opinion,
has these clusters of male flowers that
[SPEAKER_12]: eventually senesce and they stay on the
female plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is decaying material in the
inflorescence, where the grains are going
[SPEAKER_12]: to be harvested for human consumption and
other consumption are going to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is a little microenvironment for a
potential pathogen growth.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe some of you know, if you have
Fusarium gaminarum there, you may have
[SPEAKER_12]: homotoxin there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if that will be the case,
but it's a hypothesis I have that that
[SPEAKER_12]: could be a potential issue with a monishus
individual in that sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other question that I have about the
differences or trade-off is grain yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, we have to ensure that we have
the same genotypic background except the
[SPEAKER_12]: sexual expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: But are monishus plants producing more
yield than a daishus population?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you would think so, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you have more than 50% of the
plants being female.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a monishus population,
you objectively have more grain.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's something that we need to assess
because there are many confounder factors
[SPEAKER_12]: such as late flower and branchiness.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's another thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe monishus.
[SPEAKER_12]: If the plant is genotypically identical,
but it's monishus, maybe it has more
[SPEAKER_12]: grain.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that New West Genetics has kind
of like that general thought a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: with one of their hybrids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another parameter, really important trait
that we characterize and we try to make
[SPEAKER_12]: sense of is the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are advantages and disadvantages
with them, and I would like to discuss
[SPEAKER_12]: those with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for fiber, what do we want?
[SPEAKER_12]: A late flowering, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we want to accumulate as much
stock as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, during the Pennsylvania field
day, I was told that for that specific
[SPEAKER_12]: processor, they don't want more than four
to six feet tall plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you have a taller stem,
you will have more busts running along the
[SPEAKER_12]: main stem.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, you'll start getting more hurt.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you have a late flowering,
you're able to accumulate average growth
[SPEAKER_12]: over time, accumulate more busts.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have an early flowering one,
that would not be the case.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another interesting thing is the ease of
harvest when we're looking at early and
[SPEAKER_12]: late flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a late flowering for grain,
for example, that plant would be very big
[SPEAKER_12]: that you would need very expensive and
very difficult to obtain piece of
[SPEAKER_12]: equipment such as the Hem Flags double
cut, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to have a dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you have an early flowering,
you need a regular combine that you can
[SPEAKER_12]: easily harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: For the fiber, you may need a fiber cut or
a sickle bar.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that you need to reach certain
height for that to work because you're
[SPEAKER_12]: going to have four bars on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: One challenge that we have observed is the
scale ups.
[SPEAKER_12]: Late flowering cultivars and early
flowering also is a very important step or
[SPEAKER_12]: a very important characteristic for us as
breeders to utilize to scale up green
[SPEAKER_12]: lines for cultivars.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a late flowering cultivar,
it makes it really challenging to produce
[SPEAKER_12]: seeds here because by the time that the
seeds are maturing, we have a frost and we
[SPEAKER_12]: lose all our seed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it makes it very difficult when you
flower very late.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then we have to play with other
characteristics either, okay, we can grow
[SPEAKER_12]: at certain latitudes, okay, but you know,
Florida, there's a hurricane, everything
[SPEAKER_12]: goes to hell, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So it makes it very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, there are other parameters that
we can look into such as the juvenile
[SPEAKER_12]: phase of the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have observed that certain germoplasm,
once it's grown, a very short day length,
[SPEAKER_12]: it will take a while to flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't flower in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some do, some do in two weeks,
but some will take a month, 20 days,
[SPEAKER_12]: six weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is very good because it allows us
to have a growth that is big enough for a
[SPEAKER_12]: regular combine to use when it's growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can grow in Yuma, Arizona in
November, September, December.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it makes it, it's a good environment
for it, but not all cultivars perform that
[SPEAKER_12]: way.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to assess germoplasm to see
that juvenile phase or that sensitivity to
[SPEAKER_12]: the critical day length.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just a little sidebar here,
when you're looking at day length,
[SPEAKER_12]: I will encourage you to include the civil
twilight in your measurements.
[SPEAKER_12]: Civil twilight also prevents flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a group art of University of
Florida.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have observed this and reported this,
and I have been able to track down and
[SPEAKER_12]: accurately compare my day length from the
field into a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have observed those.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would encourage you that whenever
you're doing measurements using day
[SPEAKER_12]: length, include the civil twilight time.
[SPEAKER_12]: With competition is another important
phenotype to look into for our germoplasm.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be probably late to early
flowering, but I would say that tilling
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger and leaf area is another important
parameter for the weed competition.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want a germoplasm that will have a
growth rate very high that we're able to
[SPEAKER_12]: compete with the weeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: A leaf area that's going to be very large
that we're able to shade those weeds out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see that in some of those,
like there is no weed whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_12]: But last year we did a spray swan land,
I believe, and we had a very nice weed
[SPEAKER_12]: competition for some cultivars.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one additional trait that I'm looking
into, which I think is very important,
[SPEAKER_12]: and for some of you, maybe more than
obnoxious for me, is seed size.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what we have observed that seed
size does, it seems to be a proxy for
[SPEAKER_12]: seedling bigger.
[SPEAKER_12]: At least the germoplasm that we have used,
that we have tested with large seeds have
[SPEAKER_12]: large leaves, which allow us to compete
with the weeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Preliminarily speaking from a pilot study
that we did, we have observed that larger
[SPEAKER_12]: seeds are able to perform better in
processing for de-hauling.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's good as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do acknowledge that the challenge is
when you're getting a pound of seeds,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're getting fewer seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that the counter-argument for
it is that you will essentially need fewer
[SPEAKER_12]: seeds to reach your stand establishment,
because the seedling view is going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: so high.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you have lower seeds, you need more
seeds in a bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, you will have more seeds in a bag,
but you will use a lot of those seeds and
[SPEAKER_12]: some of those will be self-thin,
or the crop is not going to compete with
[SPEAKER_12]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's going to happen in the harvest?
[SPEAKER_12]: Your bales are going to be full of weeds,
which may decrease the quality,
[SPEAKER_12]: and your seeds may have a lot of weeds,
a lot of weed seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think seed size should be,
I mean, we have one with corn,
[SPEAKER_12]: so I think the same thing can be done with
hemp, and I think it's a good trait to
[SPEAKER_12]: exploring.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm constantly exploring.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what is the other characteristic of
hemp, or phenotype of, yes, phenotype of
[SPEAKER_12]: trait that we care the most?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Tim was very clear about one of
them, that makes hemp hemp, legally
[SPEAKER_12]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_12]: The THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and that's the perfect segue for what
we are going to move on, and that is
[SPEAKER_12]: selection for populating populations,
breeding lines, slash cultivars,
[SPEAKER_12]: that will be consistently below the 0.3%
THC limit per driveway.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we have done for our
breeding lines, Orsa Ulta and Orsa
[SPEAKER_12]: Grandin.
[SPEAKER_12]: You will see all the two here,
1380 and 1143.
[SPEAKER_12]: These cultivars and breeding lines were
actually selected for the production of,
[SPEAKER_12]: for the lack of production of THC,
or to reach a limit below the 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was done with market assisted
selection developed by our lab,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we can assure you that when you are
growing this cultivar by the time of
[SPEAKER_12]: sampling, and you're harvesting,
you are not going to exceed that limit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have consistently observed that,
have been certified by a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and we'll have done the same thing for
1142 and for 1380.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will encourage you all to look at
the handouts, and we can see our potential
[SPEAKER_12]: yield in a small plot trial, and I
understand small plot trial is not a
[SPEAKER_12]: street trial, but we are able to reach
about 20 metric tons per hectare,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is like 8 US tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: For your understanding, the average of
fiber yield last year was reported in the
[SPEAKER_12]: USDA hand report, it was 2 tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was the average.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for Orsa Grandin, which is another
cultivar in this case, we are promoting
[SPEAKER_12]: this as a dual purpose, so we can get
grain out of it as well as the herd,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're able to get about 6 metric tons,
sorry, 6 US tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're able to get 2,000 pounds per
acre of grain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, the average last year was 558
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm giving you these numbers that
should encourage you to pursue hemp and
[SPEAKER_12]: looking into the future, and perhaps
getting interested in our cultivars as
[SPEAKER_12]: well.
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I think more important is to
test this regularly and to observe these
[SPEAKER_12]: yields and these performance consistently
year after year, and not just in the same
[SPEAKER_12]: location, but across the US.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the handout for our grain,
you can see also the yields in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_12]: well, Ithaca, Kentucky, North Carolina,
Texas, and Florida.
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, you can determine what your
potential, your best cultivar could be,
[SPEAKER_12]: not just for fiber, but also for grain.
[SPEAKER_12]: One trait that I feel like I'm forgetting
is the fiber quality one, which is bass
[SPEAKER_12]: content.
[SPEAKER_12]: This bass content has been improved since
1950s, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, you can see one of those,
which is fiber 79.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was reported, well, this yellow stem
or bright stem was identified in the
[SPEAKER_12]: 1950s, if I'm not mistaken, by a German
group.
[SPEAKER_12]: They called it bright stems.
[SPEAKER_12]: This trait is very interesting because
they have observed in 2018, other
[SPEAKER_12]: genoplasm, I think Carmalionti,
are ivory markhant that has produced
[SPEAKER_12]: higher bass content after the corrugation
compared to green stem.
[SPEAKER_12]: In I think 2023, if I'm not mistaken,
another group assessed the performance of
[SPEAKER_12]: fiber 79 with Futura 75, and they observed
a difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they observed that fiber 79 was
37.5% bass content, whereas Futura 75 was
[SPEAKER_12]: 27.5%.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's 29.3%.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have seen crazy numbers as well in other
groups out of Latvia.
[SPEAKER_12]: They observed over 42% bass content,
which is insane, but they have done it,
[SPEAKER_12]: allegedly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, what I'm trying to say here is
that this characterization of cultivars
[SPEAKER_12]: have allowed other people and have allowed
us to improve our yields, to improve the
[SPEAKER_12]: traits that we believe are going to be
more adept for the industry as well as for
[SPEAKER_12]: growers, processors, industry in general.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we are heading that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have more green lines in the pipeline
trying to assess, to ensure that we are
[SPEAKER_12]: not exceeding the limits for hand seed
meal, to have high seed size, a great seed
[SPEAKER_12]: size, to ensure a uniform flowering time,
to make sure that we have that parameter
[SPEAKER_12]: of distinct uniform and stable to meet as
a cultivar, so that we can have that
[SPEAKER_12]: certification of seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess this is all I have to say,
and those are my 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_21]: That does not go hot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Our varieties are essentially zero THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: They will not go hot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Our varieties will be submitted for plant
variety protection this fall.
[SPEAKER_12]: The question is, what's the best time to
harvest for fiber and dual purpose
[SPEAKER_12]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_12]: For fiber, it has been widely researched
for many years in Europe.
[SPEAKER_12]: The ideal time to maximize yield and
minimize quality loss.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is at the onset of female flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're able to have those, to stretch out
your height, your stem length as much as
[SPEAKER_12]: possible, but minimizing the linkification
that happens during female flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I do is because I do not immediately
believe that every single cultivar is
[SPEAKER_12]: 50-50.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just rate percentage of flowering
overall, and whenever I see at least 50%
[SPEAKER_12]: flowering in my population, I decide that
that's time to harvest for fiber.
[SPEAKER_12]: For a dual purpose, it is interesting
because we have more issues, and I have to
[SPEAKER_12]: have a criterion that will fit both of
them.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I do is I rate flowering,
again, on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once I reach 80% flowering, that will
ensure that for a initial population,
[SPEAKER_12]: most of them are flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: For other issues, I have more than half of
the females flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: From that point, I track between six to
eight weeks after that point for seed
[SPEAKER_12]: maturity to harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have observed consistently that it seems
to be around six to eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really change.
[SPEAKER_12]: It changed within those six to eight
weeks, but that's around the time when you
[SPEAKER_12]: try it for dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me just broaden that question a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: The question is about what is so special
about Ursa Alta.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have, using marker-assisted selection
from very late flowering land races from
[SPEAKER_21]: China, we have selected these two
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_21]: We trademark the name Ursa, which is the
Latin name for bear.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's our mascot.
[SPEAKER_21]: All of the varieties that we produce in
our Cornell breeding program will be
[SPEAKER_21]: trademarked with that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ursa name.
[SPEAKER_21]: These first two cultivars were developed
with funding from the Foundation for Food
[SPEAKER_21]: and Agriculture Research and matching
funds from International Hemp.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have been licensed exclusively in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_21]: to International Hemp for distribution and
seed production.
[SPEAKER_21]: We call them Grande.
[SPEAKER_21]: Grande has large seeds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Luis is very fond of large seeds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Alta is an exception.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an exclusive fiber variety.
[SPEAKER_21]: We cannot produce seed of that variety in
New York.
[SPEAKER_21]: Luis, what is so special about Alta?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who of you attended the USDA,
but my lab mate, Lucia Vignale,
[SPEAKER_12]: said that apparently it's resistant to
both Fusarium, sorry, not Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_12]: Sectoria and Parimildi.
[SPEAKER_12]: From her screening, so that's very
encouraging and very exciting to be
[SPEAKER_12]: honest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that makes it special, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the plant also,
to me the leaf area makes it very special
[SPEAKER_12]: because what I believe is that you can
decrease the stem count or the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: density if you still have a good weed
competition and narrow stem.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that leaf area makes it confessional.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's competitive compared to other
commercially available cultivars such as
[SPEAKER_12]: Futura 83.
[SPEAKER_12]: The leaf area is much larger than Futura
83.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say that makes it special as
well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Likewise, Orza Grande is also large,
has large touch leaves.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have not had the opportunity yet to
determine decortication efficiency and
[SPEAKER_21]: vast yield, but we collaborate with David
Suchoff at North Carolina State University
[SPEAKER_21]: and I believe our varieties are among the
highest in vast fiber yield among the
[SPEAKER_21]: varieties that he tested in similar small
trial, small plot trials.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we highly value that collaboration with
North Carolina State and they have an
[SPEAKER_21]: excellent College of Textiles there where
we will be able to assess fiber quality of
[SPEAKER_21]: these new emerging varieties.
[SPEAKER_21]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: You mentioned that you want them very
thin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it because the vast fiber ratio,
is it because the equipment is not there
[SPEAKER_10]: more thicker or is it both?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I would say both.
[SPEAKER_12]: One is because of the ratio.
[SPEAKER_12]: The thicker the stem, the lower the vast
to herd ratio.
[SPEAKER_12]: But also if you have a stem that is a
whole trunk, you will not be able to
[SPEAKER_12]: decorticate.
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I heard from some, I think one
processor was that if the stem is wider
[SPEAKER_12]: than an inch, it will not decorticate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you cannot process a high cannabinoid
stem for example.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's because the equipment is not
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's because of the, I believe
it's because of the vast to herd ratio.
[SPEAKER_12]: You will have more herd than vast and
ultimately also the equipment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tyler.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tyler is asking how I'm harvesting these
plots.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I do is I harvest one square meter
that should be representative of the
[SPEAKER_12]: entire path.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you walk around, you will see some
holes in the middle.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I place my quadrant and
harvest everything in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that allows me to determine a yield
based on that specific one square meter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Question over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: What trace did
you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_12]: The question is.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you use the molecular markers for when
you were reading for the first time?
No.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for marketing selection, we did
chemotype for chemotype three solely.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll have only these two alleles that
will produce mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other selection criterion
that we used was flowering time to make
[SPEAKER_12]: sure that is within one window of,
it doesn't flower like for several weeks,
[SPEAKER_12]: but also like uniformly like, I don't
know, like let's say like in two,
[SPEAKER_12]: three weeks you have everything flowering
or something like that as opposed to
[SPEAKER_12]: flowering over several weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a specific flowering time when we want
those to flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for example, a salt that will be
harvested I believe between early and mid
[SPEAKER_12]: October.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the window that we chose.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So just another point about flowering time
and what we've been harvesting here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So as you drive around, you're going to
see some fields that have already been
[SPEAKER_21]: harvested, redded, raked.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to demonstrate raking and
baling some of those.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to walk down and look at
carminecta where the harvester is.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to run the fiber cut through
that carminecta.
[SPEAKER_21]: And for fiber, that field is all red.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's already gone past.
[SPEAKER_21]: The males have already senesced.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you were harvesting for fiber,
you're too late.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just about perfect right now if you
were going to do a dual purpose harvest
[SPEAKER_21]: because the grain is mature in that
variety.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the French varieties such as future 83
and fiber were ready to harvest what about
[SPEAKER_21]: three weeks ago for fiber.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as we said, Alta won't be ready for
another three weeks.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it continues to accumulate biomass over
that time because of its late flowering
[SPEAKER_21]: nature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the last point I want to make is that
these small plot trials have been
[SPEAKER_21]: organized by my colleague Bob Pierce at
University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we all work together under the
organization of a USDA program,
[SPEAKER_21]: which is called the Multistate Program.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that particular hemp research project
is called S1084.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can Google that S1084 hemp
research.
[SPEAKER_21]: And our project objectives and some of our
initial results will come up when you
[SPEAKER_21]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_21]: But these types of plots are replicated,
I think, this year.
[SPEAKER_21]: There are about 15 different institutions.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you went to the Lancaster Hemp Circuit,
you saw another replicate that Alyssa
[SPEAKER_21]: Collins planted at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_21]: But we have Ursa Alta and Ursa Grande in
all of those small plot trials around the
[SPEAKER_21]: country.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will get very good data from our
academic colleagues on the performance of
[SPEAKER_21]: those two varieties anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_21]: And Shelby Ellison is here from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_21]: David Gang is here from Washington.
[SPEAKER_21]: Penn State, they can tell you how Ursa
Alta and Ursa Grande are doing compared
[SPEAKER_21]: with other lines that are in this trial.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just one final note about, because Sarah
is raising her hand, one final note about
[SPEAKER_21]: obtaining seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to order your seed as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you could order it now, you should do
it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you should go talk to Robin Destich
from Kanapa, US if you want some of their
[SPEAKER_21]: outstanding varieties.
[SPEAKER_21]: You should talk to Sarah Mitchell of
King's Agriseed, who distributes
[SPEAKER_21]: international hemp and verve seed
varieties, and any others?
[SPEAKER_21]: And New West Genetics.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I forgot about them.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep, just one more point here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't want to forget my colleagues
from IND Hemp.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have an excellent variety here,
which we've labeled SS Beta.
[SPEAKER_21]: But commercially is known as IH Williams,
named after our deceased colleague David
[SPEAKER_21]: Williams from University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_21]: So here you have three excellent seed
brokers to talk to if you want to order
[SPEAKER_21]: seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Valerie, you were asking about
cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, certainly in a breeding program,
we would not grow anything any breeding
[SPEAKER_21]: lines in the presence of these varieties.
[SPEAKER_21]: We want isolation preferably of three
miles to make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_21]: cross-pollination and to maintain the
purity of our varieties.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's also critical during the production
of certified seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the rules state if you're going to
produce seed for planting, you cannot have
[SPEAKER_21]: any other hemp within three miles to make
sure that we maintain that purity.
[SPEAKER_21]: In a monaceous variety, it's most likely
self-pollinated because the male and
[SPEAKER_21]: female flowers are within the same
inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_21]: And obviously in the dioecious varieties,
you have male individuals and female
[SPEAKER_21]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just say one thing we note about
those male individuals.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're very attractive to bees,
both honeybees and bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is a good food source.
[SPEAKER_21]: Male pollen is a good food source for
bees, but hemp is entirely
[SPEAKER_21]: wind-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_21]: Those bees do not go to the female
flowers.
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the growing conditions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the crop shorter to me?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you're not the only one that noticed
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I also wanted the same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I've noticed, and this is one
idea that I have, well, not idea,
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry, hypothesis that I have,
is that this field after severe rainfall
[SPEAKER_12]: events, it gets really waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I believe that it may have suffered
from waterlogging stress, and that's why
[SPEAKER_12]: it has not reached its, you know,
very... Is there one type that suffers
[SPEAKER_11]: more than the other?
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_12]: I cannot tell you, but there is another
plant that I replicated this three weeks
[SPEAKER_12]: after, which you can see in the back over
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those look way taller.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that field does not suffer from that
waterlogging.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would imagine that waterlogging to be
the main factor why they are shorter.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the planting date?
[SPEAKER_12]: This one was May 20th.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was June 13th.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so hemp does not like to be wet,
and it will stop growing when it rains and
[SPEAKER_21]: when it's, you know, waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_21]: The remnants of what was it, Hurricane
Debbie, came through and gave us a lot of
rain.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was about four inches of rain that day.
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is another sort of feature of our
research fields here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You see that we maintain these two-acre
blocks, and these two-acre blocks have
[SPEAKER_21]: been here for decades.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as we plow these blocks and then
maintain driveways in between,
[SPEAKER_21]: the soil subsides and they become swimming
pools.
[SPEAKER_21]: So when it rains, our fields get flooded,
and you'll notice we have a two-acre field
[SPEAKER_21]: of Ursa Alta up on the hill there on the
other side of the apples.
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you look at that, it is tallest
in the middle, and the plants have even
[SPEAKER_21]: died around the edges of the swimming pool
because that's where the water pools.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm actually trying to get the folks
here to knock down our driveways and to
[SPEAKER_21]: just plow everything again and get rid of
these driveways and level out the swimming
pool.
[SPEAKER_21]: There are lots more questions you could
ask, so definitely catch up to Luis or
[SPEAKER_21]: other folks in my group wearing Agritech
shirts, but I do want to give you about 20
[SPEAKER_21]: minutes to walk through the plots and see
any features that you're curious about.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we will meet at that speaker over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing we've learned, and you can
talk to any of the researchers here who
[SPEAKER_21]: have been trying to establish hemp in
trials over the last six or seven years,
[SPEAKER_21]: that it can be very challenging to get
good stand establishment of hemp.
[SPEAKER_21]: It does not like to be wet, so what I
always tell my folks when they're very
[SPEAKER_21]: anxious to get their research trials going
is to plant after the storm.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a lot of crops, you would think,
oh, I want to get that seed in the ground,
[SPEAKER_21]: and then it's going to rain, and my seed
is going to pop right up after that rain.
[SPEAKER_21]: I do not recommend that for hemp.
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to let that rain saturate the
soil and then watch the soil moisture and
[SPEAKER_21]: then plant.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because when it's flooded, it will not
come up.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's one little thing to think about,
is proper soil moisture and depth and
[SPEAKER_21]: plant deep, plant down to where your
moisture is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_21]: But the other critical aspect is weed
management, and we are very fortunate to
[SPEAKER_21]: have Dr. Lynn Sosnowski here, who is our
weed scientist at Cornell and has been
[SPEAKER_21]: doing a lot of work on herbicide control
and non-herbicide methods for weed
[SPEAKER_21]: management, and is also our state
representative to the IR4 program.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to turn it over to her,
and she's going to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_21]: herbicides and sonilin, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks for coming out, and thanks
for having me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to talk a little bit about
some of the work that we've been doing
[SPEAKER_09]: through a USDA CPPM project, looking at
hemp competition, hemp weed control,
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as some of our IR4 project.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hemp in some outlets has been reported
as being fairly competitive with weeds,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think the work that we've done here
is that if you don't get a good stand
[SPEAKER_09]: establishment, if the weeds get a jump on
you, hemp is not necessarily going to
[SPEAKER_09]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And frankly, our work that we've been
doing across five states in both
[SPEAKER_09]: transplanted hemp and seeded hemp really
suggests that we're going to need about
[SPEAKER_09]: four to six weed-free weeks after
emergence to really maximize hemp growth
[SPEAKER_09]: and yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do want to point out that this is
going to require integrated weed
[SPEAKER_09]: management.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everybody knows that pesticide
options are limited in hemp, and that
[SPEAKER_09]: includes herbicides.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one single herbicide, and frankly,
we are lucky to have that one herbicide
[SPEAKER_09]: for use in hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am going to point out, if you do have
the handout here, I do have a link in it
[SPEAKER_09]: to a free book that you can download from
the Northeast SARE website called
[SPEAKER_09]: Integrated or Sustainable Weed Management
on Your Farm, Ecological Weed Management
[SPEAKER_09]: on Your Farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is great book.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about integrated weed management
practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since we only have one herbicide,
I do want to start off with the integrated
[SPEAKER_09]: weed management practices that we should
be engaged in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be thinking about when we're
going to plant hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: First is going to be site selection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thinking about the fields that you have
available to plant into.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have fields with really competitive
weed species, really high densities of
[SPEAKER_09]: weeds, or perennial weeds like bindweed,
Canada thistle, that would be a field to
[SPEAKER_09]: avoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So being very mindful about scouting your
fields, understanding what the weed
[SPEAKER_09]: communities look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a couple of pigweed species here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our usual Powell amaranth,
red root, smooth pigweed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have Palmer amaranth and
waterhemp creeping into the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those weeds can grow up to 10 feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need, if you're going to be
rotating into an agricultural production
[SPEAKER_09]: field, and there could be Palmer amaranth
and waterhemp, that is not a field we want
[SPEAKER_09]: to be in with hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the options for controlling
these species.
[SPEAKER_09]: They grow tall, they grow fast,
and the seed production is enormous.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those seed banks build very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another technique that we can use is a
stale seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seedbed technique.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to depend on your
planting date and the species that you
[SPEAKER_09]: have there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can allow species to germinate and
then go in and kill them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Either when they're at the white thread
stage, a shallow disking.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go in with a non-selective
herbicide that you can burn them down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go in with a flame weeder.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something we're doing with craers
right now in their organic beet
[SPEAKER_09]: production, is letting the weeds get up,
going in with a flame weeder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Burning them off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe doing that two or three times before
planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that seed bank that's already present,
allowing some of those weeds to get up and
[SPEAKER_09]: then get them killed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe when it comes time for planting,
you are dealing with fewer option,
[SPEAKER_09]: fewer weeds that are going to need to be
controlled.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seedbed preparation.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for, you know, general crop
management.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having a smooth, even bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can plan into a smooth,
even bed, you're going to facilitate good
[SPEAKER_09]: seed soil contact.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have better stand
establishment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully you're going to have more even
germination, more even emergence and
[SPEAKER_09]: growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is going to help you have a
strong crop stand because you're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: want to maximize crop vigor and stand
development.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously choosing varieties with high
vigor, rapid growth as is appropriate for
[SPEAKER_09]: what other parameters you're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically you want to make sure that
you've got a good even stand.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to minimize the space that's
available for the weeds to colonize.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when it comes to harvest time,
making sure that you're harvesting clean
[SPEAKER_09]: fields first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not go to your weediest field.
[SPEAKER_09]: Harvest that and then go to a field that's
relatively clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: All you are doing is moving weed seed from
your weedy field now to your clean field.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Hunter from New York State IPM.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a separate handout and this is
just general for all your harvest
[SPEAKER_09]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is talking about weed seed movement and
equipment clean out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please check this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are doing, you know, kind of your
grain, your fiber harvesting, whether
[SPEAKER_09]: you're talking hemp, whether you're
talking other crops, we are moving a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of weed seed around.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are moving a lot of problematic weeds
like the water hemp, like the Palmer
[SPEAKER_09]: hammerhead is coming in on our equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a, this is an easy strategy we
can use to minimize the spread of some of
[SPEAKER_09]: these super invasive, super problematic
species.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the last thing I want to talk about
is, is going to be herbicides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Herbicides can be both in the season with
that hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be talking about sauna
land.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we do talk about if we can put hemp
into an effective crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can get very good weed control in
pre-seeding crops, that can help us in our
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: But understand labels have rotation
restrictions on them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are rotation restrictions on the
labels and you must pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those rotation restrictions are there from
the EPA because of residue potential.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to tell you, hemp is very
sensitive to a lot of herbicides.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got to be very mindful.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to be thinking also of what the
carryover injury could potentially be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have looked at about a dozen plus soil
applied herbicides, and I'm going to tell
[SPEAKER_09]: you what, about 11 of them have,
have killed hemp outright.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got to be very mindful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, it's kind of a double edged
sword.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might get good weed control in one
crop, but the rotation restrictions,
[SPEAKER_09]: those potential residue concerns,
that potential injury could be an issue of
[SPEAKER_09]: rotating into the hemp here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please be mindful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hemp is not going to fall into a lot
of those crop rotation restrictions.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it falls under the other crop category,
which tends to be much more restrictive.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So onto sauna land.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sauna land is our only registered
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a supplemental label in New York
state.
[SPEAKER_09]: It expires on the 1st of May in 2026.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to go to the Nicepad
website and download that supplemental
[SPEAKER_09]: label and have it on hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: This herbicide, ethafloralin, it is a
yellow herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone who is familiar with the WSSA
groups, this is a group three.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dinitroanilin.
[SPEAKER_09]: This herbicide is primarily effective at
suppressing annual grasses, such as crab
[SPEAKER_09]: grasses, foxtails, barnyard grass.
[SPEAKER_09]: It may have activity against some small
seeded annual broadleaves like pigweeds,
[SPEAKER_09]: nightshades, but it is not a strong
broadleaf herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not think about this as a broadleaf
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about this as a grass herbicide
primarily.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be applied at rates ranging from
one and a half to three pints per acre.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we've used 2.5 in our soils
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: These rates are going to be dependent on
your soil type.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a coarse soil and you're
sandier, you'd want to go lower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this can be incorporated two ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be applied as a pre-emergent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So after the crop has been planted,
applied to the surface, and then it's
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have to be irrigated in,
or it's going to have to have rainfall to
[SPEAKER_09]: move it into the soil solution where it's
active, or it can be mechanically
[SPEAKER_09]: incorporated, pre-plant incorporated.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sauna land is applied, it's
incorporated, you plant into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if we have done a study here on the
campus, and basically we found pre-plant
[SPEAKER_09]: incorporated versus pre-emergent,
we had hemp emerge and establish equally
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_09]: With respect to the weed control,
this year the pre-plant incorporated gave
[SPEAKER_09]: us much better control than our
pre-emergent.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a very dry year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a very dry year, so we felt that we
got that sauna land incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_09]: soil solution physically better than we
would have done with the pre-emergence.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other issue we had is when that soil
started to dry down, we started to have
[SPEAKER_09]: cracks in the soil, and our weeds started
to come up through the cracks,
[SPEAKER_09]: completely avoiding the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been shown in other crops,
is that where we have dry conditions,
[SPEAKER_09]: pre-plant incorporated may be more
effective than a pre-emergence
[SPEAKER_09]: application.
[SPEAKER_09]: Understand, if you are going to be doing a
pre-plant incorporated, this is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be a single-pass mechanical incorporation,
treflon, similar herbicide to ethyl
[SPEAKER_09]: fluoroline.
[SPEAKER_09]: We like to do two passes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ethyl fluoroline is recommended as a
single pass.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have clumps and clods, if that soil
is too wet, you are not going to
[SPEAKER_09]: incorporate that herbicide well.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are going to have patchy weeds
control, and you have the potential for
[SPEAKER_09]: increased herbicide injury because you
will have it concentrated in certain areas
[SPEAKER_09]: as opposed to others.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am also going to tell you, if we get
heavy rainfall and we have flooded
[SPEAKER_09]: conditions, you will get injury from sauna
land.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is mentioned on the label.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you will see is stubby roots.
[SPEAKER_09]: You will see swollen, brittle stems,
and you can just have breakage right
[SPEAKER_09]: there, and that will be a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Particularly, if we get strong winds
coming through.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because this is registered does not
mean it is 100% safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get injury, particularly under wet
conditions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the injury potential is going to be
increased if you do not have your sprayer
[SPEAKER_09]: calibrated properly, you are not putting
it out at the proper rate, or you do not
[SPEAKER_09]: line up and you have overlapping,
and you are increasing the concentration
[SPEAKER_09]: of that herbicide in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing I would like to mention is
I am the state liaison for the IR4.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do the IR4 research for herbicides here
in New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to just point out is that we do
put hemp recommendations, hemp requests
[SPEAKER_09]: into the IR4 program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, we are setting our final
priorities for the 2025 season.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were hundreds of requests that went
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Across weed science, plant pathology,
entomology, and all crops, we have to
[SPEAKER_09]: narrow it down to 40.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hemp gets two.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I am going to tell you, I do not think
herbicides are going to be in the program
[SPEAKER_09]: for next year for hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just looking at the IR4 food requests in
previous years, we have recommended dual
[SPEAKER_09]: magnum, we have recommended vermoxanil,
we have recommended stinger.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have recommended all herbicides that we
have seen a measure of safety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the manufacturers have said
they are not going to support.
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, we recommended clethodim.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a grass herbicide, a post-emergence
grass herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: We heard back at this workshop,
the manufacturer will not support.
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, there are two other residual
herbicides that are kind of in the mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, just based on discussions with
the weed science team, it is not looking
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is just too much variable injury
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to just swing it back to what I
started off with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not very confident about the
herbicide outlook for the future,
[SPEAKER_09]: just from an injury standpoint and from a
company standpoint with respect to
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations, legality, and just their
twitchiness of being involved with hemp in
[SPEAKER_09]: its current regulation environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which means that we are going to have to
be very, very, very mindful about the
[SPEAKER_09]: integrated weed management.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, weed management in preceding crops,
again thinking about herbicide residue and
[SPEAKER_09]: injury potential from those products and
then using those alternate strategies.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am really very, very, very interested in
doing some more tests with the stale
[SPEAKER_09]: seedbed techniques going forward next
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_21]: Lynn is trying to run away before you ask
any questions.
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions for Lynn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say we are doing a priority setting
right now and I left so I could come up
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, question.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many varieties was the herbicide
trialed on?
[SPEAKER_09]: That I cannot tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is the other problem and thank you
for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_21]: The pre-plant incorporation versus pre.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have just done Biala Brzezki here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have done other pre-emergence trials
with Anka and I am going to tell you,
[SPEAKER_09]: seed bigger is really going to change that
too because we had some Anka that did not
[SPEAKER_09]: have a good seed bigger.
[SPEAKER_09]: And boy, herbicide injury is magnified if
you do not have good seed bigger.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that crop is going to struggle to get
out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me, we have seen it across crops.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I want to bring up
about hemp, even with the sauna land,
[SPEAKER_09]: the label says it is not tested on all
hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have a lot of genetic diversity in
this crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the USDA actually just published a
paper on field corn and sweet corn on a
[SPEAKER_09]: herbicide that we have labeled and that we
use regularly, an HPPP herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they found that there was a whole
genetic background across all of our corn
[SPEAKER_09]: that is in some of the sweet corn and in
some of the field corn and it makes the
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties that were evolved from that more
sensitive to this one herbicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is the other issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot test every variety out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot test all the genetic background.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to understand there is always
going to be that potential for injury.
[SPEAKER_09]: We think we know everything about corn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been working on corn forever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just this year discovered a genetic
element that makes certain varieties more
[SPEAKER_09]: sensitive to a herbicide that we have had
registered.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just understand there is a lot in that
genetic background that is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially influence the safety.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the sauna land label does recommend
testing on small amounts of a planted crop
[SPEAKER_09]: at first or become familiar with this in a
variety that you are going to use because
[SPEAKER_09]: there is just that potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question from David.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned mechanical incorporation
pre-planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How deep?
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we went two inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shallow.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a shallow
incorporation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I think probably your soil
quality is going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, making sure that it is evenly
incorporated in that two inches.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Lynn.
[SPEAKER_21]: She is a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you have questions about weed
management, please don't hesitate to
[SPEAKER_21]: contact Lynn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she always gets back to you very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is a good segue, David,
for my little three-minute discussion
[SPEAKER_21]: about site preparation.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we use conventional tillage on this
farm.
[SPEAKER_21]: We use relatively little no-till practices
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of our trials that you see here
were moldboard plowed, disked,
[SPEAKER_21]: and then culture mulched, I believe,
until we got a fairly well-fitted field.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we applied the sauna land culture
mulch to incorporate it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the latest thing that we have been
doing is incorporating a rolling step.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I learned that from my friend Corby
Middeth of Kanapa, U.S.
[SPEAKER_21]: that he said in France, they roll all of
their fields.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we, most of these fields out here
have been rolled after planting.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the small plot trial, we seeded it with
our cone seeder, and then we rolled the
[SPEAKER_21]: field.
[SPEAKER_21]: And by doing that, we ensure good
seed-to-soil contact.
[SPEAKER_21]: We get a nice level field.
[SPEAKER_21]: If we were going to do the pre-emerging,
version application of sauna land,
[SPEAKER_21]: as Lynn said, we would have a nice level
surface for that.
[SPEAKER_21]: We ensure that the seed is buried,
because bird predation right after
[SPEAKER_21]: planting is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_21]: And actually, I think, especially at the
higher seeding rate for the fiber
[SPEAKER_21]: varieties, those birds, the doves,
can pick out the rows that you've seeded
[SPEAKER_21]: at a higher seeding rate, and they will
just sit there and eat all your seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a minor thing, don't dismiss it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the final benefit that we see of
rolling is that it pushes the rocks down.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the first year we started baling,
and then running bales through our
[SPEAKER_21]: decorticator, we learned that they were
full of rocks.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you need to be, when we get to the
raking demonstration, you cannot be too
[SPEAKER_21]: aggressive with the rake, and flip rocks
up into your windrows, because they will
[SPEAKER_21]: end up in your bales, and you really don't
want rocks going through your
[SPEAKER_21]: decorticator.
[SPEAKER_21]: So by rolling, one benefit that we see is
that you push the rocks down, at least to
[SPEAKER_21]: the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did a little study.
[SPEAKER_21]: This field that Jacob just started
cutting, that's field 20, was rolled.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just make sure I get my notes right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Was rolled before planting, and then we
seeded it with a John Deere no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_21]: The farther field, the next two acres
down, which is field 25, we rolled after
[SPEAKER_21]: seeding, because I was talking with Sarah
Mitchell, and she said, oh, you can't roll
[SPEAKER_21]: after seeding.
[SPEAKER_21]: You won't get emergence.
[SPEAKER_21]: You've seen it with attractor wheels.
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually what I saw was there was no
difference in the stand count at three
[SPEAKER_21]: weeks, whether you roll before planting or
roll after seeding.
[SPEAKER_21]: And in fact, this is our roller.
[SPEAKER_21]: We just parked it out there, so you can
take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not going to compress.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not super heavy, so it's not going to
compress evenly across the field.
[SPEAKER_21]: But what I saw is the areas where it did
compress and we had a nice, smooth,
[SPEAKER_21]: flat surface, that's where the seeds came
up first, because of that seed-to-soil
[SPEAKER_21]: contact.
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of our fields around here,
we grow a lot of alfalfa around our dairy
[SPEAKER_21]: farms.
[SPEAKER_21]: Those fields are rolled before planting.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think it's probably a practice you
want to think about for your grain and
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing we're going to hear about
is seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_21]: So Patrick McMullen is a PhD student in
Chris Smart's lab in plant pathology and
[SPEAKER_21]: has done some really interesting work,
and he'll describe this trial,
[SPEAKER_21]: which is behind us.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: So like Larry said, I'm a PhD student in
plant pathology, studying soil-borne
[SPEAKER_17]: pathogens in hemp and their management
strategies.
[SPEAKER_17]: And here I conducted a small plot trial
looking at fungicide seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_17]: To control damping off in soil-borne
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we've just been hearing about,
stand establishment is a big concern for
[SPEAKER_17]: hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that we know how to perfectly
manage weeds, thanks to Lynn, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_17]: another piece of that puzzle is pathogen
management.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a number of soil-borne
pathogens that hemp is susceptible to,
[SPEAKER_17]: including a number of species of pythium
that we have found here in New York.
[SPEAKER_17]: Other areas of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_17]: have reported similar findings,
as well as different species of fusarium,
[SPEAKER_17]: among other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_17]: So most of these pathogens like cool,
wet soils, like we have here in the
[SPEAKER_17]: northeast, early in the growing season
when we're planting.
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we've heard in some earlier
presentations, soil drainage is super
[SPEAKER_17]: important, ensuring that your fields
aren't planted in low-lying spots that
[SPEAKER_17]: flood easily.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are great areas for pathogens to
just thrive and take off.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're planting into wet fields,
the pythium will love that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Same thing with fusarium.
[SPEAKER_17]: They can lead to damping off, vascular
wilts, and root and crown rots.
[SPEAKER_17]: So here I have been testing fungicide seed
treatments in a collaborative project with
[SPEAKER_17]: both Larry's lab and Alan Taylor's lab as
seed scientists here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_17]: They thankfully treated the seeds for us.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I used several different fungicide seed
treatments.
[SPEAKER_17]: There were two that were copper hydroxide
products, Americop and Oltum, as well as a
[SPEAKER_17]: phosphite product in phosphorus,
prudent 44 and neutral.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we compared these to a
conventional fungicide treatment of apron
[SPEAKER_17]: and maxim, which is gluteoxynol and
methanol.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the coppers and phosphites are in the
works of being registered for hemp,
[SPEAKER_17]: but the apron and maxim is not.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were using this as a research control
that we expected to work well,
[SPEAKER_17]: as it usually works well on the fungal
soilborne pathogens, as well as the water
[SPEAKER_17]: molds like pythium.
[SPEAKER_17]: So these seeds were treated and then
planted with a cone seeder into these
[SPEAKER_17]: small plot trials.
[SPEAKER_17]: And stand counts were collected three
weeks after post-planting, as well as six
[SPEAKER_17]: weeks, and then again at harvest.
[SPEAKER_17]: This study we completed fully last year
and then replicated again this year that
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm standing in front of.
[SPEAKER_17]: This year we added an additional
formulation of Oltum that isn't on the
[SPEAKER_17]: handout, but is on the field map if you're
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So looking at the data from last year,
we saw increases in stand counts for all
[SPEAKER_17]: of the seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking at the percent increase,
I should mention we tested this on two
[SPEAKER_17]: different fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's Fiber 79 and Futura 83 that
Luis talked a good bit about in our
[SPEAKER_17]: previous presentations.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we wanted to test these on two
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we saw numeric increases in stand
count with all of these fungicide seed
[SPEAKER_17]: treatments at three weeks post-planting,
with only significant increases of 58%
[SPEAKER_17]: increase compared to the non-treated
control in Oltum and the Prudent 44 in
[SPEAKER_17]: neutral treatments.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's quite a large increase there,
58% compared to non-treated.
[SPEAKER_17]: However, then when we went to the later
stand count time points, we did not see
[SPEAKER_17]: significant increases, although we did
still see some numeric increases.
[SPEAKER_17]: At harvest, we also collected biomass last
year and saw no significant increases,
[SPEAKER_17]: no significant differences in plant
biomass between any of the treatments
[SPEAKER_17]: compared to the controls.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this year we replicated that and we are
also including the same planting density
[SPEAKER_17]: as we did last year, 30 plants per square
foot, square feet, which is over here on
[SPEAKER_17]: your left side.
[SPEAKER_17]: And over on your right is a reduced
planting density of 15 plants per square
[SPEAKER_17]: feet.
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to see if when a seed treatment
is applied, can we use a lower planting
[SPEAKER_17]: density to therefore use less seed?
[SPEAKER_17]: Will that give us an economic gain that
we're putting less seed into the field
[SPEAKER_17]: while increasing stand establishment?
[SPEAKER_17]: So those trials are being evaluated
currently.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to be collecting harvest data
this coming week.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't have those final numbers for
you yet, but all of that data should be
[SPEAKER_17]: available next summer and hopefully give
us some insight into the best practices
[SPEAKER_17]: for managing some of our pathogens.
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say one interesting thing that I
saw in this year's data was that all of
[SPEAKER_17]: the seed treatments, except for the
conventional apron and maximum treatment,
[SPEAKER_17]: significantly increased stand count at
three weeks post planting.
[SPEAKER_17]: So these were the copper and phosphate
products, however, not the conventional
[SPEAKER_17]: fungicides of methanoxin and deoxynol.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that leads us to think maybe there's
something else at play here other than
[SPEAKER_17]: just soil borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's a nutritional thing that these
extra compounds are helping with.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not quite sure what's going on
because we would expect this conventional
[SPEAKER_17]: fungicide to be quite effective.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not a lot of known resistance to
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's effective against other soil
borne pathogens in other crops that are
[SPEAKER_17]: infected with these same species.
[SPEAKER_17]: So at this point, it looks like the future
outlook for seed treatments is quite well
[SPEAKER_17]: for improving stand count, stand
establishment.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we will be looking at some final data
here to see differences in biomass harvest
[SPEAKER_17]: as well as stem diameters and plant
height.
[SPEAKER_17]: So for now, some of the best practices you
can do to avoid soil borne pathogen
[SPEAKER_17]: management is really focusing on those
cultural practices, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Ensuring your well-drained fields,
sanitizing your equipment, and trying to
[SPEAKER_17]: get a good stand early by planting at
times, maybe not right before a storm,
[SPEAKER_17]: like Larry's pointing out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Make sure you're planting in appropriate
weather.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd be happy to take any questions you
might have about pathogen management.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I just want to confirm, Patrick,
we did not apply sonolin to this field,
[SPEAKER_21]: correct?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so these fields were rolled post
seeding, but we did not apply an
[SPEAKER_17]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, this is an anecdotal observation.
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, you can talk more with Lynn
about it.
[SPEAKER_21]: But when you compare our other fields and
drive around and see our other fields that
[SPEAKER_21]: were treated with sonolin compared to this
field, there's a lot of grass in that.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm pretty psyched about sonolin.
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems to be working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pre-plant incorporation.
[SPEAKER_21]: Questions for Patrick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which copper?
[SPEAKER_17]: The question was which copper.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is copper hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_17]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the question is,
[SPEAKER_17]: can the seed treatment make the seed less
attractive to birds?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I think that can very well be true.
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have data to support that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't test that in experimental
design.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do imagine that the birds are not
choosing these fungicide-treated seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the non-treated control was truly
non-treated.
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't have the film coat seed
treatment.
[SPEAKER_15]: We saw some stem borers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stem borers?
[SPEAKER_17]: Stem borers?
[SPEAKER_17]: I have not observed a lot of that in my
field.
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't really collected insect data.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think we do see.
[SPEAKER_21]: But we really don't have that many stem
borers.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not an economic problem in New York.
[SPEAKER_21]: Or grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're here thankful.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: So our next series of thank you,
Patrick.
[SPEAKER_21]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're now going to move on to a series of
equipment demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to assemble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So move hastily.
The
[SPEAKER_02]: material dries faster, rests more evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately, it takes less work on
your rake and baler to be able to move
[SPEAKER_02]: that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you see the rake going through,
you'll start to understand how 12-foot
[SPEAKER_02]: stalks are a little bit challenging for
that type of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like the machine is getting a
little bit closer to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably have to stop talking now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look over there, you'll
see something major happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I travel around the country in fall,
fixing equipment as necessary,
[SPEAKER_02]: working with growers, understanding more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see behind us is our current
generation of machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every year, we get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not a very complacent company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get bored quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see stuff evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to continue to evolve
pieces of equipment like this as an
[SPEAKER_02]: industry changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to make people aware that
while we do develop this machine,
[SPEAKER_02]: this isn't the end all be all of how to
harvest hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of application
for this type of machine in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other types of implements out
there that can work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've developed equipment for forage
harvesters that can windrow material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can go back and pick that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just depends on what your
application is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're going to market with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you got to think about
when you're looking at growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're looking at processing hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the end result need to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then work that backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you usually get to the right
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start the equipment first and work
it forward, you'll oftentimes run into
[SPEAKER_02]: some bottlenecks that are really hard to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Larry for letting us run
the machine today and being a part of what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do at Dish Enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm proud to be a part of what people
are doing here at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see that on this side,
I had a few more cutting issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look to the other side,
it's actually a very clean cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so crop conditions are very important
for your harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you might have noticed we were
cutting a bit this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really wet this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little more difficult than it
should have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: An 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest is definitely different from a 2 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something I've noticed with
all of the fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a lot harder to harvest
traveling to the north, where to the
[SPEAKER_03]: south, it's a much cleaner cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crop falls where it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this direction, it tends to get pushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get a little bit more lodging.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice I'm adjusting the height of
the machine up and down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you want to get as low of a cut
as possible to get as much tonnage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in some situations, you might have
planted too densely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crop might be too moist, and you have
to cut a couple inches above just to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: that crop flowing smoothly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of in-field conditions
you have to be aware of outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: machine itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: Andrew didn't mention this.
[SPEAKER_21]: Jacob didn't mention it either.
[SPEAKER_21]: But this machine broke, what, three weeks
ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it broke as I was going to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished all my cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything went well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a weld fail and some steel
fell on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a bit of a repair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have the parts to show people
later if anyone wants to see that damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the most important thing, as Andrew
said, is we do stand behind our equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was able to make a call.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to get something fabricated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to have my parts in time to
continue harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, to show it off to
you all here today.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I gave Andrew a call, and he said,
yep, we're making a new tongue for you.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll have that shipped to you in a few
days.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he said, you know, normally I question
the operator about that.
[SPEAKER_21]: But in this case, I guess I can't really
do that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, we really appreciate the support
of this enterprises.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also want to take a minute here to
thank Andrew as the leader of the
[SPEAKER_21]: Hempstead Coalition.
[SPEAKER_21]: And for all of his efforts, tireless
efforts in getting that first application
[SPEAKER_21]: through.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we're already working on the next
application for beef cattle.
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to say a few words about Hempbeat
Coalition, Andrew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of my favorite subjects
in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the largest opportunity to
the hemp industry is to open up the animal
[SPEAKER_02]: feed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to reduce the cost of
production across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're growing for herd,
fiber, grain, adenoid, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal feed is going to lower the cost of
production across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been involved with the Hempfeed
Coalition for going on almost five years
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked on the egg laying chicken
application for just over three and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we received a recommendation
from the FDA back in February.
[SPEAKER_02]: AFCO voted in favor of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a state regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Larry's point, what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can't stop with egg laying
chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although egg laying chickens,
interestingly enough, 5%, if we impact 5%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the egg laying chicken market,
that's 670,000 needed acres of hemp to be
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in the United States just for egg
laying chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not broiler chickens, not roosters,
just egg layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's next is beef cattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beef cattle and lamb are up on the docket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think we'll have an expedited result
with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a tremendous amount of research
data available for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FDA actually came to us and said that
they felt that our data was sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to push an application through
without any further studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really positive to have that
relationship now with the FDA to move
[SPEAKER_02]: these along.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully within about 24 months,
maybe 30 months, we could see beef cattle
[SPEAKER_02]: approved in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, we're looking at equine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some studies going on with
equine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Equine and also looking at the holes and
how horses benefit from the holes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, which currently we don't have a
market for at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beyond that, then broilers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing some work with broilers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as many animals as we can get studied
on, we're going to continue to push this
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to see the industry grow,
contribute to the Hemp Feed Coalition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a good group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend all of our money on studies,
on applications, and make things happen
[SPEAKER_02]: for the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Larry, for bringing up our work
at Hemp Feed Coalition.
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, the generous funding from New
York State Cornell has initiated three
[SPEAKER_21]: animal feeding studies with matching funds
from the Foundation for Food and
[SPEAKER_21]: Agricultural Research.
[SPEAKER_21]: So a total of $500,000.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we will do a study on dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_21]: We will do a study on broiler chickens.
[SPEAKER_21]: And an equine feeding study with hemp seed
meal.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we hope, again, to cooperate with IND
Hemp to provide that hemp seed meal as a
[SPEAKER_21]: member of the FFAR Hemp Research
Coalition.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it really is a team effort.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just glad we were finally able to
get our animal scientists on board from
[SPEAKER_06]: our chicken feeding system.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, so we've cut our fiber hemp now.
[SPEAKER_21]: The next step is to let it rep and dry.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can go see how wet you can walk
through the field here.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I just wanted to give an opportunity
to our guest from Poland, Maciej Kowalski.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully, my Polish is somewhat
acceptable in hemp seed meal.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's going to talk about his experience in
Poland with Redding and his company and
[SPEAKER_21]: the potential for hemp for textile.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just wondering how to pronounce my
name.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Maciej.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been asked to share my experiences
with what we're doing in Poland,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is basically a vertically integrated
company, which grows hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: We harvest it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We de-cortigate it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: We cottonize it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We mix it mechanically, blend it with
cotton, spin it into yarn, and make the
[SPEAKER_13]: end product that you can actually wear.
[SPEAKER_13]: So afterwards, or in the meantime,
you can just compare that straw,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is still the same thing that Jacob
just cut down probably two or three weeks
[SPEAKER_13]: ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is supposed to be rotted.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is somehow rotted.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I want to share about is among the 10
years that I've been growing hemp for
[SPEAKER_13]: different applications for five years,
I'm focused solely on fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I say fiber, when Europeans say
fiber, they usually mean what you're
[SPEAKER_13]: calling bast, not third, not the other
application.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the bast should separate easily from
the third.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see that happening with the green
one.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why a lot of people are saying
about the green de-cortigation,
[SPEAKER_13]: because you can actually get a clean
strand of bast without any shifts.
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem with that is that you're
actually left with 75% of water,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is the average content of water,
both in the bast and in the herd.
[SPEAKER_13]: And while it is, technically speaking,
quite easy to separate the green bast,
[SPEAKER_13]: then you need to find an application for
75% water in the herd.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you have to dry it artificially.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot dry it in the field because you
won't pick it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we started doing 10 years ago is
winter-wetting, which was done
[SPEAKER_13]: accidentally by just forgetting or
actually not being able to harvest 200
[SPEAKER_13]: acres of hemp grown, something else.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is essentially happening during
winter is what happens in the very
[SPEAKER_13]: traditional method of water-wetting,
which means allowing water to dissolve the
[SPEAKER_13]: glue that is holding it together.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're doing in the
dew-wetting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dew-wetting means you actually leave it on
the ground, rake it sometimes,
[SPEAKER_13]: depending on the weather, and allow the
moisture to aid you in separating the bast
[SPEAKER_13]: from the herd.
[SPEAKER_13]: The better you do your wetting,
the easier your decortication will be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the easier the decortication will be,
the higher the quality of the hemp fiber
[SPEAKER_13]: will be.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been traveling across the United
States for three and a half weeks now,
[SPEAKER_13]: visiting different decortication
facilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see not a lot of people having a
full picture from the field, from the sea.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's plenty of great knowledge here
about what happens in America.
[SPEAKER_13]: How to allow for the best count of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: But those people that have that knowledge
usually don't have knowledge about
[SPEAKER_13]: processing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing holds true as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: People that are great with decortication
sometimes even tell, I don't care about
[SPEAKER_13]: farming.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they should, because if they don't
do the wetting properly, they will not do
[SPEAKER_13]: the decortication properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they don't do the decortication
properly, the only thing they can do with
[SPEAKER_13]: the fiber is insulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the inner works of our process?
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in the latitude of 55 north,
which is closer to Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_13]: So upstate New York is the closest thing
that I have to European conditions,
[SPEAKER_13]: Polish conditions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see the differences that Larry
mentioned earlier about the maturity of
[SPEAKER_13]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Since we are not cutting down our plants,
we let them die with the first frost,
[SPEAKER_13]: which comes around mid-April.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Ursa Alta would be actually the
marvelous plant for us because it would
[SPEAKER_13]: die off without being mature.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is obviously true that the more mature
the plant is, the stiffer the fiber is.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not exactly about maturity
itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about the weight that it carries.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's a mature plant that went into
flowering, but has actually pretty small
[SPEAKER_13]: amount of grain, the head will be light
and it will not go into that lignification
[SPEAKER_13]: that strongly.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are growing and that's something
that I would recommend you to try,
[SPEAKER_13]: especially in the upstate New York,
to get as late blooming varieties as
[SPEAKER_13]: possible, plant them April, May or
whatever, and forget them for 11 and a
[SPEAKER_13]: half months.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do pictures for your Facebook feed
or whatever, but nothing else.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nature will take control of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually all the way the water that is
falling from the sky, whether it's snow or
[SPEAKER_13]: rain or dew, is actually entering the
stalks.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the important part is that they remain
standing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people call it standing retting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if you cut it down like that and
leave it until April, it will all mold.
[SPEAKER_13]: It will over-ret.
[SPEAKER_13]: Retting essentially goes from rotting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a form of rotting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually that's microbiological processing
here, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we see with the crop that is left
standing in the field, it gets wet and
[SPEAKER_13]: then it's dried with the wind.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's actually a sort of water retting,
but in the field.
[SPEAKER_13]: The benefits of that are you're not using
any energy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not using any water.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the effluent water that takes all
those glues, which contains plenty of
[SPEAKER_13]: nitrogen, actually stays in your field
instead of polluting our rivers or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever you do with the water from water
retting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's much easier to decorticate.
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing you have to do to
decorticate the fiber like that,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's like if I would pick up a winter
retted piece of straw, I would be left
[SPEAKER_13]: with a piece of bast in my hand and all
the hurt would be falling down.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's no longer separated to each other.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need zero energy to separate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the only thing you actually need to do
is to sieve it, sift it, just separate it
[SPEAKER_13]: mechanically.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do we harvest it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone was saying that if we allow the
nails to die off in the field,
[SPEAKER_13]: then they get dry and they get entangled
in a combine harvester.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all true.
[SPEAKER_13]: With dry material, it's much more
difficult to cut it with anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't cut it at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just rake it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our most advanced piece of equipment is
standing right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a regular rake.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like really the simplest rake possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just enter it into the standing field
and it just creates a wind room without
[SPEAKER_13]: actually cutting the plants down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two things are happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Either the plants are being pulled off,
including the piece of root that plenty of
[SPEAKER_13]: people say about the huge root system that
hemp has.
[SPEAKER_13]: True, but actually the one that you're
pulling out is like an inch long.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has some hurt.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has some bast fiber which is of poor
quality, but you still get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing that might be happening is
it breaks at the bottom because with all
[SPEAKER_13]: the snow that, at least in our part of the
country, we are having snow in the winter
[SPEAKER_13]: usually.
[SPEAKER_13]: With all the snow, at the very bottom,
the plants become too brittle.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot actually harvest it when it's
freezing because if it's freezing,
[SPEAKER_13]: the plants become brittle and you're
actually destroying it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The smaller, the simpler, the slower the
rake is, the better for the fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just making a windrow and then just
bailing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The very important remark is it all
depends on your processor.
[SPEAKER_13]: During the Penn State event that Lara
mentioned, David Suchov gave a very
[SPEAKER_13]: important remark that what the farmer
wants is what your processor wants.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually you're doing it for the
buyer that is actually taking the fiber
[SPEAKER_13]: from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if it's easier for them, it depends
on what sort of line do they have,
[SPEAKER_13]: what sort of bale opener do they have,
and what's the end application of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the stuff that is being removed by the
rain water, by snow, and also by water
[SPEAKER_13]: swelling, when water freezes, it increases
its volume.
[SPEAKER_13]: When the water is inside the strand of
best fiber, that's basically fiber,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But a lot of people say about long fiber,
that technique is not applicable for long
[SPEAKER_13]: fiber at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only for short fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: But actually, I'm the minority in the hemp
industry claiming that there is no such
[SPEAKER_13]: thing as long fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is only a bundle of fibers that
might belong because the individual
[SPEAKER_13]: fibers, if you just separate it and then
you see those small, white, tiny things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone can grab a piece and look at it
later.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those small, white pieces of
something, those are actually hemp fibers.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're an inch long, inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what you're witnessing with
cotton.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are using a cotton system,
despite being a country where there is no
[SPEAKER_13]: cotton at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the United States has a huge industry
that used to process more cotton than they
[SPEAKER_13]: do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know the volumes, but basically
you have plenty of equipment that might be
[SPEAKER_13]: used for cotton.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is used for cotton in some places.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been actually in some refabricated
cotton jeans that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our colleagues, when I mentioned
the winter retting process to him a year
[SPEAKER_13]: ago, now he actually did all the acres
this way and he says he's actually having
[SPEAKER_13]: a lower electricity bill because he
doesn't really need to break all that
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: The line can be shorter because even after
the most expensive decortication equipment
[SPEAKER_13]: ever, if you don't do your retting
properly, you will end up with fiber
[SPEAKER_13]: contaminated with lots of herds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which might be good for some applications,
but it's definitely not good for textile
[SPEAKER_13]: application.
[SPEAKER_13]: For textile application, if you use the
short fiber setup, which is basically
[SPEAKER_13]: opening the fibers mechanically,
garneting them, hardening them,
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever you call it, you separate it into
individual fibers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And where does the degumming process comes
in into all that?
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people are saying about
degumming.
[SPEAKER_13]: Degumming is basically covering your
mistakes at retting.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people I hear now are interested
in green decorticated fiber, which has
[SPEAKER_13]: zero retting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in that case, in order to use it to
anything, you need to undergo a degumming
[SPEAKER_13]: process, which is basically making the
same thing that winter does for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm calling it semi-degummed because it
still doesn't remove all the lignins.
[SPEAKER_13]: It still doesn't remove everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: But winter retten hemp is actually much
better for textile.
[SPEAKER_13]: From my perspective, using my equipment
than anything that's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be done all over across the United
States, even where people don't know they
[SPEAKER_13]: did winter retting, they did winter
retting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've collected some samples this April
from North Dakota, which is probably
[SPEAKER_13]: closer in latitude to here, but also from
California.
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually spun those fibers despite
people saying, don't take that,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's just our mistake.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just forgot to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen winter retted hemp in
California, which is absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look very well.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you compare what you were seeing in the
field and you compare to this,
[SPEAKER_13]: it also doesn't look very well.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not what you're selling on
advertisement of hemp, that doesn't really
[SPEAKER_13]: look like hemp, but you also don't want to
see how most of the things are being done
[SPEAKER_13]: in between.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the winter retting process is something
that you definitely can try in here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how I'm looking at time-wise,
but probably judging by the larvae
[SPEAKER_13]: approaching me, it's probably closer to
the end.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have any questions, feel free to
ask them now, or I will be staying here
[SPEAKER_13]: until the end of the day today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you use just a standard rake and just
drive it slower, or did you have
[SPEAKER_07]: specialized equipment for your harvest in,
say, January or March or whenever you did
[SPEAKER_13]: it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to use any specialized
equipment because if you want to scale it
[SPEAKER_13]: up and you want to convince farmers,
you want them to use whatever they have.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a very regular rake.
[SPEAKER_13]: One important thing is the variety,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot choose any.
[SPEAKER_13]: But with the rake, literally, you can
choose any.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, one of my farmers, because we
grow 100 acres ourselves and we also have
[SPEAKER_13]: some farmers growing it for us,
used a larger rake, and it was actually
[SPEAKER_13]: worse because with a larger rake,
the force with which it was hitting the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant was bigger, and it actually broke
too many stems while it was happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of shifts, a lot of hurt was left
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously, I cannot achieve the speed
at which the bush brothers are doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's impossible for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm cutting two to three acres an hour
tops.
[SPEAKER_13]: When it comes to length, if that's what
you wanted to ask, the higher,
[SPEAKER_13]: the better.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know some processors don't want long
stems in their processing because they are
[SPEAKER_13]: stiff.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to bale, even bale,
something like that, if you're just going
[SPEAKER_13]: to stand, I don't know the English word
for it, but this way, and it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_13]: get up in the baler.
[SPEAKER_13]: In our case, it's already brittle,
already soft, so it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm using the bales with the whole length,
which is like 15, 16 feet tall,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then it's being separated at the
carding opening stage, which is basically
[SPEAKER_13]: drums with pin rollers and whatever you
have at the cotton gin can easily,
[SPEAKER_13]: with slight modification, open even the
longest strands of fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is essentially close to black when we
take it from the field, which does
[SPEAKER_13]: indicate some microbial infection,
you might call it, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: But actually, for textile production,
which is our sole focus, first,
[SPEAKER_13]: when you open it up, everything goes into
the dustbin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the most problematic part of that is
the health and safety of the employees
[SPEAKER_13]: actually doing that, because all that dust
contains some fungi that you don't want to
[SPEAKER_13]: introduce into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then all the mechanical processes,
there are some fibers that are
[SPEAKER_13]: over-retted.
[SPEAKER_13]: When they are totally black, that usually
means the strength is lower.
[SPEAKER_13]: The strength of the winter-retted hemp
will be lower.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you don't actually go for Kevlar
applications, you go for cotton
[SPEAKER_13]: applications.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cotton is not a very strong fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the weakened spots will actually be
destroyed in the process, in the
[SPEAKER_13]: mechanical processing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the microbiological issues will
be solved when the yarn is finished,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you weave it into fabric.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fabric is always being water-treated.
[SPEAKER_13]: This was sunflower, which is like going
through the boiling water.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't really see it as an issue,
except for the health and safety of the
[SPEAKER_13]: employee, which has to be accounted for.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: One, does winter-retting not eliminate the
lignin?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then my other question is,
what do you do with the residual waste to
[SPEAKER_14]: actually take out the fibers?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, does it take all the lignin?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it doesn't take all the lignin.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can still run it through chemical
degumming and still see some
[SPEAKER_13]: delignification.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not an academic.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just get my fiber through the spinning
mill.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the comfort of actually being able
to run even several kilos through the
[SPEAKER_13]: whole process and see if the end result is
good for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really care if there's lignin
still left in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's soft enough for me to wear and I'm
happy with it, then I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: When it comes to waste, there is not
really any waste.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, during the standing retting,
obviously all of the fibers, all of the
[SPEAKER_13]: flowers, all of the grains falling down to
the ground, all feeding the birds,
[SPEAKER_13]: which actually made me thinking when
during the morning presentation,
[SPEAKER_13]: someone said that THC testing is happening
a month before harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm harvesting in April.
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it mean I'm THC testing in March and
I can actually grow high THC varieties in
[SPEAKER_13]: New York?
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's also a solution for hot
varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it comes to the processing stage,
you get the good fiber, which goes to
[SPEAKER_13]: spinning.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got the herd, which basically goes
to any application.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than animal bedding, because of the
microbiological issues, it has a funny
[SPEAKER_13]: smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: It smells like being in a village.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know the English word for it,
but it's basically you don't... One of the
[SPEAKER_13]: decorticators, I asked him about it and he
said they did some trials and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_13]: actually affect horses.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not the horses that are buying
the herd, it's the herd's owners and they
[SPEAKER_13]: don't want the smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's used mostly for construction.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for garden mulching.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other, the third part of the
product stream is the dust.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just use it for composting because
we're not a huge processor.
[SPEAKER_13]: We rather aim to do all the processing up
until the very end stage rather than just
[SPEAKER_13]: go big and do one thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have trouble with weed control?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like when you go to bail, is there a lot
of excess grass?
[SPEAKER_13]: There is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Although it's not really associated with
winter, I think it's rather with the fact
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're using EU certified ecological
regime, which means we don't do anything
[SPEAKER_13]: with any other than mechanical destruction
because we are sowing early May so we can
[SPEAKER_13]: allow the plants, the weeds to germinate,
kill them off, allow them to germinate,
[SPEAKER_13]: kill them off.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's still plenty left.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them die off before, well,
all of them die off before processing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the processing we're using is so
mechanically aggressive that it actually
[SPEAKER_13]: reduces all of it to dust.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have zero problems with weeds in the end
product.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two things that are important to mention
is like it takes some of my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it takes some of my processing space.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I introduce a ton into the corticator
or the processing line and a hundred kgs
[SPEAKER_13]: of that is weed, well, then I'm running
essentially at 90% of the capacity,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is a nuisance, but not really a
problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one thing that I think Steve mentioned
to me is like where you just have,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're just lucky with your weeds because
some of the weeds that are growing in here
[SPEAKER_13]: are actually going through all the
processing lines.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it all depends on what sort of weeds
are they.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know the Polish name for my weeds
so I wouldn't even try to translate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we all have a goal of now coming
to visit Poland.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to give you a couple of,
again, anecdotal notes here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this field to my left is Carmignecta.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an international hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_21]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_21]: This was planted May 31st.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you see that the grain heads are,
if they're not mature, they're pretty
[SPEAKER_21]: close to mature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very similar variety offered by Verve
seeds is Jurassic.
[SPEAKER_21]: Performs very similar.
[SPEAKER_21]: SS Beta, IH Williams will also perform
like this.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like all three of those.
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year we had a grower nearby harvest
with a shell-borne stripper header on him.
[SPEAKER_21]: His conventional John Deere combine.
[SPEAKER_21]: And most of that crop went through the
stripper header quite well.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we were left with a field of standing
stems with nothing at the top.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can just imagine what Magic just
described to us.
[SPEAKER_21]: You could leave those stems to winter rep.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you've harvested the grain and then you
have a field of standing stems with no
[SPEAKER_21]: foliage and no grain head at the top that
should winter rep very well.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to point to Steve and my
other folks who are creative engineers.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think what we need is a straw walker
combine with a shell-borne stripper header
[SPEAKER_21]: that's on an elevator that you can drive
through that field and run the stripper
[SPEAKER_21]: header at eight or nine or 10 feet tall,
capture the grain.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then let's see what quality of straw
we get the next spring after we winter rep
[SPEAKER_21]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my little anecdotal suggestion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: So normally we would have cut this field.
[SPEAKER_21]: It would have been laying there drying and
starting to rep.
[SPEAKER_21]: But because our fiber cut was broken,
we didn't get a chance.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we only cut it this morning.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we, but we wanted to demonstrate to
you raking, which would be the next step.
[SPEAKER_21]: So as this dries and starts to rep,
it will rep differentially.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it will dry and turn brown on the upper
surface and then still be green on the
[SPEAKER_21]: bottom surface.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we need to turn it at least once.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also need to get it into wind rows.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are prepared to bail it.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have a hay rake to do that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Normal hay rake.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all just simple farming,
right?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what any hay farmer would do.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not complicated.
[SPEAKER_21]: The twist that we're adding today is as we
grow this crop, we want to be as
[SPEAKER_21]: sustainable as possible.
[SPEAKER_21]: And here at Corner Agritech, we want to be
the farm of the future.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we think the farm of the future will
be at least somewhat electrified.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have one of the first examples of an
electric tractor that's on the market that
[SPEAKER_21]: we purchased.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have Rich Wildman from Ag2Go,
who is now our regional distributor.
[SPEAKER_21]: Regional distributor for Monarch Tractor.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to call up Cody Light from
Monarch Tractor to describe their
[SPEAKER_21]: technology.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to see it run.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just start, but then turn this over
to Cody.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're based in Rochester.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a 100% EV, no diesel, no fuel,
rechargeable tractor.
[SPEAKER_20]: It also has the ability to operate
autonomously.
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll show you that later on.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cody, why don't you tell them just very
briefly the background of Monarch.
[SPEAKER_16]: So my name's Cody Light.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the regional sales manager for Monarch
here in the Northeast, representing with
[SPEAKER_16]: Ag2Go.
[SPEAKER_16]: But this tractor is really started in
2017.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the co-founders, there's five
co-founders of Monarch that had the same
[SPEAKER_16]: vision that Larry just stated.
[SPEAKER_16]: The sustainability, cleaning, being more
environmental friendly, but then taking it
[SPEAKER_16]: to another level of every farm has labor
shortages.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the future of Monarch is also in the
autonomy piece, which I believe that you
[SPEAKER_16]: guys will see an example of that during
lunch.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the core belief of the tractor is to
be fully electric and to give you that
[SPEAKER_16]: labor enhancing down the road.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have Chris drive it today.
[SPEAKER_16]: But while he's driving it, the
sustainability piece kind of goes into how
[SPEAKER_16]: the tractor is designed to.
[SPEAKER_16]: The original intent was to take a utility
vehicle and a tractor that came from a
[SPEAKER_16]: vineyard and kind of combined it into one.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you look at the tractor,
the front of it looks kind of goofy,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_16]: The front of it is, I like to call it the
front.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we give you a bed that can hold up to
220 pounds, and we give you D-rings in
[SPEAKER_16]: there to be able to strap things down and
use it as a bed, like you would a pickup
[SPEAKER_16]: truck or utility vehicle.
[SPEAKER_16]: The color of it, though, at the top,
that kind of sandstone is supposed to
[SPEAKER_16]: represent sand, dirt.
[SPEAKER_16]: The blue part is the battery.
[SPEAKER_16]: That battery is 110 kilowatts,
440 volts.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that color is supposed to represent
water.
[SPEAKER_16]: The dark gray is supposed to represent
rock.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we take the sustainability piece all
the way down to the color of that tractor.
[SPEAKER_16]: Through a mobile app on our phone,
I'll be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can see the video cameras live from
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can see how fast the operator's moving.
[SPEAKER_16]: If they hit something and no one tells you
about it, well, I got proof now of what
[SPEAKER_16]: really happened, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of opportunities within
this tractor.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any questions?
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he asked about weight compared to a
comparable diesel tractor, warranty,
[SPEAKER_11]: and runtime.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll throw off a warranty picture.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the tractor weighs about 5,700 pounds.
[SPEAKER_16]: So comparable to a similar horsepower
tractor, we rate this tractor 70 motor
horsepower.
[SPEAKER_16]: 40 on the PTO.
[SPEAKER_16]: It is heavy.
[SPEAKER_16]: But when we look at that battery,
so that blue part up front, if we were to
[SPEAKER_16]: weigh that compared to a diesel engine
with all of its emissions and cooling,
[SPEAKER_16]: we weigh about the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our tractors weighed at 50-50,
a typical tractor 60-40.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we put that weight across the tractor
more evenly than some of the others in the
[SPEAKER_16]: industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Runtime is up to 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's on a single chart.
[SPEAKER_16]: We offer three different chargers.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can charge that as quick as five hours
up to 10 hours overnight to be fully
[SPEAKER_16]: charged ready for the next day.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the warranty piece, the tractor
itself is a four-year, 4,000-hour
[SPEAKER_16]: warranty.
[SPEAKER_16]: The battery is an eight-year, 8,000-hour
warranty.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you look at longevity,
warranty, what the company's going to stay
[SPEAKER_16]: behind, nothing in the industry today,
gas, diesel, electric, touches this
[SPEAKER_16]: warranty.
[SPEAKER_16]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_16]: It definitely affects it.
[SPEAKER_16]: PTO takes a lot of horsepower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our last demonstration is of that
McHale baler, which you see up on the
[SPEAKER_21]: hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as you can tell, not everything goes
to plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a very small partial bail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look over here, you can see I
just really jammed that right side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a jam I've not had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to take some time to
clear that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see it only takes half a
second before you run into a problem that
[SPEAKER_03]: might take you an afternoon to fix.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a lot of vigilance when you're
running this equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only takes six inches for two seconds
too long, and you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like everything we're doing out here,
this is research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to continue to develop our
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an equipment operator, I'll continue to
learn and encounter this less and less.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can assure you, I will encounter
this more times in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're all here to do today,
is learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you can see some of the things I
deal with, which could be immediate
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have many skills, but I got
persistence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's
[SPEAKER_04]: how you make a bail.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
