[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you really know what is
pulses?
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like I'm talking to South
Carolina because they don't know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about pulses until I came to Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing, last year, 2016,
it's a lucky year for me because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the year of pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get a lot of money because
that's the year of pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with a little
background of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just from this tiny, tiny island
called Sri Lanka, which is below India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are rice farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our major staple diet is rice and lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know growing up as a child that
I'm going to work on lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate lentils when I'm growing up because
we have to eat in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch, and dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize why my parents were so
obsessed with lentils until I become a
[SPEAKER_00]: lentil physiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my graduate school, I went to
University of Saskatchewan, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my master's, PhD, and then I worked
as a lentil scientist in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest breeding programs in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the difference between the poor
farmers and the huge rich farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything done by hand, and here is
everything mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, in 2010, I went to North
Dakota State as assistant professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed there for three years,
established the National Pulse Program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I established a brand new lab
called Pulse Quality Lab for the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used by the USDA as well as the
university people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now I'm in Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little bit comparison between Sri
Lanka and Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to show you like every day we
need to eat 20 to 30 grams of lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dry lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cook it, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Saskatchewan, even though they are the
world number one lentil producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't eat lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't eat that much like Sri Lankans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we produce in US and Canada,
this all goes into the third world
[SPEAKER_00]: countries or the developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what fascinated about pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this as poor man's meat because
it's rich in protein and the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm in Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just submitted my tenure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to hear our director said
it should be in mid-April.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run the specialty crop quality program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how my fall look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my fall, I work on kale and collards
because everybody knows how this famous
[SPEAKER_00]: for kale and collards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are my undergraduate team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the winter, this is how we
grow lentils because we can't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because lentil needs 14 hour day lent as
well as the very cold Mediterranean type
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really can't do field work in South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my field experiments happen in
Morocco, India, Nepal, or Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_00]: because I work with the international
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a very clean lab,
the nutrition lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do all sort of phenotyping from
carbohydrates to protein to vitamins to
[SPEAKER_00]: polyphenols to minerals, anything,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we work with the breeders,
they want to do this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything can be quantified in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I do animal studies because
breeders, they select whatever the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: they want with the nutrition quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure the trait is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we test with the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we test with the human as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my job has 20% extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I enjoy most.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina is one of the state with
the highest obesity rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do this home garden program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the schools with my undergraduate
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start a garden club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these students build these gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether I took Michael to
show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so short.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually grow these vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my top undergraduate
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how this makes them very
happy because they don't know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to the elementary schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grow vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we talk about how they're going
to cook it and how we can mix with lentils
[SPEAKER_00]: and beans and chickpeas, how we make
hummus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we're famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how Clemson, this is how the vegan
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we are famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I want to start with my research
program, why we're doing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key factors from FAO, increasing human
population is about more than 90 million
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the global food demand is expected to
be doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we need?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to develop sustainable food
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the graduate classes that I teach
sustainable food system linking to human
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also teach an undergraduate
class called sustainable food system,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have limited arable land,
decreasing soil fertility, climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our food system has a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make enough amount of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we fix that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I work with the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because breeders are very, very important
to make enough food for our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you happy, right Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: So hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something common with me and Mike working
on hidden hunger or the micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately more than 2 billion people
are affected by the hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly iron, zinc, vitamin A,
which is the corn breeders working on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and selenium, iodine, and folate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my program, I work on mostly iron,
zinc, and selenium, folate, and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't set it up all my lab yet to do
all the B profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brand new paper came,
but it is 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked the recent data with the global
hunger index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indexes were not changed much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hidden hunger index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 52-52.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my class, the students,
they have to go through the old data and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually calculate this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they get idea how these numbers come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers come from iron, zinc,
and vitamin A deficiencies normalized into
[SPEAKER_00]: the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here, India is 48.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is 52-52.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niger is the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niger has, I think, 51.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not changed for last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all these orange areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we need to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dots are mostly iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iodine is a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about the obesity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obesity prevalence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something also I'm working on
malnutrition and then the obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina, I said about 31% of the
population is obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we call it as a globosity because it's
combined with overweight and the obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the male population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the varistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, I was talking to you about
Africa and India.
[SPEAKER_00]: India is okay, but look at the Middle East
here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are getting obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they get a little bit more income.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they like to have a little bit of
junk food because it's cool to have
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know because I grew up in Sri Lanka.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to Sri Lanka, they like to have
a Burger King.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like going out for a sitting down
meal, but they don't know what it does to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are empty calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the new papers came last
year when I was teaching my graduate study
[SPEAKER_00]: and graduate class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them to analyze the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data was based on body mass index,
which is not exactly the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are having a trend now from
micronutrient malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving to obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't we have to do something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense to you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you eat in private, you wear in
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I work with the South Carolina public
schools, elementary schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to educate our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you eat and how do you make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have a big sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to give them the education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing with the pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea about pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my mentors, Dr. Jerry Combs,
I know him since I graduated from my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's a selenium expert from
Cornell and I wanted to work on selenium,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I have been talking to him for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he has been mentoring me for all these
years, my projects, and he collaborated
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and I really, really like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dr. Welch and this paper,
1997, even though it's old, that
[SPEAKER_00]: publication has not much change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been using this every year,
even though it's old, but the idea or the
[SPEAKER_00]: concept has never changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're thinking, we need to
produce just not food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to produce the nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want empty calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want good calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we incorporate some of the nutrition
trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have corn, of course, that we can
incorporate some good nutrition traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we do that with pulses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulses are already nutritious,
but can we increase the nutrition quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the aspects like breeding
crops, that's the biofortification
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many people here are working with
the Harvest Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Rwanda program to increase iron,
zinc, and bean program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that we are
working on, but my idea, like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: pulses, but we need to have a diversified
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking you to only eat pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we eat this much of 300 different
vegetables?
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach a course called Vegetable Crops,
and there's 300 different diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables actually in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't teach them all, but think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much different vegetables you can get
with a diversified diet with the poor
[SPEAKER_00]: man's meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulses are red lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are green peas, chickpeas,
beans, and all different kinds of beans
[SPEAKER_00]: and mung beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my program basically work on lentils,
chickpeas, and little bit of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to understand everything about
lentils, and then I can use that knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: into other crops, because for me it's
difficult to study all because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: limited resources at Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal is to understand everything
about lentils and work with Mike and get
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my program has three different aspects
that I do because I have 50 research,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 teaching, and 20 extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research component, I have a huge
international research component.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with ICADA.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICADA is International Center for Dry Land
Agriculture in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where my lentil breeder is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I, I am his quality lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all sort of stuff coming into my
lab, and it's getting so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wrote a grant, and we got money to
establish a lab in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly like mine, but somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got money to establish ICP and maybe
one HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give them all the protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I train them, and it's kind of like a
synergy buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just before releasing the varieties,
I'll make sure all the traits are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is my NSF grant that I want
to work with Mike about the selenium and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the lentil productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most lentil farmers in Middle East
or Turkey or Bangladesh, these are like a
[SPEAKER_00]: small holder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing yield by 1% or maximum 5%,
that's a big deal for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big money coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wanted to go to the next step to
identify selenogenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identify different types of
carbohydrates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we feed the rats, and we see how
these guys are going to be changed their
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most interesting one I like to do,
this is I do it in South Carolina school
[SPEAKER_00]: district.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the farm to table approach,
I go to schools on Mondays and Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the kids, and I introduce them
the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they grow them in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clemson sponsor, like my project,
sponsor their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each school has a very nice school
garden, and they grow their vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't cook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a parent night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice basket full of vegetables
coming from their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take home with the recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a learning process for
them to eat healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving to past crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lentil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is chickpeas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the major crops that I work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabaceae, it's a legume crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's a cool season crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has different colors, shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I copy this from Pulse Canada,
one of my lab supporters from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, soybean come under legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pulses are mostly for the beans,
peas, and chickpeas, and lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a grower association,
Northern Pulse Grower Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: and American Pulse Association,
and USA Dry Pea Lentil Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all support my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our major states are North Dakota,
South Dakota, Montana, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I went to North Dakota to
establish the pulse lab, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the most pulses are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a story about Hum Healthy Plus,
because most people think that we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: hummers only from chickpeas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are my students.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dentist student.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a medicine student.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in first year pre-med program
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had this innovation challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to come up with a new idea to
replace regular hummers with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won, actually, $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed more than 12 different
recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was, actually, we replaced
the chickpeas with lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we replaced the tahini with flax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mixed with the corn to balance
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went to Hawaii for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are medical students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my graduate student, he went back to
the country now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a faculty in the University of
Peridonia in Sri Lanka.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have this little company,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold that into, I don't know whether
they sold that to Sabra yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actually developing all these
different hummers varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was that actually having 100
grams can provide this much of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We analyzed all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are coming from my lab numbers.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in North Dakota, it's very
difficult to grow chickpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a time that Ascocaida just wiped it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then chickpea become more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And replacing that with lentil,
per capita, price was very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's $1.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, when you add chickpea around $3,
so they replaced tahini.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tahini is the other expensive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They replaced that with flax.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't really taste different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mix with the corn to get that
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's why it increased the,
I don't have the carotenoid, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the carotenoid content because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys have a little company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I should show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all this food stuff that we made,
these are ravioli filled with lentil
[SPEAKER_00]: filling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it balanced the protein, wheat,
and the lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it balanced the protein profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hummus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also hummus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is their project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to now specify moving into my
projects that I was working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my graduate student in North
Dakota, high selenium soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selenium is an essential micronutrient,
which was identified in 1957.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the Cornell professors,
Dr. Jerry Combs, has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the world-known selenium expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I want to work on selenium,
that's how I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been mentoring me since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: My post-doctoral experience as the
Stanford University, what we did was my
[SPEAKER_00]: professors, they thought that equal amount
of arsenic and equal amount of selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: would make a former molecular structure
which cancel out the toxicity of arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this molecule will excrete it out
through the bile to the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why they did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is the arsenic causes in
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their water is poisoned with
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually some places has one PPM of
arsenic, which is very, very toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they wanted to do was they wanted
to have a human trial with selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: placebos and selenomethionine tablets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with those countries has
religion and cultures with the pills,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a little difficult to go
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that they want me to
study was can we give them lentils because
[SPEAKER_00]: their main diet is rice and lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we enrich the lentils with
selenium?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the germplasm from Ikara,
which is around 1,000 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing them hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the growth differences in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some has, when we add the selenium,
has this kind of huge growth differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I want to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about selenium
biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened in the soil, there is
selenate or selenite, which can go
[SPEAKER_00]: directly up to the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be translated into the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis cycle and the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can make selenomethionine and
selenocysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how selenium pathway happen in a
regular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some other plants called
hyperaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow on high selenium soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can extract selenium like up to
200 parts per million in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, milkweed, astrolagus,
those are the types of legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this certain pathway that they
can take up loads and loads of selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually they make all methionine
and cysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they excrete it out as a methyl
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Midwest, there's patches of these
milkwetches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these horses go eat this
milkwetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they die from the selenium
poisoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in Saskatchewan,
I walked down the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell this plant because it excrete
this dimethyl selenium compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they have a different pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we grow lentils, we thought,
well, lentil is not a hyperaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not hyperaccumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can take up loads and loads of
selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has quite a similar pathway to
hyperaccumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it produces methyl compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I walk into the greenhouse,
I can smell selenium, which is not good
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can't grow control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants can take up selenium
from the leaves, the control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we realized when we add the
selenium, it can go up to 50 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the growth sees the plant die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then definitely there's two different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I did, I used X-ray
absorption spectroscopy to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: really happening in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the lentil seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these 50 parts per million actually
load in this embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, lentil, when people eat that,
they remove the seed coat and they split
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they split it, the embryo actually
fall down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that goes to the animal feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things, we need to be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all these micronutrients,
they go low down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way of your processing,
you might lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are selenates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selenate is the inorganic compound of
selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of rhizobium growing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a special species of
rhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love this selenate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant increased the nitrogen
fixation, having these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, it influenced the taking up
more selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more similar to the nitrogen
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the juvenile leaf,
you will have more organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mature, you have more inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the root's inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the seed has lots of organic
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have HPLC set up with the mass
pack and the ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know all the selenium compounds
in about maybe 250 lentil germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not only selenomethionine and
selenocysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different methyl selenium forms
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I'm interested on methyl selenium
forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one going to cure the cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by breeding, actually, we can increase
the concentrations of all these selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these organic compounds are almost all
bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry about like iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a kind of lentil has a little bit
different pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't figured out all the enzymes
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I looked at the lentils grown in
different countries, here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference of the concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here is the North Dakota,
here is the Canada, and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had lentil trials in all these different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only that, then what I did,
I correlate the seed selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations into the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a really negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a high selenium, we found the
high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And low selenium, we found the low yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why my question I'm asking,
will selenium increase lentil yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure it increased the nutrition
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does with the yield,
we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we think there is no selenium,
selenium genes exist in the plant genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because selenium is not essential to
complete the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an essential element.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people in North Carolina, they work on
the American cranberry genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found genes related to selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new thing that I'm going to
work on next four years with Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there genes that I don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to show the proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this is the granule
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, you can see how control,
low, moderate, and high selenium,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we test this in the field as the
greenhouse with lots of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we publish the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the NDFA data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it changed the microbial
colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the roots, so there is a reason to
increase the nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, these are the common
varieties grown in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see adding selenium, it always
increased the nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's depend on the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the antioxidant protection of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the plant protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the biomass increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all depend on the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we wanted to look at the genetic
responses, or gene responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the next step of the selenium
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished screening the Lempel wild
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it was around 200,
191, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the response to the added
low selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collection was grown in Lebanon with
very, very low selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the diversity we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I brought them here to US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to screen them in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the USDA collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA collection is around 200 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start screening them at the germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know this growth response
happened, actually, during the
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, the selenate and the
control, these are the seed selenium
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the slide for the biomass
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see quite a difference with
the germ presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want, working with Steve
Krasevich and Dr. Goh, this is our next
[SPEAKER_00]: cool Lempel project, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that's what the selenium story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I wanted to talk about how the
microbiome helps on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been working on prebiotic
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been hearing about a lot of
probiotics and prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 35% of the US population is obese
because of their weird diet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: High calorie diet, low protein,
and low micronutrient diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans eat less than one third of a cup
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to eat more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do that, we need more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my lab, we measure low digestible
carbohydrate, also known as prebiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate, which divided into two
sections, dietary fiber and sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dietary fiber, this is where
people talk about dietary fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dietary fiber include the starches
and the non-starches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly resistant starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the RF4s, there's the family,
and then the fructans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is like, we are getting
increasing number of prebiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate, but I just put the basic
ones that we are interested on at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the knowledge gap here, we have
published all the data on lentil plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic responses, G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a master's student who is a medical
student right now, and he did all that
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step is we wanted to
understand the epigenetic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the seed filling, temperature,
moisture, and effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this image that I took when the
plant actually start the really little
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it start filling the pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to know whether is there a
what type of dietary fiber, or is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant starch happened during the
process of epigenetics because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: change of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we monitored this throughout the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, look, the mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we found the most resistant
starch, or like the other dietary fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: component, they start forming at the
middle of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't finished all the analysis
yet because we couldn't correlate the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to figure it out with this
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we know this prebiotic
carbohydrate change with cooking and
[SPEAKER_00]: de-hulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the last component, I'm working
with the animals, looking at the human gut
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is KSC's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Clemson has a really,
really good undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she worked with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she published a paper, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a junior.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we look at the picture, these are the
main varieties we grow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that eating at least,
which provide like 100 grams, provide 10
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of prebiotic carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Americans don't eat that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can even eat a half a cup of
lentils, it will provide five grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened in the processing cooking
and cooling on starch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about resistant starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistant starch is the starch that we
cannot digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have enzymes for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bacteria in the human gut can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the raw and cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cook it and put it into the
fridge, look at the difference of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you eat it the next day by
reheating it, you can see the starch
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a Harvard group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They publish a paper on potatoes,
because potato is the killer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But potato has a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their paper, they said that if you make
your mashed potatoes and you put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge and you eat it the next day,
actually it formed quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant starch, which is good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing that we found that you cook
it, cool it, but you put it in the fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and reheat it is much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what I'm saying is if you're
busy cooking the sundae and eat it on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still healthy, as long as you don't
grow bad bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of my students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our animal study, which is
very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control diet, we try to manipulate that
similar to regular American diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the resistant starch,
high amylose, corn diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have lentil diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we replace the control diet with 75% of
lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we replace the regular diet with 3.5%
of corn resistant starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So within six weeks, we see significant
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But six weeks is not that great,
not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all the constraints and keeping
them in the cages, they became very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the six weeks time, the food
intake is same, energy intake is same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the weight difference are quite
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we image the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liver has different stains.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the time, actually liver getting
better with the lentil feed animals
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we measure triglyceride, which is
significantly low in lentil diet animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually it does something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measure the feces and then
looking at the bacterial composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't finished the data yet,
but we were expecting something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having lentils maybe increase the
bifidobacteria and reduce the pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: By looking at data, what we realized was
six weeks is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our growers are willing to fund us to
do a human trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at least go for another couple of
weeks, maybe two months maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with Dr. Combs on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lentil is promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at this data and he was
surprised at how this pathogenic bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: actually reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not see much of the
bifidobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something wrong with our data
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to my prevent in South
Carolina child obesity, we call it tiger
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens because kids love the word tigers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can bring football players
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Pendleton Elementary School,
which is like five miles away from Clemson
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the garden at the first looked
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my kids go there with all the,
this is free labor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get three credits out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Creative Inquiry Program in
Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they design the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built the blueprints and then they
built the beds in the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is our irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like corrugated pipes and then
that's our irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how much water taken up by
the plant, and then it will evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We calculate the evapotranspiration and
all sort of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put the soil on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these all designed by the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is, this is how our beds look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each school get 12 to six type of beds,
depend on number of students, how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And students taken care of, we go to the
schools every Friday at lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Monday afternoons, I go talk to the
kids with the other students.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the garden club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how our radishes look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually they're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids, they're learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know what is kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many types of different kales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have a kale screening program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put all these good kales in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't even seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only seen dacquepo, like common kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they see that beautiful different
types, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Ikarda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work very closely with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we release about 15 to 12 high iron
sink varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're trying to do this selenium
project, because that is so important for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually this child is eating our
lentils that we release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want is agriculture as an
instrument for public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want is healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want healthy food and healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all my people that work with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good questions for Bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are your thoughts about the
different varieties and the selenium
[SPEAKER_04]: uptake?
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like for a lot of varieties,
the low selenium uptake and the high
[SPEAKER_04]: selenium uptake, the low and the high
application rates led to high selenium
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration and moderate application
rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because nobody has done that,
we want to be sure what is the best way,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we changed the rate and it's going
to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's dependent on how much selenium
you can absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have a whole different
rate compared to other programs connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have seen that in the kinds like
bicarbonate shots where you add and leave
[SPEAKER_01]: it on, it's more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these genotypes are made for America
or Canada, which is the high selenium
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the data that we publish from the
varieties that go into America,
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a different pattern for the
varieties actually in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing.
I've seen that.
But I don't have a clear answer for that.
It's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of selenium is because people are
in the glacier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of protection and a lot
of selenium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil concentration is almost one
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have done so many field work in
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, when I first published the
papers in May, when I started,
[SPEAKER_01]: they bought a qualification program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used that data to sell their
lentils as selenolentals because they get
[SPEAKER_00]: a high premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Germany and most of the European
countries, they buy these to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: selenolentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use that data in their bags,
saying selenolentals with this much
[SPEAKER_01]: selenium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to test those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you talk to Dr. Combs,
can we talk about that all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because yes, in some papers, it's all
about how much you eat, our portion size,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You eat like a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the power of US bread has a lot
of selenium, which is coming from North
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because his research program is all about,
like, he was the director of the USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: Human Nutrition Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they developed this tool that is like
an NIR machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can scan that much of selenium in
India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Combs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very interesting what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those starch molecules start
gelatinizing, and they start to meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the cooling process,
they start crystallizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, the resistant starch formation
happened in the heat generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much heat you apply, and how you
change the starch molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we published that data, and the process
is not very clear, but different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: starches can be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that the starch
formation that we see, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's starch formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, it shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have time for one long question or
two short questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's one short.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering, how much variation do you
see for protein in lentils?
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you think we're getting close?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 grams in 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, but how much variation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we're reaching an upper
limit?
[SPEAKER_05]: We reached the upper limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we want to gain more,
because then it is not lentils.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we would start having
interactions with absorption of other
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients if we were to try to go higher?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're talking about the saving?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you tried to increase protein
concentration of, say, a fairly common
[SPEAKER_05]: lentil variety, would that be
biochemically feasible?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would you start to have interactions
with absorption of other nutrients?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would there be health consequences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this kind of research has been done
in the 1980s in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they decided this is the maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the range is 20 to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the good lines, which has 28
grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think we want to push it
further, because it could create other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, there might happen to be
other compounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: white.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this all had to be balanced to 100,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: On that, I guess I'll go eat some lentils.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
