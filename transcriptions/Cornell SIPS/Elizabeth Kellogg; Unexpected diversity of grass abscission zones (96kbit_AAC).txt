[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today about diversity between species,
and I might echo some of the points that,
[SPEAKER_02]: or point that Avi made earlier today,
was finding that things were not working
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the same in Arabidopsis,
or perhaps not as well in Arabidopsis as
[SPEAKER_02]: they did in tomato, hinting that perhaps
different species do things a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the subtext of this talk is going
to be sort of whatever you thought was
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in one system may or may not be
happening in something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be talking specifically about
obsessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to define that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the process of releasing parts
from the parent plant, things falling off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh dear, something's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're most familiar with this in the
autumn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves fall off, fall off trees,
and petals obsides the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, dandelion fruits obsides pretty
much all the time, including when you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most famous story of obsession may
be the apple falling off the tree onto
[SPEAKER_02]: Isaac Newton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, the location of obsession
is not random.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not simple breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obsession occurs at a very specific
position, the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The obsession zone, which is here from a
diagram of the obsession zone at the base
[SPEAKER_02]: of a leaf, where it attaches to the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this little line of very small cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can form in different positions in
different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be the base of the leaf,
the base of the petals, below the fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: below the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that happens in a lot of
parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm going to be focusing
particularly on obsession below the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most familiar obsessions zones are in
the domesticated cereals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know this if you've studied
domestication at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the cereal crops, such as rice and
wheat and all the grasses, obsession and
[SPEAKER_02]: shedding of seeds is called shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, this wild wheat on the left
shatters as it breaks up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's obsession in very specific parts
of the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the process of domestication is a
loss of shattering, which was selected
[SPEAKER_02]: unconsciously by humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice if you're going out and selecting
as this guy is here harvesting with a
[SPEAKER_02]: scythe, and then as these women are doing
here wrapping the stalks into sheaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously what you're doing is you're
selecting for plants in which there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: obsession.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the seeds are on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any seeds that are falling off end up in
the mud and you don't collect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're automatically selecting for
the loss of shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably took quite a while for this
set of mutations to get fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically what it means is that all
the domesticated cereals are natural
[SPEAKER_02]: mutants in which shattering is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mutations that disable the obsession
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of what we know about obsession
zones come from these wild domesticated
[SPEAKER_02]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be referring to a number of these
through the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other reason why this is important is
that there's a lot of focus on improving
[SPEAKER_02]: novel crops that also need to be selected
to reduce or completely eliminate
[SPEAKER_02]: shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've just put two here that we're
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be talking about this
work in this talk particularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Funio is a species of digitaria,
which is edible and is grown as a crop in
[SPEAKER_02]: some parts of Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teff is probably more widely cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those drop their seeds,
although Teff sort of holds onto them a
[SPEAKER_02]: little better than Funio does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if you're selecting for yield in
these crops, if you want to do that to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve them, you've got to reduce
shattering first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise if you lose the seeds,
then it doesn't matter how wonderfully
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritious or large that seed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sitting there in the mud and
you're not going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an important target for selection
and crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of introduction to the
grass family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's familiar to many of you here,
but just to remind you, it is a large
[SPEAKER_02]: plant family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 12,000 species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 700 or more than 700 genera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've just put four of them across the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the big three are rice,
wheat, and maize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put sorghum and millet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to introduce you to just a little
bit of grass floral anatomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much, but some.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grass flowers are raised in little
spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these little structures known as
spikelets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a spikelet right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series of bracts surrounding a
fairly conventional flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The outer bracts subtend the spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two outer bracts,
and then one flower, two flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: three flower, four, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: These outer bracts are known as glooms,
which is of course, when people study
[SPEAKER_02]: grasses, they get depressed about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People call it the gloomy flurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two glooms are subtending the spikelet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bit of morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll need to refer to for this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's another picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's first gloom, second gloom,
and then the flowers are above that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the glooms sort of demarcate the bottom
of the spikelet.
[SPEAKER_02]: In rice, the obsession zone forms above
the gloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the glooms are these tiny little
structures here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red dotted line marks the obsession
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the spikelet breaks one
obsession, occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The glooms stay on the plant, these two
little flaps, and then the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower and the seed and everything falls
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can show that in this little
diagram where it made the glooms in blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the obsession zone is red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are a couple in rice,
a couple of sterile flowers, and the big
[SPEAKER_02]: fertile flower is shown as this big green
egg-like thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at something like
Brachypodium, there's also obsession above
[SPEAKER_02]: the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the glooms at the bottom,
these little blue things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got multiple flowers in
Brachypodium, and there's an obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: zone forms between each set of flowers,
but still above the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at something like millet or
Panicum like switchgrass, on the other
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, the obsession is below the gloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a gloom, and the thing breaks
off, the spikelet falls off entire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nothing, there are no branch
left on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a couple of blue glooms
here, and then an obsession zone right
[SPEAKER_02]: below it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some things that I've just showed
you, you've got an obsession above the
[SPEAKER_02]: glooms, and some, it's below the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does that sort out across the grass
family?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Yunqing Yu, who's a postdoc in my
lab, just characterized a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: grasses based on stuff from the literature
and her own observations, and then mapped
[SPEAKER_02]: the position of the obsession zone onto
the grass phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so blue, is the obsession above the
glooms, that's like rice in Brachypodium,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I just showed you, here's rice,
here's Brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to be the ancestral
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these things where there's an
obsession below the glooms, like Ceteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: is shown here in green, and that's a
derived condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are a few things that
you're familiar with, like Tayasinte or
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat in which there's obsession actually
in the stalk of the plant, that's shown
[SPEAKER_02]: here on red.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for most of what I'm gonna be talking
about today, we're just looking at this
[SPEAKER_02]: simple transition, simple transition
between below the glooms and above the
[SPEAKER_02]: glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the ancestral condition there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this raises a really obvious question
from the point of view of genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question is, is there just a
single obsession zone module that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant sort of just moves around depending
on where it's gonna form?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a single gem module conserved,
and then maybe the transcription factor or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that sort of says, oh,
I'll put it here or put it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this would be expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be one possible explanation of
the evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the question I'm gonna be
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: First starting with simply histology,
that is cutting sections right through the
[SPEAKER_02]: obsession zone to see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to QTL studies and genome-wide
association studies, and to RNAC,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to address this relatively
straightforward question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with the histology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what we know comes from rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of work on obsession
that is shattering in rice, comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated rice with its wild,
shattering relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly in Asia, the wild rice,
which shatters, is a real problem in
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, because obviously then it's
dropping seeds to produce weeds and get in
[SPEAKER_02]: the field and compete with a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we take a vertical section right
down through here, so a longitudinal
[SPEAKER_02]: section, we just slice it down through and
stain it, what you get is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, we've done this in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these pictures are from my lab,
but they're pictures in the literature
[SPEAKER_02]: that are very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the obsession zone, the place where
things actually break, is this little line
[SPEAKER_02]: of cells right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, I need to introduce you to a few
histological stains so you know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: colors mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is stained with safranin O and
fast green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And safranin O stains both lignin and
suberin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pink indicates lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the obsession zone itself is not
lignified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the obsession zone here,
both sides, and this is a vascular strand
[SPEAKER_02]: going down, connecting the bottom of the
spikelet down to the rest of the stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lignin and no lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another stained fluoroglucinol
HCl, which is much more specific for just
[SPEAKER_02]: lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get basically the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the place where it actually breaks is
this zone of small thin-walled cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if you have trouble seeing it,
I've just drawn a squiggly little line and
[SPEAKER_02]: the squiggles mean nothing other than the
fact that I can't draw very well on a
[SPEAKER_02]: mouse pad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have looked at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one paper from the literature
looking at the African rice compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amelia mutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's obviously we've now got acridine
orange, which is also still staining
[SPEAKER_02]: lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just now green.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in one of the non-shattering mutants
in the domesticate, lignin now extends all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way across the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just doesn't have that break point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that suggests then that a functional
obsession zone requires a narrow layer of
[SPEAKER_02]: small cells and differential
lignification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is sort of if you look up
obsession zone in the literature,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is sort of the description you will
get is that you've got to have different
[SPEAKER_02]: lignification and then this narrow layer
of small cells defining the break point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that suggested the fairly
straightforward set of experiments,
[SPEAKER_02]: which turned out to be really good for
summer undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend anatomy and histology
if you've got summer interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they get to look at something
nobody else has ever looked at before and
[SPEAKER_02]: make a discovery and produce some pretty
interesting data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rachel Tavares, who was an undergrad
intern, now grad student at UMass,
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at Brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an obsession we call above the
glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expected it was going to be just like
rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expected we'd have this same rice type
obsession zone in between the flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: above the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Rachel looked at Brachypodium
distachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what she discovered indeed was this
nice little line of small cells right
[SPEAKER_02]: here, very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the staining,
this is saffron and no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pink means lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you discover is that the pattern is
exactly backwards of what I just showed
[SPEAKER_02]: you in rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the rice, lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the obsession zone itself is
non-lignified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Brachypodium, the obsession zone
itself is heavily lignified and not on
[SPEAKER_02]: either side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this other more specific lignin
stain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was distressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we thought, oh, well, there's still a
nice little line of thin walled cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about obsession below the glooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this was studied by John Hodge,
who was a master's student in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's now a PhD candidate at Oklahoma
State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John got looking at the obsession zone
in Ceteria viridis, which is closely
[SPEAKER_02]: related to switchgrass, and phonium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's looking at this region right at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The obsession zone is right here,
right below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sectional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sectioning right through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put this embryo over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a mature grass embryo just to
prove to you that this spikelet really is
[SPEAKER_02]: mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that we got the sage wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is basically no little line of cells
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've looked at enough of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this dotted line on just to show you
where it breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've looked at enough to know that's
where it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not seeing any clearly
different differentiated obsession zone at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you stain it with these,
like saffron and o, here's the lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just around the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put brachypodium next to it just so
you can see the comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the brachypodium obsession zone,
which, remember, is the inverse of the
[SPEAKER_02]: rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you stain it with agradine
orange, it's not just the stain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the lignin out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the lignin, of course,
in the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this thing breaks right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is no cellular differentiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stained with DAPI, which lets you
know where the nuclei are and points out
[SPEAKER_02]: live cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cells are alive right through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing's dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to spend too much time on
this one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've done a number of other
approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still can't figure out what it is that
marks the obsession zone in this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to summarize the histology,
histological comparisons among these three
[SPEAKER_02]: species, in rice and brachypodium,
yeah, we've got this canonical obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: zone where the obsession zone cells are
significantly smaller than the surrounding
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ceteria, once you know where to look,
they are slightly smaller, but not
[SPEAKER_02]: compellingly so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Differential lignification, definitely in
rice and brachy, but not ceteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the obsession zone itself not
lignified in rice and ceteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not seeing a lot of conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we then tried to rescue that with
another hypothesis and said, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe each one of these things is in a
different clade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least it's representative of the
clade so that everything that's related to
[SPEAKER_02]: ceteria will have a ceteria obsession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our undergraduate intern last
summer was Patricia Leyva, who decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: get serious about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, fine, just section everything
you can get hold of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turned out everything she could
get hold of and she could get through in a
[SPEAKER_02]: short period of time was an enormous
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all these species that are up here
that she's actually looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to walk you through
every single species, but there they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not lignified at all either side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's brachypodium, which you've
already seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is teff over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And teff actually breaks right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to figure out whether that tracked the
phylogeny, she simply mapped all these
[SPEAKER_02]: characters onto a pruned grass phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just look at the position,
that's coded as basically one is above the
[SPEAKER_02]: glooms and two is below the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that isn't consistent within any,
it doesn't match the phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of having the tiny little cells,
one is having small cells and two is not
[SPEAKER_02]: having a set of small cells, that doesn't
match.
[SPEAKER_02]: And D is the cell wall pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So green means not lignified and pink
means is the color of the stain,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't track the phylogeny at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the question we're trying
to answer, if we look at histology,
[SPEAKER_02]: the answer is no, there is no conservation
in the structure of the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was not great, but you start
thinking, well, maybe there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying genetic conservation,
even though there's no histological
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation and RNAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look at QTL studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly there've been a lot of them,
particularly in rice, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've identified several genes that
control the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few years ago, our colleague Andrew
Doust wrote a review paper in the American
[SPEAKER_02]: Journal of Botany where he took the rice
chromosomes and put on them just the
[SPEAKER_02]: location of the QTL from all the published
studies up to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: QTL are here in these black boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the genes are listed under here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll not be mentioning too many of the
gene names today, but they've been well
[SPEAKER_02]: localized and some of the genes have been
cloned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question is then, what does it
look like when you put other species on
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So red is zia, green is sorghum,
brown is ceteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see just by looking at how
the colors line up is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not much overlap except in this
one region here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of stuff that seems to be unique
to rice, a lot of stuff that's unique to
[SPEAKER_02]: the other species, possibly some
similarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that region of similarity seems to all
cover this one Gabby transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is known as shattering one,
which was originally identified in a
[SPEAKER_02]: sorghum cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: As shown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be mentioning, focusing on only a
couple of genes today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one, if you can hang on to this
name, the Gabby gene of shattering one
[SPEAKER_02]: that is shared across a lot of different
species in these QTL studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that raises a question about natural
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember I started out by saying,
our ancestors who domesticated all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cereals were selecting unconsciously from
standing variation in wild plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that was gonna work, I mean,
we know it did work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have to be non-shattering mutations
that are relatively common in wild
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the mutations aren't there,
then it doesn't matter how much you select
[SPEAKER_02]: on them, you don't get anywhere with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody's actually surveyed a very
large set of wild germplasm for reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: shattering and then gone on to clone a
gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna tell you about doing that
now, because we've did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant that we looked at was green
millet, which is Ceteria viridis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's shown here growing in its natural
habitat in the United States, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: right next to a highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the tarmac over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very weedy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we collected it pretty widely
throughout the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and got hold of some material outside of
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small diploid plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been being used as a model for a
number of things, particularly for studies
[SPEAKER_02]: of C4 photosynthesis, because it's
diploid, it's rapid cycling, it can be
[SPEAKER_02]: transformed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quite a few labs are using that,
using this as a model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite recently, we've been involved,
we, I should say, is actually folks at
[SPEAKER_02]: JGI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this group led by Jeremy Schmutz have
produced a new assembly of a reference
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was an old version, and this is
an updated much better version,
[SPEAKER_02]: line known as A10, which I may mentioned
during this talk a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really nice assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically all-line chromosomes and
relatively small number of contigs with a
[SPEAKER_02]: real good N50.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this really lovely assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as part of that project, we also
collected and sequenced 598 diverse lines
[SPEAKER_02]: from, particularly from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Canada, as well as elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm putting this map up here for a
couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is when you're working on natural
diversity, in most cases, you don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: gene bank to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it, you go get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yellow dots are trips that,
well, I did that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people from my lab made, over a period
of several years, Max Feldman from Ivan
[SPEAKER_02]: Baxter's lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did all the blue loops, and then green and
red was from Puhuang.
[SPEAKER_02]: This map also shows something else,
and that is, of course, that St. Louis is
[SPEAKER_02]: the center of the universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that Ceteria viridis is very
weedy and grows really well along
[SPEAKER_02]: interstate highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the people formerly from my lab I
do need to give a shout out to is a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: named Matt Estep, who's now at Appalachian
State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did the collecting all the way up
to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is another one of the reference
lines that I'll probably mention,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least once, called ME 034 that is very
widely used now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ME stands for Matt Estep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his line is becoming very widely used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the JGI sequenced
[SPEAKER_02]: libraries for each of these things,
covered to very high coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one has been assembled de novo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got a lot of SNPs, did a lot of
presence-absence variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: 98% of the genes are shared among all the
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done a bunch of Adam Healy and
Sujan Mamidi at the JGI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hudson Alpha have done a lot of population
genetics on this, which I'm only just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to mention more in passing for this
talk, but there's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Population genetic analysis shows four
major introductions from the old world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the stuff in pink we're calling
the central population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is genetically very similar to
material from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue is very similar to things from
southern Europe and Turkey, sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: caucuses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green, there's the northern population,
which also extends across Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the orange and the west
coast population, which is also parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: the western Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of introductions from the old
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Puhuang, who's now at BASF,
phenotyped a subset of these lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: about 200 of them, and assessed them for
shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a bunch of plants over here,
and you can see there's a big pile of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, spikelets, that have fallen off,
obviously a very high-shattering pile of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, he did a genome-wide
association analysis, which identified a
[SPEAKER_02]: single peak, right here, covering a pretty
large QTL, but it didn't cover any
[SPEAKER_02]: previously known shattering locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of the stuff from rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he did find, was he managed by
various combinations of tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: was a causal gene, which we're calling
less-shattering one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it reduces shattering,
it doesn't completely abolish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an uncharacterized MIB.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a high-shattering line,
which happens to be like ME34,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a low-shattering line,
which is the reference, in which there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: point mutation that causes a
non-conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amino acid substitution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to validate that, this was knocked out
with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the wild-type allele over here,
free-shattering, and then the CRISPR line
[SPEAKER_02]: is substantially less-shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's not a complete
abolishment of shattering, but it's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we validated that by measuring the
strength of the obsession zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a technique that's used
frequently in this approach, where you
[SPEAKER_02]: take the inflorescence and hang it upside
down on a force gauge, and then grab one
[SPEAKER_02]: spikelet with a pair of tweezers and pull,
and the breaking force required for the
[SPEAKER_02]: obsession zone turns up on the force
gauge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very boring experiment,
but it gives you pretty good data,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is shown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the tensile strength of the
obsession zone, the high-shattering
[SPEAKER_02]: wild-type, this is ME34, shown in red,
and you can see after, did about 18 days
[SPEAKER_02]: after heading, it's dropped close to zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: The slightly lower-shattering wild allele
does shatter, but later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the CRISPR line, the tensile
strength, stays very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So changeover development validated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also found that the
domesticated version of green millet,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is foxtail millet, so this is the
wild one, this is the domesticated,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually has a transposon in less form
that appears to disable it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems to be a gene that has
contributed to domestication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously can't be the whole story because
it's not a complete non-shattering
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, let's just then go back to some
QTL studies that have been done by
[SPEAKER_02]: colleagues and also published,
and the question is, does it fall under
[SPEAKER_02]: any known QTL for shattering?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, is it a domestication gene?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a QTL map of shattering from an
RI line that was made in, Andrew Doust
[SPEAKER_02]: made, and has developed in his lab between
a wild C.
[SPEAKER_02]: teria viridis and the cultivated foxtail
millet.
[SPEAKER_02]: SH1, which I mentioned to you earlier,
the one that comes up in all the other QTL
[SPEAKER_02]: studies is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question is, does less one fall
under this chromosome five?
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not less one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less one is actually over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're thinking right now is that
the transposon in less one probably
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced shattering and may have been
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Involved in early domestication,
but then subsequent much stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: mutations were involved in actually
producing this completely non-shattering
[SPEAKER_02]: domestic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to summarize the C.
[SPEAKER_02]: teria genome wide association studies,
we've got a high quality genome,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of wild diversity, a lot of good
population genetics, and then use GWAS
[SPEAKER_02]: from that to find a novel domestication
locus which was validated with CRISPR and
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously produces a resource for other,
exploring other traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this does is it adds a species
specific gene to the list of genes from
[SPEAKER_02]: other species in other QTL studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just talked about less one and these
other ones, again, I'm not going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through them in detail, but what you'll
see is that they're each one, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: rice lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems to be specific particularly
rice, this is rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are triticeae only,
that's wheat and barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only SH1 seems to be in multiple
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're seeing is then is that from
these QTL and GWAS studies, the controls
[SPEAKER_02]: of obsession appear to vary among species.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this kind of work is not designed
to get you the whole network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's quite possible that there is
indeed a concerted network that's moved
[SPEAKER_02]: around the plant, which is where we
started, of course, but we've just found a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot of different ways to break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we say is less one involved in
chattering and other species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll come back to that in a little
bit, in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've shown is from based on
getting back to our original question,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the question of the histology,
there's no conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: From QTL and GWAS, it's inconclusive,
maybe shattering one neabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, what's the thing to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is to do RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was a collaboration led by
Yenching Liu in my lab and with Hao Hu and
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Daust at Oklahoma State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember that we have rice breaking
above the glooms, bracket podium between
[SPEAKER_02]: the flowers, and Ceteria, the obsession
zone, below the glooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Yenching did was dissected out the
region of the obsession zone for each of
[SPEAKER_02]: those three species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've seen all these so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: She dissected out the regions roughly with
this orange box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a sort of internal control,
she looked at the area right below the
[SPEAKER_02]: lower region and the area right above,
that is the upper region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it could compare the genes that are
expressed in the obsession zone to the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones above and below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Venn diagram simply shows that
the set of one-to-one orthologs is largely
[SPEAKER_02]: the same among all species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the set of genes that are expressed in
that region is shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the question is, which ones of
those are specifically restricted to the
[SPEAKER_02]: obsession zone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did a bunch of different analyses,
Yenching and Hao did a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just showing you the results of WGCNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to walk you through this diagram
here, what we have is a heat map of
[SPEAKER_02]: expression levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are three replicates for below the
glooms, three replicates within the
[SPEAKER_02]: obsession zone, and three replicates above
the obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a young developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the same set of replicates below
the obsession zone and above the obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: zone at an old developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this particular cluster in rice,
there are about 3,000 genes that are
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly distinguishing the young stage
from the old stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're up at the young stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're down at the old stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each species has modules that look
like that, and they overlap significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the 3,000 ones I just showed
you in rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about 2,200 in bracket podium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the overlap among those is about 850
genes that are differentially expressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: shared between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly significant overlap, suggesting
there's a lot of similarity in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, what we want to know is
what's happening with the obsession zone
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a rice set of genes that are
highly expressed in the obsession zone at
[SPEAKER_02]: the young developmental stage,
much higher in the obsession zone than
[SPEAKER_02]: either below or above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, every species has a couple of
obsession zone-specific modules at
[SPEAKER_02]: particular developmental stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question, then, that Yim-Ching and
Hao asked was, what's shared among these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a set of 962.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's bracket podium.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 111.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is shared between those modules?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is basically nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of overlap,
which is barely statistically significant,
[SPEAKER_02]: given the number of comparisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very low numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, what we really want is the
three-way overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are three genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a miB, there's a lysine
decarboxylase, about which we know
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing, and cumerate ligase, which is
presumably involved in lignin formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first thought was, well,
maybe we just messed up the analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should be considering analyzing
things slightly differently in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: which genes we included and how we did the
comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a completely different analysis,
and we got exactly the same result.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the second analysis, we only got
two things overlapping, although they were
[SPEAKER_02]: two of the same ones we saw in the first
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the miB, highly expressed in the
obsession zone at a young stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the lysine decarboxylase, also among
all three species.
[SPEAKER_02]: The expression domain of this miB is in
the obsession zone, so that's good,
[SPEAKER_02]: in two of the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't pick it up in C.
[SPEAKER_02]: terria, which either means that the
RNA-seq is misleading or this method in
[SPEAKER_02]: situ is not sensitive enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be thinking, well, what happened
to less one?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is it wasn't in this
analysis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was not differentially
expressed in anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in C.
[SPEAKER_02]: terria viridis, very low-level expression
in rice, and not expressed at all in
[SPEAKER_02]: brachypodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's not only species-specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it's doing is probably not
specific to the obsession zone and the
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on shattering, maybe a byproduct of
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go back to the known genes,
the genes that have been known in rice,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are ones that have been identified
in the literature, and they're obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: zone-specific in rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at those same genes in the
obsession modules as to where they fall in
[SPEAKER_02]: the other species, they're not always even
in an obsession module in the other
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking that perhaps we needed to look
earlier in development, and Yuncheng did a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of in situ hybridization at earlier
stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this oldest stage of in situ
hybridization was the youngest stage from
[SPEAKER_02]: the RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see very clearly gene expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens to be apetala 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it at the earlier stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is confirming published data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we look at the other two
species, there's no expression there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put the, that's where the obsession
zone is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see is that they're
really just, it's not, simply not
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in the obsession zone and the
other species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing for other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we get back then to the question
that we started with, is the obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: zone conserved by a developmental,
controlled by a conserved developmental
[SPEAKER_02]: module?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is histologically no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The QTL is inconclusive, maybe SH1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And RNA-seq points to only two genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at SH1, it's mutated in many
domesticated cereals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, as with everything else,
we don't know what any of these things do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's SH1 in situ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm gonna skip that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the gene networks differ among
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although it may be a conserved
component of the network, its specific
[SPEAKER_02]: role may be differing between species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overall answer to the question is
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The set of genes involved in the obsession
zone is largely shared, but how they are
[SPEAKER_02]: deployed is mostly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The practical implications of this are,
mean that for improving the orphan crops
[SPEAKER_02]: remember I talked about Teflonio right at
the beginning, or novel crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like perennial wheatgrass,
for any of that improvement cannot proceed
[SPEAKER_02]: without reducing shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these networks are species specific,
we need to study each crop individually as
[SPEAKER_02]: to how it actually is put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: SH1, MIB26 may be exceptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're certainly pursuing looking at
those to see how they are deployed,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly in Teflonio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that we're pursuing is
exactly how they work, because that at the
[SPEAKER_02]: cell level is not known.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, we're thinking that most of
the genes that are necessary for obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably establishing development of
the spikelet and the pedicel rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling obsession per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is if you affect spikelet development
or pedicel development, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: an effect on the obsession zone sort of
indirectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the obsession zone itself may be
controlled by only a handful of genes or
[SPEAKER_02]: may be deployed only at the very last
minute before obsession, or it may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: transcriptionally regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'm gonna stop and thank the
team particularly at Hudson Alpha,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who did a lot of the work on
the Ceteria genome and all the diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: work and the GWAS studies, a great bunch
of people to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is my lab at the Danforth
Plant Science Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what I talked about today was work
of Yen-Shing Yu, and yes, that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Stanley Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to thank you for all your
attention and thanks again to the
[SPEAKER_02]: organizers for putting together a great
symposium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Toby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see we already have a few questions
in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the first one was from
Hannah Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna unmute yourself and ask that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was interested in that map that you had
shown earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized that it was a basic
question from some perspectives,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I was thinking about it in terms of
ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very loud where I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about it from an ecological
point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering, do you think that
maybe you could find more homologs to
[SPEAKER_03]: important genes near the Illinois area
where a lot of the species seem to radiate
[SPEAKER_03]: out from?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we included, I mean, every one of
them has been sequenced in detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've certainly looked at the whole
array because there's not only been a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of introduction, a lot of the
introductions seem to be in that part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Midwest, but there's also been a lot
of admixture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that could be an introduction or an
interesting place to look at more closely
[SPEAKER_02]: and specifically look at the admixt lines
in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is very cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps there would be something unique
that would have popped up later on as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to closer to the epicenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I think the one thing is that
the epicenter is partly driven by the
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction history of this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have a real good picture of
the diversification across Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sampling is just super sparse there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think your question probably would
be really interesting to address closer to
[SPEAKER_02]: where the species is actually native.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be where you actually see a
better signature of the ecological
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Anne.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we have another question from
LN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you plan to automate your tensile
experiments in the future?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's really cool work.
[SPEAKER_08]: But someone pulling it by hand may affect
the quality of results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it also affects the enthusiasm of the
person doing the pulling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not a great experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried other assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other ways of estimating how many
seeds fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Counting seeds or weighing them and that
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tensile strength is very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quantitative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, if we had a way to do that more
easily, it certainly would be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't been able to come up with
a... The challenging part is simply
[SPEAKER_02]: getting hold of the spike work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there was a way to grab it in some
good way, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you have any ideas,
I'd be happy to hear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it looks like there's a question
from Steven Merrick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was wondering about if you looked
at any of the microRNAs or small RNAs in
[SPEAKER_05]: the abscission zone region and if they
have any homology to any of the identified
[SPEAKER_05]: differential express genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or their UTRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something we've thought about and
just haven't made the libraries to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we're going forward, we are almost
certainly going to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a little of two genes which do
come up in some of these species are
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated by microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess the answer to your
question is no, we haven't done it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yes, we'd love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a question from Jim
Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Toby.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering about looking at genera
where there's variation within the genus
[SPEAKER_04]: for where the shattering occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my recollection was in a vein that
different species will shatter at
[SPEAKER_04]: different places in the floral structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if you've looked at cases
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly with Avino that you're right,
the different cultivated lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: different species do break up in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also true with the wheat and
barley relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just break in different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had gone into this assuming
there was just going to be a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: conserved network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we hadn't really dug into the
within species diversity, but given what
[SPEAKER_02]: we know now, that might definitely be
worth pursuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Doyle, you want to go ahead and ask
your question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Toby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is cell death involved in incision?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the literature is ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it isn't involved, it's pretty
late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, some species, and I think
there's a work in Leachie where obsession
[SPEAKER_02]: of one cell layer from another involves
cell death.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the cereal crops, the assumption,
which I think hasn't been very well
[SPEAKER_02]: tested, the assumption is that it's an
active process.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, the cells right there at the
obsession zone actually secrete cellulases
[SPEAKER_02]: and pectin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pectinases out to dissolve the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't obviously do that unless
they're alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may not, you know, cell death may
not be involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: The exception may be in TEF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the place where TEF breaks,
it actually looks like those cells just
[SPEAKER_02]: fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes necrotic or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess the answer to your
question is, if you don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess I was just thinking that
maybe that would be something,
[SPEAKER_06]: a process that would be, you know,
sort of difficult to detect by any of the
[SPEAKER_06]: histological methods or RNA-seq,
but could account for some program in
[SPEAKER_06]: there that would actually cause a group of
cells to die and create that break point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may actually be a good
possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the challenges of this is once
you start focusing on things like the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual breaking process itself,
it gets hard to study because the things
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things just fall apart on you as you're
trying to work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think that's a really,
really good possibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also a question from Chelsea
Specht.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Toby, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I was also thinking like Jeff
about program cell death and also going
[SPEAKER_00]: back in my head as what are the processes
to study that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of it was with nectaries
where things start to degrade and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with an abscission zone, it's
different in that you don't get that
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular secretion along with the death.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually get, I don't know,
you were just saying the cells kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: break apart or they lose their cell walls,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of dry up, I guess, for lack of
a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was thinking about the signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any way to detect some kind of,
I don't know if it would be signaling or
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone or some sort of small molecule
that might be involved with setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular zone where the cells then are
no longer involved in growth, but rather
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow are enzymatically broken apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think there's got to be
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently focusing on a couple of
things because we actually have a CRISPR
[SPEAKER_02]: mutant for SH1 that Yuncheng can compare
between wild-type and mutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're focusing on cell wall structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the distribution and possible
breakdown of the various carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pectins and the xylaglucans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there seems to be a hormonal
response involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, it's kind of watch this
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data are too preliminary to talk
about, but yes, I think the situation you
[SPEAKER_02]: just outlined may well be what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really interesting and I really
appreciate your real rigor and efforts in
[SPEAKER_00]: looking across all these grasses and
finding that every time you look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's challenging, it's also
incredibly exciting to think about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that grasses have come to the same
conclusion, but doing it differently to
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about ecologically what
differences that might make or what these
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to be and what adaptation these
plants might be using this differential
[SPEAKER_00]: response to evolve towards is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an evolutionary point of view,
it actually makes no sense because all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things have obsession zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, you know, I mean,
if you use a strictly sort of phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_02]: definition of homology, they're,
you know, they're homologous in the sense
[SPEAKER_02]: that they all go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has an obsession zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got it perfectly,
why move it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Jeff, you have another
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just occurred to me, you know,
when you were showing all those really
[SPEAKER_06]: nice histological pictures about how,
how variable different species were,
[SPEAKER_06]: it makes me wonder, do you see that same,
a lot of that same variation perhaps
[SPEAKER_06]: within a species?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did your student look within a species to
see how variable that was at that level?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't met that sort of follows,
you know, Jim Helen's suggestion is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there are species that do vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just haven't drilled down to that,
that level of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but yeah, I mean, I think that starts
to be, you know, it wouldn't have occurred
[SPEAKER_02]: to me that genetically or histologically,
there would be variation within a species
[SPEAKER_02]: for obsession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we know the position of it can
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that we're finding this amount of
diversity, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would, would be one,
one way to go be to, to look within a
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I wasn't thinking so much of
position as Jim question, but actually the
[SPEAKER_06]: dignification and you know, like all the
whole suite of characters, the different
[SPEAKER_06]: types that you refer to essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually something variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
