[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we have Laura Kaminski.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura is from Rochester, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her scientific mentors are Terry Bell,
Grant Thompson, and Jenny Kahn-Niffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her post-graduation plans, she's going to
be doing a six-month-long apprenticeship
[SPEAKER_01]: at Devon Point Farm in Connecticut,
and then will begin a PhD program in
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental microbiology at Penn State
in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of Laura's talk today is
Phosphorus and the Soil Microbiome of
Alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Laura, and today I'll be
talking about my senior honors thesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did in the Kahn-Niffin lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a variety of soil ecology
techniques to study microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a microbiome is just the collection of
all the bacteria and fungi in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with each other and
interacting with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the composition and activity of those
microbiomes can have really profound
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on plant phenotypes and plant
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically in my study, I looked at
how phosphorus fertilization impacts that
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction and plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this talk, I'll first go over the
background that led me to develop this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll then discuss the methods I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over just a couple of my results
and the conclusions that we can gain from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off, a brief overview of the
phosphorus cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants require phosphorus in this form,
the phosphate iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take it up through their roots
from the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most phosphorus in the soil
exists in some other form that's
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccessible to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this includes large organic molecules
that have phosphorus in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphate iodine can become bound to
soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also precipitate out a solution
in these insoluble complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, microbes are really good at
turning those inaccessible forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus back into the phosphate iodine,
which plants can then use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, microbes are also really
important in helping plants scavenge those
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate ions once they're available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form a
symbiosis with plant roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously colonize a larger volume of
the soil than plants could reach on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all told, microbes are very important
for making this phosphate ion available
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping plants acquire it once it's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we as humans just bypass this
whole cycle in our agricultural systems by
[SPEAKER_00]: directly applying inorganic fertilizers to
our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with this is that that
phosphate ion applied to the soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly turn back into those
inaccessible forms, such that only 10% to
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of what's applied is actually taken up
by the plants and the rest remains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine that over the years,
this can cause phosphorus to build to
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really high levels in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a well-documented issue for
water quality, because if that soil runs
[SPEAKER_00]: off into water, that influx of nutrients
can cause algal blooms and fish kills and
[SPEAKER_00]: a host of other problems in those
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that is a little bit less
researched is what is all of that excess
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus doing to the soil microbes that
are so important for phosphorus cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: especially?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important question for
sustainable agriculture, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning to more sustainable forms of
nutrient management, because we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to increasingly rely on these
microbes as opposed to these fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: which come from a non-renewable source and
require a lot of energy to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in how the previous
fertilization management techniques may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been affecting the microbes which
we're going to need in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the basis for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I addressed this question with four
different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was just field soil from one of
Cornell's farms mixed with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss to lighten it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to that base soil mix,
I had three phosphorus addition
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was a compost addition to add an
organic form of phosphorus, one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccessible forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just acquired from Cornell
farm services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had two inorganic phosphorus
treatments adding triple super phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just a very concentrated form of
that phosphate ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was a relatively moderate rate
of triple super phosphate and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: was designed to just be completely
ridiculous and overload the soil with more
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus than the plants could possibly
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were my four soil treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to those four soil treatments,
I applied a multi-generation conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: of a common starting microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this meant was I had 20 replicate
pots of each treatment and in them I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa, which is just important forage
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also used as a cover crop because
it's a legume and it fixes nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an important crop in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have 20 pots of alfalfa per each
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those for three weeks and then I
harvested the plants and I dried them down
[SPEAKER_00]: and I collected the above ground biomass
and I identified the four pots with the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest biomass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those pots, I took the soil,
I took the microbiome and I transplanted
[SPEAKER_00]: that into a steam sterilized soil of the
same treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose to propagate the microbiomes
that were associated with the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth for each of the four
treatments separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this method has been used recently to
show that you can actually alter plant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits in this way without changing plant
genotypes at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't end up happening in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I didn't end up improving biomass
by selecting the microbiome in this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was the basic idea behind this
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so at the end of four generations,
of conditioning, I ended up with four
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct microbiomes and to these I
performed a reciprocal transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just means that I put each of the
four different microbiomes into each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the four different soil types for a total
of 16 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why did I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was really interested in the
effect of having microbiomes of different
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions and seeing if those different
microbiomes had different effects on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with my setup was that the
different soil treatments also had
[SPEAKER_00]: different abiotic properties and those
separately affected plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the plants grown with
compost would grow differently than plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grown just in the base soil mix,
just on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, that compost is also
altering soil properties in such a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that the microbiome is responding and
altering as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that altered microbiome is having
a secondary effect altering plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that second effect that I'm
interested in, but it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: tease it apart just as my experimental
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we correct this with their reciprocal
transplant by putting four different
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes into the same abiotic soil
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you see at the same time
differences in plant growth, you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably sure that the effect is because
of the microbiome and not because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the basis behind the
reciprocal transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hypotheses for this experiment were
that at the end of my four generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of conditioning microbiomes,
I would indeed have four distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have different compositions and
different enzyme activities, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought that this distinct
community fingerprint would be maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: in the reciprocal transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even when these distinct microbiomes
are put into new soils, they maintain some
[SPEAKER_00]: of their characteristic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought that for any given soil in
the reciprocal transplant, the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: would perform the best would be the one
that is grown with the microbiome that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already adapted to that soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in the compost soil,
I thought that plants would grow best when
[SPEAKER_00]: they were grown with microbiomes already
adapted to the compost soil, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes that were adapted to one of
the inorganic phosphorus treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I collected a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: all today, but I characterized the
microbiome two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I sequenced the 16S RNA gene,
which just gives me a snapshot of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial diversity that's present in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also measured extracellular enzyme
activity just to get a sense of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: balance and nutrient needs of that
microbiome ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plants, for the alfalfa, I measured
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the reciprocal transplant only,
I also measured nodulation of alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, and I measured plant mineral
concentrations of carbon, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'll really just be talking
about the sequencing data and the biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: data from their reciprocal transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very quickly, my first hypothesis was
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of my four generations of
conditioning, I had four distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes, and they were distinct both
in bacterial community composition and in
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the sequencing data for the
reciprocal transplant relating to my
[SPEAKER_00]: second hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is is a principal coordinate
analysis graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what it does is it
condenses that enormous amount of data
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have on bacterial species that are
present in the soil for each sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It condenses that huge multivariate data
set into two axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when two points are closer together
on the graph, that means that their
[SPEAKER_00]: community composition is more similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're further apart,
it means their community composition is
[SPEAKER_00]: more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So points are colored on this graph by
their microbiome history.
[SPEAKER_00]: What soil were they present in for the
four generations of selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then points are shaped by which soil
they are currently in for their reciprocal
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you notice is that
points cluster most closely with other
[SPEAKER_00]: points that are the same color and the
same shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're most similar to other
microbiomes that are in the same cross
[SPEAKER_00]: within the reciprocal transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more broadly, points cluster by their
current soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, all the microbiomes that
are currently in a control soil cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: together here, no matter their microbiome
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is true of the compost-dependent
soil, and the same is true of the low
[SPEAKER_00]: inorganic phosphorus soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exception to this pattern,
as you may have noticed, are the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are from historically highly
fertilized soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form this broader cluster with every
microbiome that is currently or has in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past been in that really highly fertilized
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they maintained their
extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in relation to my second hypothesis,
it was only those high inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus microbiomes that maintained
their extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of them converged pretty
rapidly in community composition when put
[SPEAKER_00]: into a new soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this relate to the biomass and
plant performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of all my replicate
fives from their reciprocal transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a random subset of my pots
representing each of the 16 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pots are arranged in rows by their soil
treatment and in columns by the microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: that was transplanted into that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you'll notice,
and here I'll be flashing my biomass data
[SPEAKER_00]: panels up to the right, and I'll show you
that data again in the next slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just so you can orient those panels to
this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you'll notice is that
the plants in the back row that were grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in the compost-dependent soil overall just
do the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tall, they're green, they look
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true across the board,
no matter which microbiome was
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the opposite end of the spectrum,
you have the plants in the front row,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were grown in the really highly
fertilized soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they're small,
and they're stunted, and they look yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are some leaves dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also true pretty much across
the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two soils in the middle of
the control in the lowly fertilized soil
[SPEAKER_00]: are intermediate between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really interesting here are
these pots in this rightmost column,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were pots where the high fertilized
microbiome was transplanted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in comparison to other
pots in the same row, those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow, and they're stunted, and they're
losing leaves, and they look not as great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this reflected in the biomass
data as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three columns correspond to those
three pots that I had circled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in comparison to other
bars in the same panel, so to other pots
[SPEAKER_00]: that were from the same soil type,
these pots have significantly lower
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass than the other plants,
within the same soil treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite an interesting result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap this all together, I found that
at the end of Generation IV, I had four
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when those were reciprocally
transplanted into new soils, only the
[SPEAKER_00]: highly fertilized microbiomes maintained
some of their community footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correspondingly, plants grown with that
microbiome had lower biomass, fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: nodules, lower percent nitrogen,
and they were yellow and stunted,
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison to other plants that were
grown in the same soil, just with other
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can conclude from this is that
really excessive or repeated inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus fertilization may be changing
the microbiome in such a way that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: less able to support plant growth,
particularly alfalfa growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's quite important in the
transition to sustainable agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it suggests that we will have to
do some reckless agglomeration work on our
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes before they're back to the
sort of nutrient cycling that we will need
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be at in order to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I have a lot of people to
thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three mentors, Jenny Carnifin,
Terry Bell, and Grant Thompson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks also to everyone on the Plant
Science Honors Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everyone in my lab who helped me
out with various pieces of the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly counting nodules,
because that took a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Cornell Farm Services for
providing me the soil and the compost to
[SPEAKER_00]: get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to several people who helped me
design the study and interpret my
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, to the two undergraduate
grants, which helped support this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
