[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Carrie Martin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Environmental Sustainability
Planner at the New Jersey Institute of
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology Technical Assistance to
Brownfield Communities Program,
[SPEAKER_03]: also known as NJIT TAB.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a primer of what I do,
NJIT TAB serves as a free, independent
[SPEAKER_03]: resource to state, territory, regional,
county, tribal, and local government
[SPEAKER_03]: entities, as well as nonprofits,
to learn about, identify, assess,
[SPEAKER_03]: clean up, and redevelop brownfields.
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently serve EPA regions two and
four, two being New York, New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands,
and four being the Southeastern United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, the Carolinas, Georgia,
Florida, Mississippi, Alabama,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tennessee, and Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make sure we're on the same page,
let's refer to the EPA definition of a
[SPEAKER_03]: brownfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a brownfield is defined as real
property, the expansion, redevelopment,
[SPEAKER_03]: or reuse of which may be complicated by
the presence or potential presence of
[SPEAKER_03]: hazardous substances, pollutants,
contaminants, controlled substances,
[SPEAKER_03]: petroleum, petroleum products,
as well as mine scarred land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important to point out that not
all contaminated properties are
[SPEAKER_03]: brownfields, and not all brownfields are
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, an active gas station
that experiences a leaking underground
[SPEAKER_03]: storage tank is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's not a brownfield because
it's an active property.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, a property that
contains a closed auto repair facility
[SPEAKER_03]: would be considered a brownfield because
it's a vacant facility that previously
[SPEAKER_03]: handled petroleum and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: If testing determines that the site
actually doesn't contain any
[SPEAKER_03]: contamination, it would still be
considered a brownfield by the EPA because
[SPEAKER_03]: the stigma or perception of potential
contamination is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brownfields are legacies of our industrial
past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brownfield sites can include things such
as former factories, warehouses,
[SPEAKER_03]: leatheries, tanneries, chemical processing
plants, manufactured gas plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: rails and freight yards, textile mills,
mines, foundries, as well as dumps and
[SPEAKER_03]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, there are non-industrial
brownfield sites and more modern land
[SPEAKER_03]: uses, such as closed gas stations,
auto repair shops, former pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: or medical facilities, metal scrapping,
vacant retail shopping centers,
[SPEAKER_03]: dry cleaners.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are smaller businesses that use and
handle chemicals, and buildings themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: may be considered brownfields due to the
materials used to create them,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as asbestos and lead paint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So legacy pollutants, such as those listed
in this table, were used in a variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: past land uses and can remain in the
environment long after they were
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some sources listed here,
but typically we see lead from lead-based
[SPEAKER_03]: paints or leaded gasoline, asbestos in
insulation and roofing, petroleum from
[SPEAKER_03]: fuel tanks and heating tanks, volatile
organic compounds from dry cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: solvents, petroleum products, pesticides,
and others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Identifying these contaminants happens
during the site assessment phase,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they're cleaned up during the
site remediation phase to acceptable
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of negative impacts of
brownfield sites outside of the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental exposure to contamination
can degrade soil, water, and air quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: and human exposure can cause public health
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But brownfields also contribute to
neighborhood deterioration and negative
[SPEAKER_03]: perceptions of a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can attract vandals, open dumping,
and other unwanted criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can lower property values,
reduce employment opportunities,
[SPEAKER_03]: and can lead to lost tax revenue and
limited economic growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to note that this isn't
only something that's felt, this is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's felt across communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So according to data from fiscal year 20
population data in the acre system,
[SPEAKER_03]: which the EPA uses to track brownfields
redevelopment in their programs,
[SPEAKER_03]: for those populations within a half mile
to a mile of a brownfield site,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're more likely to be low-income
communities, as well as having less than a
[SPEAKER_03]: high school education than the United
States as a whole, which puts them at a
[SPEAKER_03]: disadvantage for economic growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more likely to have economic
opportunity on top of the negative
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental effects of the brownfield
properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, that there are some advantages
of having brownfield sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many are located along waterways,
as well as rail lines, are located within
[SPEAKER_03]: central downtown areas, making their
locations advantageous for redevelopment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many have existing infrastructure,
such as utility and sewer lines on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also can hold historical as well
as architectural significance.
[SPEAKER_03]: These aspects also make former brownfields
advantageous locations for energy
[SPEAKER_03]: generation, as well as storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Siting energy generation and storage on
potentially contaminated lands can mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that the land was already previously
developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result, you can leverage existing
infrastructure on and servicing the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So further, it protects open sites and
space by not siting these facilities on
[SPEAKER_03]: previously undeveloped lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left-hand side of your screen,
you can see the Financial Center for the
[SPEAKER_03]: American Public University System,
which is the second largest online higher
[SPEAKER_03]: education provider in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: The site was formerly used for warehousing
and parking and is now home to a LEED
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver certified office and meeting space
for over 400 employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parking lot has 1,600 solar panels,
which makes it the largest solar array in
[SPEAKER_03]: the state of West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also has 14 vehicle charging sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: This array provides half the energy that's
needed for the Financial Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's located in the commercial corridor
along the line between Ransom and
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlestown, West Virginia, near the
Ransom Civic Center, meaning that
[SPEAKER_03]: residents and employees of both towns can
take advantage of the vehicle charging
[SPEAKER_03]: stations at a convenient location.
[SPEAKER_03]: The site also demonstrates how a state's
largest array need not be located on open
[SPEAKER_03]: space, but it can be located in a vibrant
downtown area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Siting energy facilities on Brownfields
may also have economic benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can provide economic activity on sites
that lack other reuse options.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the image on the right is from the
former Goodyear Industrial Campus in
[SPEAKER_03]: Windsor, Vermont.
[SPEAKER_03]: Limited long-term planning options were
available for this site because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: inside of a designated floodplain.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, the site was cleaned up,
electrical connections were raised above
[SPEAKER_03]: the floodplain, and it's now home to a
solar array.
[SPEAKER_03]: This 500 kilowatt solar array system is
all used locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see from these examples,
a Brownfield holds the potential for being
[SPEAKER_03]: transformed into a community asset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remediation and redevelopment of
Brownfields presents us with an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity for renewal in our community
as well as our energy sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's discuss an example of how remediated
Brownfield sites have been used for energy
[SPEAKER_03]: generation and their associated
co-benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Topology, which is a
community planning firm in Newark,
[SPEAKER_03]: New Jersey, the Elm Street Logistics
Center used to be 90 acres of contaminated
[SPEAKER_03]: land.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now been transformed into 1 million
square foot warehouse and distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: center for Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This redevelopment created jobs and it
added taxable improved property where
[SPEAKER_03]: there was none before.
[SPEAKER_03]: The positive environmental impacts of this
redevelopment include, first, that it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: remediated site and it simply improves the
environment by removing contaminants from
[SPEAKER_03]: the property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, we also have energy generation
power through solar panels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And third, we have some green
infrastructure that has been integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: into this property.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's bioretention basins as well as
porous pavement and rain gardens to handle
[SPEAKER_03]: stormwater surrounding the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to mention is when we're
seeing increasing storm events occurring,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you have increased precipitation,
you want to make sure on Brownfield sites
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're not mobilizing any potential
contamination on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really important to integrate
stormwater management surrounding the site
[SPEAKER_03]: so that when those major rain events do
occur, the water is handled offsite and it
[SPEAKER_03]: reduces the possibility of mobilizing
contamination via floodwaters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brownfield's redevelopment also has a lot
of social community co-benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this logistics center is found a block
away from Perth Amboy's downtown and
[SPEAKER_03]: Associated New Jersey Transit train
station, which makes it easy for everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: to access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Further, this redevelopment includes a
public walkway, a public amphitheater park
[SPEAKER_03]: for outdoor performances, as well as a
building to house the city's office of
[SPEAKER_03]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was once a source of potential
health and safety hazards and a community
[SPEAKER_03]: eyesore is now an opportunity for active
transportation, recreation, and arts and
[SPEAKER_03]: culture events.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll briefly go over the Brownfield
redevelopment process.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not linear, but in general,
you can see that a base of good planning
[SPEAKER_03]: informs the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Site assessments are completed,
which inform the remediation strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once the site is cleaned up,
it's ready for redevelopment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocky Mountain Institute will definitely
go into this in greater detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the sources of information on
energy generation on Brownfield sites is
[SPEAKER_03]: the Repowering America's Land Initiative,
which is still live.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still go to that website as of
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go to EPA.gov.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download their Brownfield's
renewable energy siting checklist.
[SPEAKER_03]: We anticipate that this fall, EPA
Brownfield grants will become available.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are multi-purpose and assessment
grants, which provide funding for
[SPEAKER_03]: activities like Brownfield inventories,
planning, environmental assessments,
[SPEAKER_03]: and community outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also revolving loan fund grants,
which provide governments funds to
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalize loans to clean up Brownfields.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are cleanup grants, which provide
funding to carry out cleanup activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are also job training grants,
which enable graduates to obtain full-time
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable employment in various aspects
of contaminant and petroleum product
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanup, including sustainable cleanup and
reuse, as well as chemical safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: As extension professionals, universities
can hold these job training grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know University of South Florida has
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Montclair State University here in New
Jersey also just recently got a job
[SPEAKER_03]: training grant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I have been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been Kerry Martin from NJIT Tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit about our services,
along with virtual webinars, such as what
[SPEAKER_03]: we provided today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can assist communities and nonprofits
virtually or in-person with community
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement, as well as educational forums,
from beginner-friendly Brownfield's basics
[SPEAKER_03]: to more hands-on technical events,
including panel sessions, community
[SPEAKER_03]: workshops, and Breaking Brownfields,
where we invite private sector
[SPEAKER_03]: representatives and experts to answer
project-specific questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also provide one-on-one technical
assistance and offer tailored guidance and
[SPEAKER_03]: answer questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: On what you need assistance with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find other webinars that we've
done at our Brownfields Academy at our
[SPEAKER_03]: website at njit.edu slash tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have how-to videos, infographics,
success stories, previously recorded
[SPEAKER_03]: webinars, news, and upcoming events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I leave you all today, I hope that
what I've discussed thus far has shown you
[SPEAKER_03]: that in communities all across this
country, no matter rural, urban,
[SPEAKER_03]: big, small, and especially in low-income
communities, you can work to explain the
[SPEAKER_03]: economic, environmental, and community
co-benefits that come with things like
[SPEAKER_03]: solar arrays and energy generation,
using solar arrays and other sources like
[SPEAKER_03]: that in these communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you all for your time today,
and I'll kick it over to Tansy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Tansy Massey-Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a senior associate at the Rocky
Mountain Institute, and I'm based in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I'm going to be speaking about
giving you an introduction of
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields, what we call those clean
energy on Brownfields, and talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: their opportunities for clean energy
reuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Brightfields Rocky Mountain Institute,
or RMI, is an independent, nonpartisan,
[SPEAKER_04]: nonprofit organization dedicated to
accelerating prosperous clean energy
[SPEAKER_04]: future for all.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were founded in 1982, and we combine
research, whole systems thinking,
[SPEAKER_04]: and unconventional partnerships to help
communities advance sustainable energy
[SPEAKER_04]: systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our office in Basalt, Colorado,
although we are now a global organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: RMI is a partner to the Technical
Assistance to Brownfields program.
[SPEAKER_04]: The map on the right is all the different
Technical Assistance to Brownfields
[SPEAKER_04]: program, including NJIT.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Kerry just went over, they provide a
whole range of services, and we are a
[SPEAKER_04]: partner that provides services
specifically related to clean energy
[SPEAKER_04]: reuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we partner with KSU and
C-CLEAR, so we provide communities in EPA
[SPEAKER_04]: regions five through 10 with free
technical assistance for clean energy
[SPEAKER_04]: reuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: We support communities and site owners
interested in responsibly planning for and
[SPEAKER_04]: deploying clean energy on Brownfields
enclosed landfills and addressing
[SPEAKER_04]: Brownfields related reuse and
revitalization challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: RMI helps communities across America
advance transformational Brightfield
[SPEAKER_04]: projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goals are to educate communities and
site owners about Brightfield reuse
[SPEAKER_04]: options that include clean energy,
to provide pre-development site evaluation
[SPEAKER_04]: and analysis to communities considering
Brightfields, and to provide other
[SPEAKER_04]: technical assistance and tools to help
with reuse planning, funding, financing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and clean energy procurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I'm going to talk about what
Brightfields are, the large potential
[SPEAKER_04]: market that they offer, community benefits
and challenges, and how to get started
[SPEAKER_04]: with our technical assistance if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to start things off, what are
Brightfields?
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields repurpose Brownfields with
renewable energy to support a more local
[SPEAKER_04]: and equitable energy transition.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Kerry just went over, a Brownfield is a
property where the expansion,
[SPEAKER_04]: redevelopment, or reuse may be complicated
by the presence or potential presence of a
[SPEAKER_04]: hazardous substance, pollutant,
or contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did just talk about all the
examples of Brownfields, so I won't get
[SPEAKER_04]: into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a Brightfields is when the
redevelopment is clean energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the clean energy is built on a former
Brownfield or Superfund site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not an official term.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a nice way to use that solar pun
there and call it a Brightfield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields come in all shapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have two solar projects on the
left and on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a wind project on a
Brownfields in the bottom picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Landfill solar, in particular,
can adapt to site-specific needs with
[SPEAKER_04]: purposeful design.
[SPEAKER_04]: All Brightfields can adapt to
site-specific needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here are some examples of landfill
solar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, we have these ballasted
structures that go on top of the landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that the solar structures do not
penetrate the cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all the wiring will be above
ground as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, again, the cap is not penetrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solar can also be built around any
monitoring infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, this is a methane monitoring
system that the solar is getting built
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the solar is also built around
this access road.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, solar can be adapted to fit the
needs of the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, a landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: But any type of solar can be adapted for
really any type of Brownfield project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most existing Brightfields use solar
power.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they can include other renewable
technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a breakdown of the number of
projects that are solar versus wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many more solar projects that are
installed in the United States compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when we look at the capacity,
which means the amount of power that is
[SPEAKER_04]: installed, the wind takes up a larger
proportion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, just 25 projects that are wind
projects are taking up about a third of
[SPEAKER_04]: the projects when we look at capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just because wind projects
generate much more electricity than solar
[SPEAKER_04]: projects compared to the amount of land
that they take up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields are becoming part of the
clean energy transition across America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are a couple of examples of different
Brightfields projects in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Phoenix, Arizona, there's a 10 megawatt
project on 118 acres of a city of Phoenix
[SPEAKER_04]: landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Pittsburgh, there's a two megawatt
of solar installed on an old steel mill.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Martin County, Kentucky, we have 200
megawatts of solar planned on a shuttered
[SPEAKER_04]: Martiki mine land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, in Franklin County,
Ohio, there's five megawatts, sorry,
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 megawatts of solar planned on a closed
landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just four of the over 600
different projects that are already
[SPEAKER_04]: installed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Landfill solar has been and can be built
safely and responsibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly has been done before.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are at least 338 clean energy
projects built on closed landfills,
[SPEAKER_04]: according to the EPA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the right, this is a breakdown of
all the different types of projects,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the different types of Brightfields
projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it safe to build on a closed landfill?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: An energy developer should be required to
take precautions to not damage the
[SPEAKER_04]: existing landfill cap and other
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And procurement processes can specifically
request qualified developers who
[SPEAKER_04]: understand the challenges of building
solar on a closed landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just add one more point to this,
that developers can be asked specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: to really make sure any of the
requirements are met.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we're working with a
community right now who's concerned about
[SPEAKER_04]: the regular monitoring requirements for
their closed landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just going to communicate that
to the developer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the developer will ensure that there's
still the ability for the landfill manager
[SPEAKER_04]: to go in and do their regular monitoring
once the solar has been installed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And developers, there are several
developers across the country that have
[SPEAKER_04]: experience building on landfills and
brownfields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to talk about the large
potential market that Brightfields offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a large but mostly untapped
potential market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the left, this is a map of the
Brightfields projects that are installed
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see a lot of those solar projects
across the country in yellow with some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those wind projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Popping up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This map is the completed projects,
but there's actually over 190,000
[SPEAKER_04]: potential brownfield sites that would be
viable for clean energy deployment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is from that EPA repowering site
that Kerry referred to before.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we just looked at the landfill
potential, so this is just the closed
[SPEAKER_04]: landfills in the country, this could yield
a project with approximately 63 gigawatts
[SPEAKER_04]: of power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to put that into perspective,
I actually don't know this fact off the
[SPEAKER_04]: top of my head, but one household uses
something like a couple hundred kilowatts,
[SPEAKER_04]: unless someone else's on the line can say
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is quite a large scale that we're
working with, 63 gigawatts if we were just
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at landfills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only that 624 completed
Brightfields, which is 2.5 gigawatts of
[SPEAKER_04]: power today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just 1% of potential Brightfields could
support about six gigawatts of clean
[SPEAKER_04]: energy and 60,000 local jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really quite a big potential market
that we are looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also federal tax credits and
incentives that can increase the
[SPEAKER_04]: attractiveness for clean energy reuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have an asterisk here because as we
know, these federal tax credits are
[SPEAKER_04]: uncertain in the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will go over them just so everyone
on the call knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tax credits are available for renewable
energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are site agnostic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the right, this is what those clean
energy tax credits look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a 30% base tax credit for any
solar wind project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's additional adders if the
project uses domestic content,
[SPEAKER_04]: so materials made in the United States,
if the site is installed in an energy
[SPEAKER_04]: community, and if the project benefits low
income households or if the project is
[SPEAKER_04]: located in a low income household.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these new incentives are available to
support specifically Brightfield
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that energy community bonus right here
that I have circled, that's reserved for
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfield projects and for other
projects that are located in areas that
[SPEAKER_04]: have been affected by fossil fuel plants
closing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, these federal tax credits
still exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope they will still exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, there's a really big
incentive for installing clean energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to summarize, the opportunity
exists to repurpose thousands of sites and
[SPEAKER_04]: transform communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are hundreds of thousands of
brownfields available.
[SPEAKER_04]: The technical potential of Brightfields is
significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, the new and enhanced federal
incentives are there to advance
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to move on to community
benefits and challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Communities can leverage Brightfields to
deliver a wide range of local benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, they restore blighted lands.
[SPEAKER_04]: They attract local investment,
create local jobs, enhance environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: justice, support public health,
and generate positive press for the
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields help address past and present
environmental injustice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many brownfields are in or adjacent to
historically neglected and majority
[SPEAKER_04]: non-white populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Developing Brightfields can be part of the
solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an example in Washington,
DC.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ox Run Solar Farm is a 2.65 megawatt
array constructed with local contractors
[SPEAKER_04]: on a site contaminated by years of gas
station residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The project provides low cost power to
about 780 qualifying residents,
[SPEAKER_04]: where 86% of the households are black and
20% are below the poverty line.
[SPEAKER_04]: The project lowers electricity bills 50%
on average for subscribers estimated at
[SPEAKER_04]: about $500 per year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the project restored native ecology,
including pollinator habitats and native
[SPEAKER_04]: plant landscaping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Closed landfills are particularly
promising sites for hosting solar energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have conducive site conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: As landfills typically have good sun
exposure and other characteristics that
[SPEAKER_04]: support solar energy installation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are limited reuse options.
[SPEAKER_04]: So closed landfills don't really have
competing redevelopment options.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it avoids land use conflicts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Environmental justice, landfill solar
offers a sustainable non-hazardous reuse
[SPEAKER_04]: of sites that were often prior areas of
environmental injustice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a potential for scale as there
are tens of thousands of active landfills
[SPEAKER_04]: in the US and many thousands more that are
already closed and inactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields can also create local jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an example in Houston, Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The world's largest landfill solar farm is
planned for and permitted in a low income
[SPEAKER_04]: historically marginalized sunny side
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the 52 megawatt project on a 280
acre closed landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expected to power about 12,000 homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the project includes a solar training
program aimed at bolstering a local and
[SPEAKER_04]: regional workforce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brightfields are certainly not without
their complications.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the assessment and cleanup costs
associated with creating a brightfields.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's federal state and local
regulations, the permanent zoning land use
[SPEAKER_04]: and environmental reviews, add complexity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the site remediation timeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's remediation that needs to be
completed before a project construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the liability concerns between
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to have clarity on the
liability before you go into procurement
[SPEAKER_04]: to find a developer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, gridding interconnection
costs and timelines can vary substantially
[SPEAKER_04]: between projects due to the existing
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has the potential to seriously
drive up costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Landfill solar may face various additional
challenges and complications.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the cap consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caps need to be closed and you need to
make sure the technology does not
[SPEAKER_04]: penetrate the cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's settlement concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to make sure there's not high
rates of settlement before installing
[SPEAKER_04]: solar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Existing infrastructure and operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll need the solar panels to
accommodate any onsite infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really not much electricity demand
for landfills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there may be some more utility
coordination required to find someone to
[SPEAKER_04]: buy the power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there could be community
concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Projects need to consider potential
long-standing environmental justice and
[SPEAKER_04]: site reuse concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interdepartmental coordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that happens on landfills and solar
is not going to fit nicely into one
[SPEAKER_04]: department's purview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I'll go quickly through our
technical assistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, we are a partner with the TAB
network for EPA regions five through 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this technical assistance is free for
communities in those areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The technical assistance that's available,
we help with identifying your most
[SPEAKER_04]: promising bright fields opportunity,
funding and financing guidance,
[SPEAKER_04]: and accelerating bright field procurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We offer insights from the bright field
market to support the procurement process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, if you're interested in
learning more or receiving technical
[SPEAKER_04]: assistance for a bright field project,
here's my contact information and our
[SPEAKER_04]: website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just add one last thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned we provide the TA for
communities in regions five through 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we are beginning to work,
we're accepting applications for
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental justice specific projects
that are located across the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone who's not located in regions
five through 10 is interested in getting
[SPEAKER_04]: some technical assistance for revitalizing
a site for clean energy reuse,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it specifically supports environmental
justice, we have a new technical
[SPEAKER_04]: assistance program for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please email me if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'll stop sharing my screen
and pass it back to Jennifer, or maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Vincent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just tell us quickly,
geographically, what are regions five
[SPEAKER_06]: through 10?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just get back this map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So five through 10 is going to be the
Midwest and over, just looking at this map
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just before you leave it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So Carrie, you are doing regions two and
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
Four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an older graphic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but all we're missing is the Northeast
and the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regions one is New England, and region
three is the Mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So New England is covered by Yukon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Mid-Atlantic is three,
which is covered by West Virginia
[SPEAKER_03]: University.
[SPEAKER_03]: New England states, Maine, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vermont, New Hampshire, and then
Mid-Atlantic being Delaware, Maryland,
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're covering region four,
Carrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, it's not important.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most everybody who will be on this call
should be in one of your two regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if not, you could help them find the
person in their appropriate region,
[SPEAKER_06]: correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and just one more quick question before
we leave the Brightfields component of
[SPEAKER_06]: this talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the zillion locations that you
identified, Tansy, forgive me for not
[SPEAKER_06]: remembering was 190,000 browns in the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there regions where there have we has
someone mapped the spots that are most
[SPEAKER_06]: productive for solar and what regions are
those?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that in other words, if our audience is
in New Hampshire and there's like zero
[SPEAKER_06]: relevant sites, then this is not so
appropriate for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are there some states that have huge
opportunity just because they happen to
[SPEAKER_06]: have an unfortunate number of brownfields?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send the link in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Repower.
[SPEAKER_04]: EPA does has a map that maps out all of
the sites that I was just referring to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you can see which areas are a
little bit more dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Minnesota and Wisconsin have
quite a few, but they're all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say every state should be
interested in the Brightfields
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we work with communities in the
northern part of the country that maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not going to have, you know,
solar isn't going to be quite as
[SPEAKER_04]: productive there as maybe it will in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: But states like Michigan and Washington
and Massachusetts are all really invested
[SPEAKER_04]: in solar and they're going to be deploying
solar at the same rate that other states
[SPEAKER_04]: will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pivot us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about how we deal with
formerly productive areas and make
[SPEAKER_00]: productive use of them, what we can do to
take advantage of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be remiss if I didn't say that
these are really important programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes down to trying to find
customers or off-takers for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have significant challenges,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got large solar capacity and
you've got utilities that don't want to or
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to buy it because they have
their own existing resources or you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a framework to meet with customers
and see what they need and how that can
[SPEAKER_00]: meet their demands, it can become a kind
of frustrating experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you guys a little
bit about Solar for All, which is another
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA program that has avoided, well,
had a little hiccup and has avoided most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, let's call it uncertainty that
existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funds seem to be flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who I've talked to on these
programs in different states has been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw down their formerly unresponsive
EPA representatives have started
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to emails and setting up
meetings again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like we are on a productive
and hopefully sustainable path.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to Solar for All.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick note about where I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for the North Carolina Clean Energy
Technology Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a public service center that was
chartered by the UNC system in the 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: originally as the North Carolina Solar
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do mostly sustainable energy economy
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide objective simulations,
data, our claim to fame is the Desire USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the database of state incentives for
renewables and energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really advocate for anything
other than just kind of broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we host an energy conference and have
partnerships with the Smart Electric Power
[SPEAKER_00]: Association and the Solar Energy
Industries Association, along with several
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about Solar for All,
in most states, there were coalitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were kind of, let's call it
monoliths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Energize NC, which is what the North
Carolina Solar for All program is called,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a partnership between my center,
the Clean Energy Fund, which is North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina's green bank, Advanced Energy,
which is a kind of utilities services and
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting company that does mostly
nonprofit work and the North Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Environmental Quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DQ is our prime on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are the applicant and we are
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar for All requires us to touch rural
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires us to touch disadvantaged
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these communities have been underserved
chronically for decades, perhaps even
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the goal of the program is to
deliver them a 20% savings on their
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to come over, we've got to kind
of get over a lot of hurdles when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to find the people, we've got to
talk with the people, we've got to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: people's trust and then actually provide
them something for a meaningful amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen, I don't know how many of
you have been in the industry for long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time, but in the early 2000s,
there was kind of a bubble around solar
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal technologies and solar thermal
technologies got really heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: incentivized and that ended up with a lot
of fly-by-night operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a find the people protect the
people, provide the services kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got really long program
objectives, but these are the important
[SPEAKER_00]: parts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're delivering benefits to
communities, low-income communities and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged prioritized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the funds are enabling them to
benefit from some type of zero emission
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had a situation like New Jersey,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they have adders where you can add,
you get additional incentives for
[SPEAKER_00]: developing on brownfields, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be monetary incentives,
some localities do expedited permitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually makes it cheaper to offer
these, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking within the confines of
North Carolina, because this is North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina's solar for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that kind of benefit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at some brownfield
development, some greenfield development,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's kind of, we're in the planning
year right now, a lot of rooftop solar,
[SPEAKER_00]: some community solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at our goals,
again, lots of words, the important words
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vincent, can you tell people briefly what
community solar is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that you were in an apartment
or a house with beautiful, well-shaded
[SPEAKER_00]: trees or something like that, or you were
a renter, didn't have access to a roof on
[SPEAKER_00]: which to put a 4KW, 6KW array,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of getting solar on your roof,
because you don't own it or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't wanna cut down your trees,
you would find either your local utility
[SPEAKER_00]: or perhaps even a subscriber organization
with some description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in different flavors in different
states and regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could then subscribe to solar
output that would be credited against your
[SPEAKER_00]: bill as though those panels were on your
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have several cooperatives in North
Carolina that offer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically buy a per panel
subscription, you pay a fee per month,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get credited that amount of
generation on your electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is a cost premium program
where a subscription costs more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: savings it delivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other cases, it's a breakeven or
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the context of Solar for All,
because we have to deliver a benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are looking at community solar
programs, again, kind of limited to North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, that either are cost beneficial
or we will buy down that subscription cost
[SPEAKER_00]: to deliver those benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the center writ large has
worked on community solar for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: over a decade in various capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked on community solar in the
Southeast in several different ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with industrial tenants or
industrial sites to provide what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: an anchor tenant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would develop community solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would develop a solar array,
take some of that energy and offer low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost subscriptions to folks who live
nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an interesting model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly it is just a way of getting
access to solar without having to have it
[SPEAKER_00]: on your property or not having to own the
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're big proponents of it where it's
practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the confines of Energize NC and
also our previous community solar
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions, we're trying to get input
from the folks who would use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get community input,
we want to get residents input,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to be representative in who we're
getting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some communities that are
really, really like philanthropically
[SPEAKER_00]: enabled and they are kind of activated,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very quick to respond and
they're very robust partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to make sure that folks that
have not historically been selected or
[SPEAKER_00]: have not self-selected actually get some
input on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to go through our tribal
communities, our state recognized,
[SPEAKER_00]: our federally recognized tribes for all of
the regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a hundred counties in North
Carolina who are trying to touch the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of them that are not almost
exclusively above the federal poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about community engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this in a lot of ways in the center,
backwards, now we go forwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually going to go out of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off in mid 2023 starting to
reach out to communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a market development
workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does market development mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it means that, well, we don't have a
rooftop solar industry that's very robust
[SPEAKER_00]: in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a community solar industry
that's very robust in North Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: because the incentives just aren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at it and we had folks from
South Carolina, Virginia, from Tennessee
[SPEAKER_00]: come and like consult on us and then tell
us what they're doing, what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some really interesting
conversations with folks from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reached out to utilities and said,
all right, what's your problem with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what do you like about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just our goal was engagement at all
levels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got state government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got utilities in on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got program listening sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got strategy sessions, and then
we're doing outreach and coordination
[SPEAKER_00]: based on topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our overall program launch timeline is
late 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will launch our full solar for all
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had almost a full year of
planning period at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are shaping what the single family
incentives will be, if there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: market rate loans available and what
community solar will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is screaming up at us quick,
fast, then a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna talk a little bit about the
outreach that we did, hopefully to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some leads lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be too long over this,
but we start again with kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest players in the bulk power sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with the IOUs, Duke, and we have
two flavors of Duke Energy in North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have slightly different approaches,
slightly different tariffs, slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different rate structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we engaged them on both fronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Dominion Energy operates a little
bit in Northeastern North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our only market access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a little bit of access to PJM if
we develop projects in Northeastern North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also worked with electric cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are not familiar with
the way utilities kind of break down,
[SPEAKER_00]: investor owned utilities are just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're owned by investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're large, publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric cooperatives are member owned
organizations that were enabled by the
[SPEAKER_00]: rural electrification act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have member owners and tend to be
smaller in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are largely distribution utilities,
meaning they don't own a lot of their own
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases are actually prohibited
or limited in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-generation and energy efficiency they
can deploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have municipal power
authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when a city owns deployment
infrastructure and a power plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say and or power plant because
of the hundred and some odd, hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: four maybe municipal power authorities we
have in North Carolina, only half a dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: or so have any significant form of
generation over a megawatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked with all of these folks and
we're currently in conversations with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, these conversations
take a while when there are 26
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperatives, 100 power authorities and
two utilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a lot of talking about where are
your underserved customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are your reliability issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else could we deliver non-monetary
benefits to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to shape, we look at the
geography that is informed by income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talk with the utilities that
serve those geographies to kind of further
[SPEAKER_00]: hone down where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we engage with local governments and
local governments are wonderful places,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are chronically understaffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have probably worked with
local governments and there's like five
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing the work of two dozen and
they do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually leaned on councils of
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in North Carolina, there are several
councils of government in South Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: as well that kind of aggregate some
multi-county services and provide us with
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts and provide us with, you know,
kind of facilitate interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond going to just the county,
just the locality, just the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: community or city or town, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk with the council of
government, we would talk with the county
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk with the league
municipalities to say, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people don't have the bandwidth for
it, but they really need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you provide some of this information
on their behalf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us some folks that are into
this on their behalf?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talk with housing finance because
multifamily is a big challenge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: solar space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, community solar is its own beast
and you can provide a lot of solar access
[SPEAKER_00]: to multifamily dwellings by assigning
individual subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would it look like if an
apartment complex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a parking lot with a southern exposure
that you could then put panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talked with very heavily with
community organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community organizations are the folks
that are in the communities on a
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day basis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are folks that have been
there for weatherization assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, have been there for food drives
and new infrastructure, various civic
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these we've kind of locked in on as our
real advantage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you come in and say,
hey, I am from your state capital and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are hours away in a locality that has
chronically been underserved, you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: credit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no reason to trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can provide them with all of the
beautiful presentations that you want and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk as fast as I need to,
but they still won't trust me,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we make this case to interfaith
power and light, sadly, the national
[SPEAKER_00]: interfaith power and light seems to have
folded, but North Carolina's interfaith
[SPEAKER_00]: power and light is still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: The council of churches, the legal
conservation poters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked with these people and they're
connecting us directly with the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that need the most support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to work with folks that we
have existing relationships with,
[SPEAKER_00]: former relationships with and make new
connections where needed is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's narrowing down where you want to
focus and then trying to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cut this now and just say,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really exciting, trying to
figure out how to provide services to
[SPEAKER_00]: chronically underserved communities and
trying to put two useful or productive
[SPEAKER_00]: use, formerly used lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tansy, I'm going to ask you a little bit
of an unfair question at just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked on solar decommissioning with
some of my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced a solar decommissioning report
and that led us to the Energy and Mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: Law Foundation and they have a huge,
how can we put solar on reclaimed mine
[SPEAKER_00]: lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that, I don't know if
you, RMI has ever worked with those or
[SPEAKER_00]: EMLF, but if not, I think that's worth
discussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I say, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do some work with reclaimed mine
lands.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't worked directly with any
communities that want to do that quite
[SPEAKER_04]: yet, but we have some in the works that
might happen soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had our intern doing research on
that specifically last summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should chat for a couple reasons,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: David, do you have questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, I always have questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, you know, I think these,
by the way, I work on a lot on different
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects of the solar siting questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my question comes a little bit out
of that, which is, and I work more on
[SPEAKER_05]: large scale and I'm in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, one of the things that I
just wonder if you each have perspectives
[SPEAKER_05]: on, you know, to decarbonize, we're trying
to locate a lot of new distributed and
[SPEAKER_05]: large scale electricity on places.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you kind of think about this,
do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put it in one way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think about it more from kind of a
community development perspective when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're interacting with the landowners and
the people, or do you think about it more
[SPEAKER_05]: from the perspective?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be like on Brightfields and
Brownfields, like, hey, this is a,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a problem in the community and we
need to solve the problem that's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you think it more from a perspective
of we're in the middle of an energy
[SPEAKER_05]: transition that where we need as much sort
of clean energy as we can get and this is
[SPEAKER_05]: an opportunity that, or is it really an
equal mix of both of those or something
[SPEAKER_05]: else that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, do you want to take a first stab at
Iking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what I tried to model in my
presentation and something I really
[SPEAKER_03]: strongly believe is that things like solar
energy in particular have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: co-benefits to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I, you know, explained, you can have
solar arrays on, you know, warehouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have community solar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can integrate like solar into these
large warehouse and distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well, I come from more of a hazard
mitigation background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I like to stress the fact that a
lot of places have above ground utilities
[SPEAKER_03]: and during natural disasters, those can
get damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like experienced Sandy here and
Hurricane Sandy here in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we were out of power from many,
many days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks have generators,
some don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, distributed energy through
things like micro grids is a way to add
[SPEAKER_03]: redundancy to the grid and to make it so,
[SPEAKER_03]: to mitigate the amount of time that power
is down during those disaster events.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ways to discuss the ample
benefits environmentally and economically
[SPEAKER_03]: and resilience wise of solar that need not
even touch on decarbonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will say that we're involved in a
DOE eraser project looking at community
[SPEAKER_00]: micro grids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So solar storage, even diesel backup to
meet community needs, kind of maximizing
[SPEAKER_00]: existing community access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And can I ask a follow up question,
which has to do with storage?
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't talk so much about storage
today, but since these sites, at least the
[SPEAKER_06]: Brownfield sites, but I suppose also when
we're thinking about homeowners and
[SPEAKER_06]: rooftop solar, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: These ways in which we can start
integrating in our solar or renewable
[SPEAKER_06]: energy project storage so that we're
enhancing the strength of the grid and
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not dumping any of the surplus
energy that's happening at a moment that
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't being able to be used.
[SPEAKER_06]: So could any of you speak to your
complimentary like storage with renewable
[SPEAKER_06]: energy capture agendas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll just say we always look for
opportunities for storage if it can be
[SPEAKER_04]: co-located with solar or wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly makes the project,
well, depending on the community,
[SPEAKER_04]: if there is a grid, the grid is already
maxed out and they need a battery so that
[SPEAKER_04]: they, can still build the solar without
losing the power that they generate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a really good example of
when a battery is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked with a community in Wyoming who
wanted to hook up to an existing
[SPEAKER_04]: substation that was already connected to
wind and they wanted to connect solar
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would have a hybrid connection,
but so that you don't lose the power from
[SPEAKER_04]: the solar while the wind is blowing,
you know, the wind is blowing and the sun
[SPEAKER_04]: is shining at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really good time to install a
battery.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big thing is that it drives up costs
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Batteries are expensive, but if you can
afford it, it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially from the household
perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of smaller utilities
throughout the Southeast and some even
[SPEAKER_00]: like various cooperatives have non-export
or zero export tariffs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot export to the grid at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to feasibly site solar
would be to either severely undersize your
[SPEAKER_00]: array so that you're only meeting that
kind of peak load, or you can size it to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet household consumption, approximately,
and then have a battery to kind of provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some opportunities to actually use that
power meaningfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as a side note, we're up at time,
but if anybody has suggestions on speakers
[SPEAKER_06]: on different kinds of storage and the
benefits and the issues with installing
[SPEAKER_06]: different kinds of storage systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are risks associated with
them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please send them back channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one last question from Kristoff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in West Michigan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our utility creates many interconnection
barriers that make community owned
[SPEAKER_06]: community solar impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking for ways around this while
still providing options for the community
[SPEAKER_06]: to own the array.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Kristoff, I think there's lots of
problems like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any comments from this panel before we
close up for today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before we hopped on, Vincent and I
were talking about community solar issues,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're working in Michigan quite
heavily with the state and with
[SPEAKER_04]: communities there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Kristoff, if it's not brightfield
related, we can point you in the right
[SPEAKER_04]: direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it is brightfield related,
we should definitely talk about your work
[SPEAKER_04]: in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that there is a direct
workaround that is financial rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a ERPA compliant,
a qualifying facility in consumer's
[SPEAKER_00]: territory that they have to offer a
standard offer to, and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: community that owns that, they can then
distribute all revenue from that energy
[SPEAKER_00]: injection back to its owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's typically called a community
benefits LLC construct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: A community benefits LLC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should have a webinar on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of novel strategies to get
over and around interconnection concerns.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this has been a fantastic panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom
and your experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And please look if you're interested on
our YouTube channel for this and other
[SPEAKER_06]: recordings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our next webinar, I believe,
is April 16th, forgive me, at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eastern Standard Time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be on one earth and climate
topics, thinking holistically about all
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of things from microbes to animal
agriculture to human health as a way of
[SPEAKER_06]: looking forward on climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again to all of our speakers and to
all of our attendees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you all have a good rest of your
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for setting this up, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
