[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't spoken to the seminar series
before so it's really nice to be here and
[SPEAKER_04]: see familiar faces and introduce you to
our program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I want to cover quite a large
number of things so Matt's gonna give me
[SPEAKER_04]: the high five if I'm going too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to set the stage in case you're
not familiar with global data on where we
[SPEAKER_04]: are with climate change and how that
affects agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to introduce you to the
work we've been doing since 2015 with the
[SPEAKER_04]: climate smart farming program and that
includes stakeholder research and
[SPEAKER_04]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am trained as a social scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: My PhD is in global environmental politics
which you could ask me how I got to this
[SPEAKER_04]: position.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a long circuitous route but I'm
really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love working with farmers and
agriculture at the intersection of
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture and environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll talk about our resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll introduce you to the decision tools
that we have developed and talk about the
[SPEAKER_04]: outreach that we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to take this to sort of
connect it to the work that Johannes and I
[SPEAKER_04]: do by talking about what we do at the COP
and how climate smart agriculture is a
[SPEAKER_04]: term that's really gaining traction
globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's critically important that Cornell
stay involved with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to acknowledge that I'm
part of a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see the team up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this work I'm presenting it but it's
really that I help facilitate a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: work that goes on at Cornell and this is
not just my output.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole team.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Brian Belcher is one of our
programmers, an amazing computer
[SPEAKER_04]: programmer with a master's degree in
atmospheric science and he was going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: here today to help talk about the tools
but he is sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to give you a little bit of background,
if you haven't seen this data,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the global temperature change data
showing here global change in Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_04]: from before 1900 up past 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you saw the New York Times article
recently, last year was one of the warmest
[SPEAKER_04]: years on record.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Earth's temperature globally in 2018
was more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_04]: warmer or above average temperature since
the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we talk about it in terms of
climate change because it's not only
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature change but impacts like
increasing severity of drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this shows data of the change in the
drought severity index, the Palmer drought
[SPEAKER_04]: severity index from 1900 to 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: Areas of the globe that are more dry are
getting drier and projections are that
[SPEAKER_04]: that will be the trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we in the Northeast are actually very
fortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the things that when I go
out and do very frequent talks with
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture groups, farmers, this is the
thing that they are noticing the most and
[SPEAKER_04]: that I talk about in terms of they often
don't make the connection that this is
[SPEAKER_04]: related to changing climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see an observed trend in these very,
very heavy rainfall events from 1950 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 2002, 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is happening all over the United
States but the most pronounced effect is
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Northeastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're getting these very heavy
downpours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this shows you data from the last
National Climate Assessment that shows
[SPEAKER_04]: that in the Northeast we're seeing this
frost-free season length lengthening by 10
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these changes all affect farmers and
where we are projected to go, this
[SPEAKER_04]: projections of climate depend on the
emissions that we all emit globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is just a middle emission
scenario, there is a high emission
[SPEAKER_04]: scenario and a very, very efficient low
emission scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with a high emission scenario or a
middle emission scenario, we are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: On average, we are expected to increase by
two to 13 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the century, depending on what we as
humans do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is really one of the most
critical issues globally that we face and
[SPEAKER_04]: especially for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So agriculture, you can think about it
that it's really one of the most unique
[SPEAKER_04]: sectors and one of the most challenging to
address.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why when I talk about global
policy, it's been very hard to address
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture within the United Nations
Framework Convention because it's so
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's an economic sector,
farmers need to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are also globally one of the
largest producers of greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_04]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is global data from the IPCC that
agriculture, forestry and land use
[SPEAKER_04]: represents 24% of global greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, they are one of the
most vulnerable sectors that is really
[SPEAKER_04]: impacted by climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a brand new FAO report from
2018 that shows the increase in these
[SPEAKER_04]: annual economic damages to agriculture
from climate related disasters.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that one disaster or one weather
event is not climate change, but we know
[SPEAKER_04]: that these extreme events are increasing
with climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from 14 billion in the last decade,
we've gone to $100 billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another way of thinking about this is
in our own region, we know farmers are
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing challenges and are expected
to experience these challenges in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future, including the increase in extreme
weather events, flooding, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: short-term drought on the other extreme,
high temperature stress, new pests and
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of all, you saw that picture of the
globe of where it's going to get more dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we think about Dr. Toby Alt's work,
looking at projections for very long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: droughts in the Southeastern United
States, then if we think about where we
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the Northeast, we have
opportunities potentially if we manage our
[SPEAKER_04]: water resources well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also closely linked to 22% of the
population in markets in New York and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could be producing more products to
make up for losses in other areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is the latest national climate
assessment that just came out,
[SPEAKER_04]: even in the Trump administration this came
out, talking about the effects on
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won't read it, but you can go and
find the link there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that as a background, the Cornell
Institute for Climate Smart Solutions was
[SPEAKER_04]: formed in 2013 really to focus on
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did change our name to be able to work
on communities very related to
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are based, we're working on
facilitating research, helping pull
[SPEAKER_04]: together large grant proposals that get
submitted to USDA or NSF.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a really huge capacity here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we think about it, there are more
than 150 researchers at Cornell working on
[SPEAKER_04]: some aspect related to climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of all the global universities,
I think we are one of the strongest in
[SPEAKER_04]: this area, and we should seize this
strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our core team here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sit over in Rice Hall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our faculty advisors are here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have three postdocs.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, Danielle is full time with us,
and then Carlos and Dimitri sit mostly in
[SPEAKER_04]: EIS and work with Toby, but they work on
tools that are on the climate smart
[SPEAKER_04]: farming website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then quite uniquely, I was on the
phone with our extension team this
[SPEAKER_04]: morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are an incredible resource for New
York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the only climate smart farming
team in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are folks that are out working
in the regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitty has a PhD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elizabeth is brand new to the team,
an amazing resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can really connect us to what's
happening on the farms and what farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are they gonna be using these tools?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what's the most important tool that we
could develop?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll talk about some of the resources
we've worked on with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mentioned at the beginning that I am
a social scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of the research that I do with
others here to contribute to the climate
[SPEAKER_04]: smart farming program is to take a look at
what stakeholders, in this case farmers or
[SPEAKER_04]: extension or consultants, think about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they doing to adapt?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they doing to mitigate?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the barriers that they
experience?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that a stakeholder is defined
as any citizen or group potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: affected by or having a vested interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think this is really critically
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love working at Cornell because we have
the capacity to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: interdisciplinary teams, probably more
than any other university.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I talk to my colleagues at American
University and they understand what we can
[SPEAKER_04]: do here, that I get to work with Matt on a
proposal or call him up and ask him for
[SPEAKER_04]: input, but I can work on the social
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's critically important because if
we're just developing fact sheets and
[SPEAKER_04]: tools, but we don't know if farmers even
want them or what their level of computer
[SPEAKER_04]: usage is, or are they gonna use them?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not likely to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have some data, a little bit
depressing data that shows that quite
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the things that, the idea here is that
we would be doing, we are doing cutting
[SPEAKER_04]: edge climate change research here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are developing decision tools for a
long time, starting and work in this
[SPEAKER_04]: department for the DAPTAN and other tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have very strong extension
programming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can engage farmers and
understand what they are looking for and
[SPEAKER_04]: then improve the research and the
extension that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the social science research
that we've been involved with,
[SPEAKER_04]: we did a meta analysis that looked at all
the literature on climate change and
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture from 1997 to 2016 and
published that in this article in Wires
[SPEAKER_04]: Climate Change.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've conducted focus groups in New York
and Pennsylvania that's been published.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are working on a publication
that looks at dairy producers use and
[SPEAKER_04]: actions in Wisconsin and New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was part of the Dairy Cap Project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've started to do some work in
surveys now that we have really some
[SPEAKER_04]: in-depth knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do more broad scale surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done a convenience sample survey
at Empire Farm Days over two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done an online random sample survey
of New York farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not get a great response rate
because it was an electronic survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think about 32,000 farmers in
New York State, we did not get a good
[SPEAKER_04]: response rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's in part because farmers are
less likely to fill out an electronic
[SPEAKER_04]: survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're planning to revise the survey and
do a mailed survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more expensive to do it that
way, but we're going to hire a company to
[SPEAKER_04]: help with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as an example, we can do farm
visits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with an intern that we had,
a cooperative extension climate smart
[SPEAKER_04]: farming intern, awesome undergraduate
Tyler Brewer, went out and he worked in
[SPEAKER_04]: Madison County all last summer with Sarah
Ficken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went out to over 30 farms and
talked about the impacts that farmers are
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing and what are the adaptation
practices they are working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just some general, too much text on
this slide, but some general findings from
[SPEAKER_04]: our social science aspects are that the
key impacts in the Northeast are things
[SPEAKER_04]: that we would expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: More farmers are noticing more extreme
weather, flooding are the two things they
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about most, changes in seasons and
pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that the majority of farmers
believe the climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even today, talking to our extension
team, they know that their colleagues are
[SPEAKER_04]: reluctant to talk to farmers about this
issue, but we know that farmers agree the
[SPEAKER_04]: climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I keep trying to talk to our extension
team and extension to say, don't be afraid
[SPEAKER_04]: to address this issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about it in terms of increased
flooding or talk about it in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: resiliency or energy savings through
mitigation, because they know that climate
[SPEAKER_04]: is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't shy away from this science based
topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from the focus groups,
we know that although farmers are
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned about climate impacts,
especially in New York state, when we've
[SPEAKER_04]: done the focus groups, they're also much
more concerned about these other issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we see is that climate change
just adds one more layer of stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think about the dairy industry and
profitability right now, climate change is
[SPEAKER_04]: not their top priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they get hit by a five inch
rainfall event, then yeah, they are
[SPEAKER_04]: suffering more than they would have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can talk to them about adaptation
practices that they're already doing or
[SPEAKER_04]: they could do slowly over time,
that's a good way of framing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just some very recent findings from
our pilot surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of climate change, 68% of the
farmers that responded were concerned or
[SPEAKER_04]: very concerned about drought and about
increases in extreme precipitation,
[SPEAKER_04]: 64%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the adaptation practices that they said
they are adopting, many are using
[SPEAKER_04]: diversified rotations, soil health,
less so reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we ask about tools or weather
forecasts, most farmers, 63%, do not use
[SPEAKER_04]: any apps or smartphones or mobile devices
to inform their management decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty depressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we asked about the specific online
weather and climate resources they are
[SPEAKER_04]: using, the farmer's almanac.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is not that accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a lot of work to do to get
farmers to really understand these tools
[SPEAKER_04]: and understand how they are helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'll introduce you to the
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have materials in the back,
some fact sheets and business cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take a bunch and hand them out
if you work with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really we're providing one place for
resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some videos of farmers talking
about what they've experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have links to our extension team.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the site actually got above 3000 web
hits a month recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see that the usage is climbing,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an example of a video that we
captured with the help of undergrads is
[SPEAKER_04]: this local farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you know him, Tor Aschner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says in the video, a normal season
doesn't seem like it happens anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either really dry or really wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got five inches of rain in an hour and
a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a lot of soil loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was almost in tears at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like apocalyptic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please check out this video and others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all the farmers that we talked to
would agree that they're taking the
[SPEAKER_04]: actions that they are because of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the apple farmers in Western New
York, there's a net zero farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did not do that for climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did that because he wanted to have
control over his energy costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say maybe that doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a net zero farm and we should share
his story and get other farmers to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That they can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our extension team again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea here is that we don't have
the funds, nor would these experts have
[SPEAKER_04]: the time to work on climate change solely
for 100% of their job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think it's more important
that they incorporate this into the work
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Kitty just told me on the call that she
did two talks last week that explain the
[SPEAKER_04]: cover crop tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the growing degree day tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're incorporating what their
climate and the resources and tools into
[SPEAKER_04]: their work with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are the resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our undergrad is working on getting new
fact sheets from Peter Woodbury up here on
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of things up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming you all have a good
understanding of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to explain this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be something that I would talk
about with farmer audiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we do, we need to think about
mitigation, which is reducing emissions
[SPEAKER_04]: and adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a long time in climate science and
policy world, policymakers didn't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: go to work on adaptation because it would
be like admitting defeat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we start working on adaptation,
we're not going to reduce emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a definite change whereas
we know even if we mitigate, we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Peter is the expert in the room on much
more than I am on these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are tools on the website that we
are linking to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And much more could be done at Cornell to
find out if farmers are actually using
[SPEAKER_04]: these tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: To what extent are they doing greenhouse
gas audits on their farm?
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't have the resources to do that
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other term, as I mentioned,
is adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of examples of some
great resources out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of which came from the USDA climate
hubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's this adaptation resources
workbook that's now online.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at it, it's pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's identifying a process that farmers
can use to look at what's happening on
[SPEAKER_04]: their farms specifically, and then
evaluate the different management options
[SPEAKER_04]: they have, and then adaptation approaches,
and then monitor and review if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: making changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So an example of that, these are the key
strategies that that adaptation resource
[SPEAKER_04]: is highlighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sustaining fundamental functions of soil
and water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So protecting water quality, improving
soil health, and then all the way down to
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we found, we actually did an online
climate smart farming course and had some
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers use this workbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that easy to use,
and it's pretty complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 100 pages long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our team thought that it would be
much more useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a resource like this that's a
short, very factual assessment of what are
[SPEAKER_04]: the six key things that you may already be
doing as a farmer, but that will help you
[SPEAKER_04]: increase resiliency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is one of the sheets I have in
the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our team worked on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us longer than we thought because
we didn't want the language to be vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted it to be really specific to what
farmers could actually do, and that helped
[SPEAKER_04]: review this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to turn now to the decision
tools that are on our website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are really fortunate at Cornell to
have the Northeast Regional Climate Center
[SPEAKER_04]: here on the 11th floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's led by Dr. Art Degatano.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they maintain all of the climate data
for the Northeastern United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: for NOAA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the purpose of the center,
there's a center in different regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Northeast region, is to make
climate data available for stakeholders to
[SPEAKER_04]: use the data and understand the climate
and how climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by working with NRCC, we've worked
to make some very specific web-based
[SPEAKER_04]: decision tools that can be used anywhere
in the Northeastern United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: from Maine down to West Virginia for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any one of you, if you live in Ithaca,
you can enter your address.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the left-hand side of the tool is
where you enter your user information.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some user inputs on the water
tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You enter what kind of soil you have,
what type of crop you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get some pretty specific
information about where you are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: season, based on the different tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the amazing thing about these tools,
there is a complementary system called
[SPEAKER_04]: NOAA, which is based on small weather
stations and data from these small
[SPEAKER_04]: stations that farmers have purchased and
put on their farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cost about $1,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a large network of them now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're not near one of those
stations, you're kind of out of luck in
[SPEAKER_04]: using their tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a really nice complementary
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this shows you the tools that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's climatesmartfarming.org.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first tool is a really powerful
growing degree day calculator.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that we talk about the fact that
this one is different from many others out
[SPEAKER_04]: there is that it's updating on a daily
basis the data, whereas many, if you
[SPEAKER_04]: looked in a aggregate agricultural book 50
years ago and looked at the charts for
[SPEAKER_04]: growing degree day calculations,
it was using a static calculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might have been updated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the calculators out there use
a static date that's 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is updating on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here the ranges.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would put any address in the Northeast
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you would put your planting date or
put March if you have, whatever date if
[SPEAKER_04]: you have a perennial crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you would choose your GDD base.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would show you where you are in the
season.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the tool right now,
Brian has not hit switch to start this
[SPEAKER_04]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we just got an email from a
farmer in Virginia asking, it's already
[SPEAKER_04]: spring season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to think about maybe
starting the tool earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can go back and look at last
year's data and all the way back,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, very far back, many years back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a planting tool, a farmer can look
at what happened last year or the year
[SPEAKER_04]: before when they planted, what date they
planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kitty O'Neill and Elizabeth are
planning to do really short little video
[SPEAKER_04]: clips to talk about for farmers that this
is a really it's an agronomic tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they can use this to do some
planning decisions about exactly when to
[SPEAKER_04]: plant or different crops that they may
plant with different growing degree days,
[SPEAKER_04]: where were they last year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was the end of the season?
[SPEAKER_04]: And make some much more informed
decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is showing you the period of
record here is the black.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the growing degree day
accumulation up to that date.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a forecast here, which farmers
really like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks at the next five, six days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see that it's also just
an educational tool because this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: 30-year normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the 15-year average.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oftentimes, this image isn't showing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But oftentimes, this growing degree
accumulation for a year will be way above
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have used a different screenshot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any questions about that tool?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other tool that we developed really
based on Kitty's input of working with
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers is that we need a cover crops
scheduler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because oftentimes, what's happening is
that we have an unusually wet or cold
[SPEAKER_04]: spring, and farmers can't get into the
field to plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're trying to make a decision
on whether they can get that cover crop
[SPEAKER_04]: established in time to where it would be
enough of a profitable venture by the end
[SPEAKER_04]: of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have three cover crops in there
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the data that we have working with
researchers on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had other data, we could populate
this more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian also added this feature.
[SPEAKER_04]: With farmer input, which shows the last
first and last freeze dates, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: really helpful for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another tool that we have is this
water deficit calculator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what the screenshot is
showing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, it's showing 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you enter your soil water capacity and
your crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you plant it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether or not you've irrigated.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have not irrigated, you just leave
this blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you will see the chance that you have
or might have severe plant stress based on
[SPEAKER_04]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does have a forecast on there as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a tool that was really useful
when we had the very dry period a few
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the newest tool we've developed is
called Climate Change in My County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a conception for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't really sure how maybe farmers
are not the most interested in this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but policymakers would be or agencies,
county agencies, Farm Bureau.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you go into this tool,
you would come into the Northeast right
[SPEAKER_04]: off the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would show you what is the general
warming in each county, what's the warming
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that with the exception of
these few counties, unfortunately down
[SPEAKER_04]: here in more conservative West Virginia,
that wouldn't want that data.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, it's been a warming
trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what you can do is over here,
you can pick your county.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the choices here if you want
to see average temperature, high
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, days with, highs above 90
degrees, growing season length,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then total precipitation, extreme
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can also look at the climate
change projections for those temperature
[SPEAKER_04]: or precipitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is showing you that the projected
increase in temperature through the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the century based on climate models,
the data that we have, through the
[SPEAKER_04]: Northeast Regional Climate Center,
showing in this county, we are projected
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a lot warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice because all of these dots
are the observed data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a significant trend in
warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it shows where we would be by the
end of the century.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a long-term planning tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really where the Institute has
been trying to get is we can tell you how
[SPEAKER_04]: things are more variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can give you more accurate information,
help you with specific planting and
[SPEAKER_04]: cropping decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can also think long-term the same
thing with rainfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, should I start thinking about
irrigation or tile drainage if I know that
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the trend?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have done more and more training and
outreach.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are two events that we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twilight meetings on farms in Madison
County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oneida County last year, which were
great because we had the soil lab there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also were able to demonstrate the
tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Kevin Ganow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an ag expansion specialist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was explaining exactly how you could
use that growing new 3-day calculator with
[SPEAKER_04]: planting decisions in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a Wi-Fi device.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was live.
[SPEAKER_04]: People could put their address in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to switch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the last couple minutes and talk,
connect this to where we are globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Matt mentioned, I've gone as a
trained in global policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: My love is to work globally and connect
that to the local level.
[SPEAKER_04]: This past year, I taught global
environmental climate science and policy
[SPEAKER_04]: with Natalie Mahowald.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took 17 students to the UN climate
change talks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johannes went on the delegation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we're at the COP meetings,
we have an exhibit of Cornell's research,
[SPEAKER_04]: climate research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about what we're doing here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a huge interest in climate
change and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talk about the tools that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say, can we get those tools in
our country?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what are you doing in Ethiopia?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we know globally there is a lack of
access.
[SPEAKER_04]: Accurate weather station and climate data.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a huge need and a huge interest
in digital agriculture and decision
[SPEAKER_04]: support tools globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Cornell's expertise, they could be
connected to the landscape scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a need also then to develop
similar extension or training and outreach
[SPEAKER_04]: programs globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried developing a proposal for
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't get funded.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the proposal is still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And connecting that to some of the work
that I do as a social scientist,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we think about global climate change
and agriculture policy, there's policy
[SPEAKER_04]: that takes place at the global level
through this United Nations framework
[SPEAKER_04]: convention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single country that came to the
Paris agreement in 2015 had to come with a
[SPEAKER_04]: national plan of how they were going to
reduce emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also many of them included adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of those, probably 60% of those
included climate smart agriculture in
[SPEAKER_04]: their plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So especially developing countries are
very keen to work on to get resources and
[SPEAKER_04]: technology and get help with adaptation in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if we think about policy,
you have to think about what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: national government policy and how is that
global policy going to be translated to
[SPEAKER_04]: the national level and then down to the
local level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I could give you a whole talk on
the Paris agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, it's been signed by 184
parties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the US is still a signatory to this
agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every party, with the exception of the
United States, every country in the world
[SPEAKER_04]: is a party to this agreement now,
is agreeing to the goal that we will
[SPEAKER_04]: reduce emissions to keep our global
temperature at well below 2 degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: Celsius with the intention to keep it
below 1.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you heard the climate talk last
week from Natalie Mahal, she was a lead
[SPEAKER_04]: author on this 1.5 degree report from the
IPCC that looked at whether or not this is
[SPEAKER_04]: even possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you think about this global
policy, all these countries have agreed to
[SPEAKER_04]: work on this, then how does that translate
to the work we need to do on agriculture?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there is a new process that was
agreed to at last year's COP called the
[SPEAKER_04]: Core Nivea Joint Work Program on
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something where I went to track these
meetings, tried my best to track these
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings for the past two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's basically that the implementation
committee in the UN and the technology
[SPEAKER_04]: committee are working together to think
about what are the global challenges for
[SPEAKER_04]: addressing climate change in agriculture
and what are the needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the last COP in Poland,
there was an all-day workshop with 11
[SPEAKER_04]: agencies reporting on what they are doing
on climate-smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the United States had representation
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some farm bureau and some other ag
agencies were represented there to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: track this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A key summary from a group called CGIAR is
that these conferences are crucial to
[SPEAKER_04]: further climate action on agriculture,
but progress has been slow over the past
[SPEAKER_04]: 24 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we need to think about at Cornell,
but also at all these different levels,
[SPEAKER_04]: how can we complement the negotiations
with initiatives to speed up adaptation
[SPEAKER_04]: and mitigation in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll end up the talk by talking about
this concept of climate-smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you are familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, a good number.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really came out in the last few years
as a way to advance policy and work on the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground with farmers and it's really based
on three pillars of looking at adaptation,
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigation, and sustainably increasing
productivity to reduce global food
[SPEAKER_04]: insecurity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came about in 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some controversy about this
term even on our campus where people have
[SPEAKER_04]: asked me, are you sure you wanna work on
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the controversy is that the term
wasn't well-defined before, the concepts
[SPEAKER_04]: were not well-defined before this got put
out by the FAO.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some believe that global corporations
like Monsanto will have undue influence
[SPEAKER_04]: and pushing this agenda to push one agenda
where there's still conflicting ideas
[SPEAKER_04]: about what is the best way to mitigate
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what's the best way to adapt to climate
change in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel like it's a useful concept
and a useful process.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a global alliance for
climate-smart agriculture that Cornell is
[SPEAKER_04]: a part of and I try to help them as much
as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a voluntary network and they
share information and share resources,
[SPEAKER_04]: including with businesses, because they
argue that if we don't get companies on
[SPEAKER_04]: board, and be talking with them and farmer
organizations, then we're not gonna really
[SPEAKER_04]: make progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just be working on small scale
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to work on all types of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is some work that I've done
and I guess I would end up talk by saying
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a lot of work going on globally
on climate-smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a need to scale up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear this term all the time globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a need to scale up adaptation at
the same time as mitigation and
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable intensification, but there's
different interests and it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to strengthen capacity and
extension and research globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some key takeaways from the talk,
and then I'm happy to answer questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that climate change is already
affecting farmers in New York State and
[SPEAKER_04]: globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting when you go to the COP
and you actually talk to a farmer from
[SPEAKER_04]: Africa and I'll ask them, what are you
experiencing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll say, extreme rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll say, wow, we see some of the same
challenges globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers acknowledge they are experiencing
climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to figure out the best way to
engage them on this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Social science is really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to understand what farmers think
about this issue, what tools and practices
[SPEAKER_04]: they're using, what they have available to
them and what they can do, what they need
[SPEAKER_04]: to adapt and mitigate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The climate and agriculture tools can help
farmers make much more informed decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say, I hear this again and
again, extension globally and in New York
[SPEAKER_04]: State is really critical and there needs
to be more funding and support for
[SPEAKER_04]: extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last point I would make is that I
would love to see more engagement globally
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see cows say this is a
priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be engaged globally on climate
change and agriculture is something
[SPEAKER_04]: Johannes has really been talking about for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a bill in front of the New York
State legislature for carbon farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just reintroduced with a whole bunch of
new sponsors on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plan would be to subsidize farmers
for the economic value of the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestered by various types of on-farm
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a tax credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just comments on whether you're
familiar with the bill, whether,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Ag and Markets is supposed to come
up with this model, which I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not quite up to that task,
given their presence that thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just thoughts about that model and
whether the science is there to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for prime time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether they've contacted you about
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a social scientist, so I would defer
the science question back to Johannes or
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard about the bill filtering
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the prospects that it's going
to get passed this year, but it is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we should be tracking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mention it, but there is a New
York State climate resilient farm
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of that funding goes to Ag and
Markets to put technology in place,
[SPEAKER_04]: like manure covers, through the Ag
Environmental Management Program,
[SPEAKER_04]: AEM.
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a little bit of research
funding that came here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't really tracked that bill
other than I knew it was out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Alison, for coming to talk to
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to hear your opinion on the
disconnect between the aims of your units
[SPEAKER_01]: and your program and some of the official
recommendations that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell University that are really counter
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notably, our recommendations related
to nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not adaptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not mitigative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow for highly excessive rates of
manure and nitrogen fertilizer with
[SPEAKER_01]: implications on carbon sequestration,
nitrous oxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really this contradiction
between what progressive programs like
[SPEAKER_01]: yours are trying to do and what we stand
for as an institution in terms of what our
[SPEAKER_01]: formal guidelines are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm aware of the challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think we could do to bridge
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, bring some good science to it,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold a high-level meeting with other folks
involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find out the best ways to get farmers to,
I don't know, the best tools and
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of things that we sort
of officially promote through guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's time to, if we have
programs like this, which I think is great
[SPEAKER_01]: and I support, it's time to kind of
revisit what we are otherwise
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these recommendations are
highly outdated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have very limited credibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, we say this is the other
hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to follow up with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question is, on one keon,
do farmers have 100% agency in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: the development of these climate storage
tools and their ability to use them on
[SPEAKER_02]: their farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers have 100% agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally in charge of what they're
doing on their farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other hand, farmers have very
little agency and they're embedded in a
[SPEAKER_02]: system that makes or forces their hands at
a lot of decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, on that spectrum,
where do you see New York farmers and how
[SPEAKER_02]: does your program address wherever that
location is on that spectrum?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's ever asked me that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are you thinking of the decisions
that are not that they can't because of
[SPEAKER_04]: the system?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you thinking because of seed that they
have to buy or
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to produce more milk to stay
solvent, which then leads to a certain set
[SPEAKER_02]: of practices?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I would say to that that this
is a challenging time to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: climate change in this for the dairy
industry right now because they are not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be able to make large
investments.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't have the money to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say that it's an additional
stressor to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're already doing things like
they're already thinking about low till or
[SPEAKER_04]: they're thinking about soil health,
many of the progressive farmers are doing
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of these practices and practices are
not new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then making them aware that over time if
they do these things or they prioritize if
[SPEAKER_04]: they know that flooding in this area of
the farm is where they're getting hit the
[SPEAKER_04]: most, then they prioritize adaptations
that would help with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I try to answer your question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see from your presentation that
extension is pretty involved where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: targeting individual farms and introducing
them to these tools or helping them use
[SPEAKER_02]: these tools that have been developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that is going into how much
work do you say is going into looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: larger groups or organizations of people
or policies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if I had more time and I am a
policy person, so I understand that we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be thinking about how do we
interact with Farm Bureau or how do we
[SPEAKER_04]: make changes as Cornell to the Farm Bill
that just got passed or we think about
[SPEAKER_04]: state and national policy the way we've
tried to do that is just stay engaged with
[SPEAKER_04]: New York State agencies and let them know
the resources we have, but we're not being
[SPEAKER_04]: asked to do policy analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Peter is or others, but we could be
doing more in that area as Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're out of time, but just a quick
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of similar to Anne's
previously, but when you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: globally, you have a lot of same issues
because people don't own the land they
[SPEAKER_03]: work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both in terms of making decisions and also
in terms of they're not interested in the
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term option to go to land.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you expect your policies to change
when you are working in a local community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they may be interested in protecting
the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they own very small plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a challenge and that's why I
think we can't just have these global
[SPEAKER_04]: initiatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to look at what every country is
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they proposing for adaptation and
climate change?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at it, it's often very
vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then even if they have a national
policy, is that actually getting
[SPEAKER_04]: implemented with input from farmers on the
ground?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Humphrey Fellows here and we
had a really interested fellow who is now
[SPEAKER_04]: the climate change and agriculture focal
point for Punjab, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's on Facebook and she posted that
they have a brand new CSA plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her idea, she wanted these decision
tools to be put in place with a plan that
[SPEAKER_04]: every farmer, the government just paid
every farmer to get a smartphone,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if they're really small scale
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we could be doing alerts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be sending out alerts of when
they might see a pest or when they might
[SPEAKER_04]: need to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think people are thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really big challenge and something
exciting to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
