[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to welcome you to Simon Joe's
thesis talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Simon is presenting his talk today,
but he won't actually have his defense
[SPEAKER_02]: till December sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: This summer, I think the faculty voted to
have imminently graduating students do
[SPEAKER_02]: their talks in the seminar series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Simon is the test case for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we seem to have gotten a very good
turnout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon came to us from Shenzhen via the
University of Washington in Seattle and is
[SPEAKER_02]: a PhD student in Plant Biology Department.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, however, has more of an ecological
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like many ecology students,
he wanted to work on a project that has
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely nothing to do with his thesis
advisors research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also meant then that Simon's
thesis has been almost entirely solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all funded through TAships and grant
studies written, which is also typical
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, Simon came to me wanting
to work on pathogens on roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not something I have a lot of
experience with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned a lot from Simon in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Simon has also really pioneered new
research methods in my lab, specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolomics and quantitative genetics or
genome-wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, has been very
creative in combining those two research
[SPEAKER_02]: methods and doing quantitative genetics of
large-scale metabolomics and really doing
[SPEAKER_02]: very nice analysis of large data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then applying that, as you see here
from his picture and now somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: shortened title, to looking at
fusarium-maze interactions of fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: infection of roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, Simon, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone, for showing up today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure everybody
hear me all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we can start.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, George, for the surprisingly
kind introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I have to revise my
acknowledged section now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's maybe a little bit too mean-worded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will think about that while I'm
giving the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, I'm going to tell you about what
I've been doing for the past three and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half years, which is looking at trying to
identify cellular and physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of maze biochemical defense
against fusarium breminiarum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as George mentioned, when I first
joined George's lab, I really had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very vague idea about what I wanted
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing I know is I want to work
on root-microbe interaction, which George
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't really do any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to George, and I say,
I want to do this and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And George said, OK, the only possible way
you can get some money from me is if you
[SPEAKER_01]: work on corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really narrowed down the things I
can do here, which is corn root disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I know absolutely nothing about at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started from Wikipedia, which
surprisingly, there is a whole page of
[SPEAKER_01]: giving all the maze diseases that are
possibly out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I find out about fusarium
breminiarum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fusarium breminiarum is a destructive
and widespread fungal pathogen that
[SPEAKER_01]: infects maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the tissue type and
developmental stages of that interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get sideline blight, stalk rot,
or ear rot in maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year, these three diseases
caused by the same pathogen collectively
[SPEAKER_01]: give you hundreds of millions of yield
loss in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pretty economically relevant
pathogen to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first started to work on this
pathogen, we really wanted to just have
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of symptom or phenotype to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through artificial inoculation
experiments, we see that fusarium can
[SPEAKER_01]: induce significant reduction in the total
root growth in the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this can be quantified by taking a 2D
picture like this and then use a computer
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithm that is developed in Leon
Cochin's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually quantify that and compare
and show that this is statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this phenotype actually is repeatable
and consistent enough such that we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: it to screen a natural diversity panel and
see if there's any natural variation in
[SPEAKER_01]: this fungus-induced morphological change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, when we do that across a
diversity panel, we see that B73,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the reference maze genotype where
we initially started with, turned out to
[SPEAKER_01]: be one of the more susceptible genotypes
with its total root growth being reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: by over 50% after fusarium inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas we also see there are four
genotypes that does not show any
[SPEAKER_01]: significant reduction in their total root
growth after fusarium inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they turn out to be our candidate
resistant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my work, I've been focusing on this
genotype, MO17, because it has the most
[SPEAKER_01]: available genetic resources out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will come back to that later to
explain what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go any further, we really
want to confirm that the symptoms that we
[SPEAKER_01]: observe actually tell us something about
resistance level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that by measuring, for example,
fungal gene expression, mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_01]: production, as well as visual symptom
scoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by all three matrices, consistently we
see that MO17 turned out to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant than B73 against fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can actually ask the question,
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the genetic and physiological
mechanism behind this contrasting
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance level between these two
genotypes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're answering these questions taking
a quantitative genetics approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you with less background
in that, so there are genetic populations
[SPEAKER_01]: that's produced by crossing B73 and MO17
are susceptible and resistant genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then produce what we call a
recombinant inbred line of populations
[SPEAKER_01]: with shuffled genomes between the two
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do then is to measure some
kind of quantitative phenotype so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can statistically associate this phenotype
with a particular locus or loci within the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the question really come down to
what kind of trait, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitative trait do we really want to
measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're working with planned
disease, supposedly what we really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure, what actually matter,
is the disease symptom severity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that impact your yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that impact your crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does come with a lot of advantage of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, the result from such a
study would be much easier to translate to
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tend to identify the loci with the
most major effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You capture environmental influences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technique for phenotyping is
usually simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, on the flip side of this,
we can also try to quantify some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical or molecular markers in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the advantage of doing that will be
you kind of get some idea about what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism behind the resistance you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetic architecture of this kind
of traits are usually much more simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can, very importantly,
you get very consistent and accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: quantification, which are hard to achieve
under field conditions for disease
[SPEAKER_01]: severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps more important for graduate
students, it's much less work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we forget about the less work and
simple technique, just say we really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which kind of phenotype are we going to
choose for our particular pastoral system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we come back to seedling blight
disease caused by Fusarium specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see that consistent scoring of disease
symptom severity is very hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: either in field conditions or even in lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms are in the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you going to measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, if we come back to the
historical statistics, we see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling blight severity varies widely
from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, this is when I started
working on this disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, there's been a linear
decrease in disease severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somehow I feel like I should take
credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, but the point I'm trying to make here
is that the environmental impact seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really large for disease severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, there has been work done with
Fusarium-Maze interaction, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: done in years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's been shown is that the genetic
architecture for this interaction is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many genetic loci seem to contribute to
the disease resistance or to disease
[SPEAKER_01]: severity phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taken all three factors together,
we decide to measure biochemical markers
[SPEAKER_01]: under laboratory conditions, rather than
doing any kind of disease severity
[SPEAKER_01]: scoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we decided to do is to take
seedling root samples of B73 and MO17
[SPEAKER_01]: recombinant embryo lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take those samples, subject them to
LC-MS analysis of the metabolome,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as a new technology developed by
Karl Kremblin here at Buckler's lab using
[SPEAKER_01]: a three-part mRNA seed technology to look
at their transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we combine the metabolomic data
with the quantitative genetic setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do some kind of metabolite QTL
mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we combine the two omics data sets,
we can start to do cross-omics network and
[SPEAKER_01]: system analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the work I'm going to present
today will come out of this two analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: here, combining the three methods here,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first story I want to tell you from
this study is looking at just comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: B73 and MO17, our two parental genotypes,
with or without fungus inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm showing here are cloud plots,
and each bubble here represent a single
[SPEAKER_01]: mass feature that a mass spec machine can
detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in green, I'm showing the metabolites
or the mass features that are
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly upregulated by fusarium
induction.
[SPEAKER_01]: In red, are significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the take-home message is that
a lot of bubbles in B73, not so many
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles in MO17.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that tells you is that B73,
the susceptible genotype, seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly responding, metabolically
speaking, to fusarium inoculation,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas there's not so much going on in
MO17 in terms of its metabolome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do then is we can compare
the constitutive metabolome of the
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible B73 and the resistant MO17 and
ask, what are the difference there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the differential metabolites will
likely be related to resistance against
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not so surprisingly, we find a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are over 700 mass features that are
significantly different, which is still a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to work with, like which one should we
actually look at then?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a second comparison looking at
fungus induction in B73.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we found over 300
metabolites or mass features that are
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look for the overlap between
these two, which means these metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: are both constitutively different between
my susceptible and resistant genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as being responsive to fungus
inoculation, those will be my high
[SPEAKER_01]: priority pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find less than 100 mass features
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I filter out the ones that have low
intensity, that's harder to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we find about 30 mass features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So among these 30 mass features,
there are some known metabolites with
[SPEAKER_01]: bioactivities against fusarium,
which will be good positive control for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to show that this approach is actually
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're actually more interesting
are the unknowns here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the unknowns?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the unknowns that really capture my
eyes are these two mass features shown by
[SPEAKER_01]: their negative mass to charge ratio here
and retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from now on, I'll just refer to them as
A19 and 777.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that in both B73 and MO17,
they are inducible by fungus inoculation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are constitutively different
between our two genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really interesting to me then
is that the structure seems to be related
[SPEAKER_01]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kitty Zhang in Frank Schroeder's lab
helped me to purify these two compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and perform 2D NMR on them to clarify
their structures here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a sucrose backbone right here
connected to them, one ferulic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: two ferulic acid, and then different
acetyl groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the only difference between
these two metabolites is this one
[SPEAKER_01]: additional acetyl group here on the two
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these metabolites have previously been
reported in medicinal plants, such as
[SPEAKER_01]: Smilax.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Smilax china.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they go by the names such
as Smuglacide C and Smilacide A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are names given by the natural
chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're fine in this kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, they're really dear to heart
because I kind of grow up eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in China, you can make this dark
jello-like thing from Smilax, and
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly it will be enriched in this
Smuglacide and Smilacide compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just have it as a dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're related to resistance against
Fusarium, then we want to show,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there any in vitro bioactivity against
Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did an in vitro liquid culture
assay, we see that the triacetylated
[SPEAKER_01]: Smuglacide C does not show any significant
activity against Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the biacetylated Smilacide A show
you a significant growth inhibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice that the concentration of
Smilacide A is actually lower than
[SPEAKER_01]: Smuglacide C because this is reflecting
their in vivo concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even at low concentration, the
diacetylated Smilacide A seems to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: bioactive than the triacetylated
Smuglacide C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can ask the question,
why is there natural variation for these
[SPEAKER_01]: two compounds in our population?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we measure these two compounds across
the recombinant inbred lines, which can
[SPEAKER_01]: help us to identify the genetic loci that
is controlling or associated with these
[SPEAKER_01]: two metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps not so surprisingly,
we see a colocalized quantitative tray
[SPEAKER_01]: locus, or QTL, at the beginning of
chromosome 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we subset the recombinant inbred
line population by different alleles at
[SPEAKER_01]: this locus, we see that for the ones that
carry the B73 allele, they preferentially
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulate Smuglacide C, just like B73,
the parental line, whereas it has less of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Smilacide A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty good segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we want to confirm the mapping
result from recombinant inbred lines using
[SPEAKER_01]: a different genetic population called near
isogenic lines, also generated from B73
[SPEAKER_01]: and MO17.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, we find that when we have B73
and MO17, here the phenotype I'm measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: is the ratio of these two metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: In B73, we have a lot of Smuglacide C and
not so much Smilacide A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a very low bar, whereas in
MO17, it's the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at the near isogenic
lines, some of them look just like B73,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the latter here annotates what's the
genetic background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though, for example, these two
lines, the genetic background is MO17,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does have a B73-like phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have example from the other side,
whereas even if you have a B73 genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: background, their phenotype looks just
like MO17.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do a t-test between them,
we see that there is indeed a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between these different near
isogenic lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top, I'm showing the genetic
map associated with all these near
[SPEAKER_01]: isogenic lines, whereas in red,
I'm showing the B73 allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: In blue, I'm showing the MO17 allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the correspondence
between the phenotype and genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can actually further narrow down our
QTL area to less than 600 kb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this particular area would contain the
gene that we think is causing the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in Smuglacide C and Smilacide A
constitutive abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, these two compounds are only
different by one acetyl group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at this QTL result,
we say, OK, that's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for acetyltransferase that's
going to add acetyl group to Smilacide A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when you look at there,
there's no acetyltransferase there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, this whole project looks
kind of dead in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a small genetic area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably a dozen genes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't know which one we should
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I was taking a vacation and
visiting my wife last December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really bored in her office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to play with some of this
data I saw that was hopeless at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to plot out all the MO17,
B73, and their recombinant embryo lines
[SPEAKER_01]: based on their constitutive concentration
of these two compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I noticed something rather
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know all along that MO17 has a lot
of Smilacide A, not so much Smilacide C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know the opposite is true for B73.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all this time, I've been assuming
that all the recombinant embryo lines
[SPEAKER_01]: should be distributed kind of in a
negatively correlated way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we assume that, or if we
hypothesize that there is a difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: acetyltransferase, then you should have
either a lot of the substrate or a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you will have a negative
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see that, you see a clear positive
correlation trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, more than that, there seems to
be two separate classes, one being more
[SPEAKER_01]: like MO17, the other being more like B73.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, if only there is one way I
can draw a line here and separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the advantage of marrying
a statistician becomes really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, my wife said, oh,
you just need a linear discrimination
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis to be done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly what she did for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we showed that we can actually
separate the recombinant embryo lines into
[SPEAKER_01]: the MO17-like ones versus the B73-like
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can separate this population based
on their phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two phenotypic classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we say that there's some kind of
genes that's causing this discrimination,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the expression of that gene should be
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between my two phenotypic classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly what I did when I
compared the gene expression data between
[SPEAKER_01]: these two phenotypic classes across the
entire genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I'm showing the negative log of
p-value based on students' t-test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that the genes that are most
significantly differentially expressed
[SPEAKER_01]: between these two phenotypic class indeed
locate right within my QTL area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I zoom into this QTL area, the gene
that's most differentially expressed is
[SPEAKER_01]: acetylene-insensitive 2, which is an
acetylene receptor that's positively
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating acetylene signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at the segregation within
the population, we see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: recombinant embryo lines that have a
phenotype that just look like B73 tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: express IN2 at a much significantly higher
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would lead us to the hypothesis
that IN2 expression, and hence acetylene
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling, is a positive regulation
regulator of smidacide A to smyglocide C
[SPEAKER_01]: transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can test that hypothesis,
ideally by looking at IN2 mutant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not available in maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the next best thing we can do,
which is looking at acetylene biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: mutant, which constitutively make less
acetylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we compare B73, it's well-typed
genome background, and ACS26 mutant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which produce less acetylene, indeed we
see that there's less smyglocide C and
[SPEAKER_01]: smidacide A being produced constitutively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's even more exciting is that we
can actually rescue this phenotype by
[SPEAKER_01]: exogenously adding acetylene back to this
sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the well-typed background,
you can actually induce these two
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds with exogenous acetylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this experiment, we have
demonstrated that two novel compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: found in maize, smyglocide A, smyglocide
C, and smidacide A, that are related to
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium resistance, are positively
regulated by acetylene signaling in vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, how does this fit in with the
literature about acetylene and fusarium?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in barley and wheat, it has been shown
that acetylene actually contribute to the
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptibility of fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, for example, if you treat
barley leaves with acetylene, you get
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger symptoms and more fungal canidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in wheat, if you have a transgenic
line that produce less acetylene,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have a less severe phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this fit in with our result really
well, because we show that acetylene
[SPEAKER_01]: promotes smidocide A, which is the
bioactive compound, transition into
[SPEAKER_01]: smyglocide C, which is the deactivated
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like the smyglocide C and
smidocide A provide some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical link between acetylene
signaling and fusarium resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, we've looked at two particular
metabolites that are significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: different between the two genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we cannot do, unfortunately,
is to tell you how much these two
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites actually contribute to
resistance quantitatively, because we only
[SPEAKER_01]: find acetylene as an important factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot specifically manipulate these
two compounds in vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, if you look back, we found over
700 metabolites or mass features that are
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly different between the two
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any one of those could give you a
disproportional impact on fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really no reason I can tell
you that this two compound that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you is much more significant than
every other thing in these 700 pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I did show you is that we can do
QTL mapping with mass features.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that does lead us to somewhere in
terms of the genetic control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can do QTL mapping for two mass
features, there's really nothing to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: us from doing it for all 700 mass
features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing is that instead of
showing you loss score for two
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites, I'm going to show you the
distribution of QTL for all this 700
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in result, on this plot, on the x-axis,
I'm laying out the genetic locus in their
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomal order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on y-axis, instead of looking at how
strongly that particular locus is
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with one particular metabolite,
instead, I'm measuring how many
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites that give you a significant
QTL at that particular locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately, we recognize this tower in
bin 2.09 towards the end of chromosome 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really interesting because bin
2.09 has been previously associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple disease resistance before in
maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then our question is, what's happening
in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the genes that's affecting all
these metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because collectively, they affect over 70
mass features.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about 10% of what's different
between these two genotypes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there only one gene in there that's
affecting all these metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are there just multiple genes that's in
a short genetic interval kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: clustering together?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you translate that into physical
distance, we still have about 8 megabytes
[SPEAKER_01]: to cover, and hundreds of genes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we can't possibly come up with
any candidate genes just by looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: this plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did there, then, is we can get
to the QTL by doing metabolite QTL
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can also look at the expression of
genes and then ask the question,
[SPEAKER_01]: how is gene expression correlated with our
metabolite abundance across this
[SPEAKER_01]: recombinant inbred line population?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our hypothesis is that if there's only
one gene in there, then that one gene
[SPEAKER_01]: should be significantly correlated with
all the mass features that map to this
[SPEAKER_01]: locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if there are multiple genes in the
interval, each regulating a subset,
[SPEAKER_01]: then only the subset and their regulator
gene should be correlated with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the result that we got from
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I'm laying out all the
transcripts across the genome of maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the y-axis, I'm measuring the
median Pearson's correlation coefficient
[SPEAKER_01]: of that 75 mass feature with each
transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we start to see this very clean
signal within our QTL region in bin 2.09.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we zoom in there and ask for each
transcript, what's the number of mass
[SPEAKER_01]: features that has that particular
transcript as the single most correlated
[SPEAKER_01]: transcript?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that we have a clear winner in a
putative vesicular transport protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would suggest that this single
protein is regulating many metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to actually support that hypothesis,
we found two independent mutation
[SPEAKER_01]: insertion lines that has this particular
gene knocked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we can confirm the insertion,
we see that there's a trend of decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: this very important metabolite,
defense metabolite called dimboa
[SPEAKER_01]: glucoside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I have no statistics to
support my claim because this is based on
[SPEAKER_01]: very small sample size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're in the process of bulking up the
seeds so that hopefully soon we'll add
[SPEAKER_01]: asterisks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will show us that indeed,
the vesicular transport protein is
[SPEAKER_01]: important for the metabolism of defense
metabolites such as dimboa glucoside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could a vesicular transport protein
related to secondary metabolism?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one way we look at it is, how about if
we look at biosynthetic pathway of
[SPEAKER_01]: benzoxenoids of which dimboa glucoside is
a member of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that because without the
glucoside, diboa, dimboa, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: benzoxenoids are highly cytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for plant cells, it actually makes
sense for them to be kept in the vacuole
[SPEAKER_01]: and the microsomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that the biosynthetic genes
should also localize in the cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: compartments, which are made from
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is some kind of disruption in
the vesicular transport protein or in that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular vesicular transport protein,
then there might be something disrupting
[SPEAKER_01]: this entire biosynthetic pathway as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I've been done all these studies
within the realm of B73 MO17 recombinant
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've shown you we can do mapping with two
metabolites or we can do mapping across
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire metabolome.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are limited genetic
diversity looking at this recombinant
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've shown you, there are only slightly
over 700 mass features that we can map
[SPEAKER_01]: with this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I hope I've convinced you is that
this experimental approach of combining
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolomics, transcriptomics,
and quantitative genetics is really
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful when it comes to dissecting the
secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to take this approach,
extend it to a much more chemically
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse genetic genome-wide association
study panel, which includes over 280
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we found more than 3,900
mass features that we can dissect using
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're lucky that the same diversity
panel, the transcriptome, has only
[SPEAKER_01]: recently been analyzed by Karl Kremblin
here in Ed Buckler's group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use the exact same tissue type,
and we try to keep the growth condition as
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at this will be the emergence,
certainly looking at the tip of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: the base of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we harvest the tip and base of all
these over 280 lines and then perform
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing, before we even go into
the genetics, is we try to parse out the
[SPEAKER_01]: vast data set that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we explain the variance in this
pretty big data set?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we see is that the
tissue type seems to be really important,
[SPEAKER_01]: not so surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the base and tip seems to clustering
very well with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means we should probably analyze
those data sets separately from each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to visualize this is that if
we can do two-way ANOVA on every single
[SPEAKER_01]: mass feature and say, how are they
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Either by tissue or by genetic
subpopulation or interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see the vast majority of them are
significantly different based on tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: type, whereas by genetically defined
subpopulations, less of them are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to metabolomics,
the always bothering question is,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people always ask, this is great,
but what are the metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, not like in transcription,
you can map to the genomes and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this is this gene and this is that
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really say that with
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only very limited information we
have in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we want to say, what are the
metabolites that's driving the
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiation between different tissue
type, we really have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to address that question, I look at my
chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a UV absorption chromatogram
from my analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning, things are more
polar, and at the end, things are more
[SPEAKER_01]: non-polar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I come to realize is that you can
actually divide this based on their
[SPEAKER_01]: retention time or based on their relative
polarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that these are physiologically
relevant because we can click into every
[SPEAKER_01]: single peak in here which represent a
metabolite and look at their UV absorption
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that the peaks in this area tend
to have identical or similar UV absorption
[SPEAKER_01]: profile that's characteristic of phenolic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, peaks within this area looks
like benzoxinoids, and peaks within this
[SPEAKER_01]: area looks like flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably not so surprising if
you think about if they are the same class
[SPEAKER_01]: of compounds, which means they are
structurally related to each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: then their polarity should be more or less
similar to each other as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means we can divide, we can subset
our chromatograms into different groups
[SPEAKER_01]: and then putatively say, are they
different in this retention time range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can say, oh, maybe they're
different mostly because of phenolic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're different mostly in this
area of the chromatogram, then it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids that's causing the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indeed, when we look at this,
we can plot the negative log of p-value
[SPEAKER_01]: from our previous two-way ANOVA analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see is that each dot here
represent a single mass feature,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're not distributed uniformly
across our chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when we compare tissue type,
we see there are significantly more mass
[SPEAKER_01]: features that are significantly different
within the flavonoid time range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when we look at the mass features
that's differentiated between
[SPEAKER_01]: subpopulation, they're almost exclusively
within the benzoxinoid range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually compare the negative
log of p-value from two-way ANOVA with
[SPEAKER_01]: another one-way ANOVA and then say,
is there any significant difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between each retention time group?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're eyeballing is actually
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for tissue type, most of
differentiating parts are within the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoid time range, whereas for the
genetic subpopulation, they're mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiated based on benzoxinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that actually happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if we compare the lip tip
and lip base, and this is total UV
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption, absorption profile,
and we see that there's clear absence of
[SPEAKER_01]: any flavonoids in the leaf base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that flavonoids are exclusively
found in the tip of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the primary driving factor of
differentiating this true tissue type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at genetic-defined
subpopulations, we see that benzoxinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as in this case, dimboa, is
significantly lower in tropical lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the same tropical lines tend to
accumulate a different benzoxinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: compound called H.
[SPEAKER_01]: dimboa glucoside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do find out the same thing,
looking at specifics, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: global analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, I've been showing you analysis
based on a priori knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that the different samples can
be categorized into either tip or base,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they can be categorized into different
genetically-defined subpopulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about if we just examine this big
data set without any a priori knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know, how are the mass
features distributed across my entire
[SPEAKER_01]: population?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these two plots, again, I'm
analyzing the tip and base data separately
[SPEAKER_01]: from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the x-axis, I'm looking at the
frequency for each mass feature at which
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, this is a histogram,
whereas on y-axis is how often they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that both in tip and base,
we have a bimodal distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are about 15% of all the mass
features that we detected are found almost
[SPEAKER_01]: ubiquitously, like over 90% of the
genotypes that we examined have these mass
[SPEAKER_01]: features.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas we also have this significant
tail, over 30% to 40% of the metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: are only found in less than 20% of the
entire population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this really, really highlights
the vast chemical diversity that's
[SPEAKER_01]: existing within this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think of this kind of as
essential metabolites that's found
[SPEAKER_01]: ubiquitously, and then something like
expendable metabolites, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also see that there's actually a
significant difference in how this
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution look like between the two
tissue types, such that in the base,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have more of the expendable
metabolites, whereas in the tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution is actually more flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bimodal pattern is less obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I first got this result,
my concern was really, are these tails
[SPEAKER_01]: really just noise from a metabolomics
analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are the exact same pattern
you would expect from LC-MS noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to occur in very small subset of
your entire population, and they're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of accounting a big part of your data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will kind of suck if you publish
this and find out, oh, all these are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually just noise, not true metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one characteristic associated with mass
pack noise is that they also tend to have
[SPEAKER_01]: lower intensity, because they're just
machine noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not representative of true
metabolites found in samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I decided to test is to see,
does the occurrence frequency somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: correlate with the intensity of a mass
feature?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in both tip and base, we find a very
weak positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does seem like the ones that occur
at lower frequency tend to have lower
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also see that this distribution is
so broad, you have mass features that
[SPEAKER_01]: occur, for example, almost less than 10%
of the population that have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity than the ones that's found
ubiquitously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do think that most of the mass
features that we are finding here are not
[SPEAKER_01]: noise from the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you have already noticed that
across this positive correlation,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also have noticeable exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these mass features here are occurring
less than 20% of all the genotypes we have
[SPEAKER_01]: examined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are found at very high intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're colored based on a 95% confidence
interval of a linear regression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to look at some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are these mass features that are
there but occurring at high intensity?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at this three,
for example, showing one of them have a
[SPEAKER_01]: mass to charge ratio of 353.5,
we see that actually you can find the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same mass to charge range in other
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in this genotype called
4226, we have these two metabolites with
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular mass to charge ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in CML45, we have a completely
different peak showing up that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same molecular weight but different
retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are actually occurring at much
higher intensity so that you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: original two peaks tend to be really short
or really small in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means I interpret this as a rare
isomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have the exact same molecular
weight but different polarity,
[SPEAKER_01]: so different 2D structure so that they
elude at a different retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at all three of this,
what's really interesting is that all
[SPEAKER_01]: three of them show you the exacts have a
shared MS-MS or tandem MS fragments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this metabolites can be fragmented so
that you get the parental ion but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: fragment ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see all three of this rare but high
intensity metabolites have a shared
[SPEAKER_01]: fragment, which means they are
structurally related.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do the mass between them,
you have a hydroxylation and a
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that further strengthens our hypothesis
that they are probably structurally
[SPEAKER_01]: related with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at occurrence of these
three metabolite or three mass features,
[SPEAKER_01]: so here I'm showing a pseudo phylogeny of
my 282 population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the lower, the color plot in
blue, I'm showing where that mass feature
[SPEAKER_01]: is being detected at high intensity
whereas in yellow they're not detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that most of the time there
are co-occurrence, which means when you
[SPEAKER_01]: find one of them, all three of them are
probably there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this strongly suggests that these three
metabolites, they're rare, they're high
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, and they're structurally
related to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really want to now look for what's
the genetic basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we sometimes have this rare
isomers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why sometimes we have the more common
ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that, again, that's when we need to
do the genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we actually look at any of this
unknown metabolites, we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that our GWAS is actually working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when we go back to our old
friend benzoxinoids where we previously
[SPEAKER_01]: used biparental mapping population of this
metabolite and then correctly identify
[SPEAKER_01]: their respective biosynthetic genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to use this as our positive
controls for the GWAS study and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: can we recover the same gene using the
same mass feature or the same metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we map with dim-2-ball glucoside,
we found its biosynthetic gene BX13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we map with H-dim-ball glucoside,
not only do we find the previously
[SPEAKER_01]: identified biosynthetic gene BX12,
we also found this significant SNP unknown
[SPEAKER_01]: located towards the end of chromosome 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got sidetracked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know, what is this unknown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I have another SNP here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know BX12 is a biosynthetic gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this another biosynthetic gene here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I go to the genome and then
look at B73 versus CML247 genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CML247 is a tropical line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, previously I mentioned tropical
lines tend to have higher amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: H-dim-ball glucoside.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when we compare their genome,
there doesn't seem to be any structural
[SPEAKER_01]: variation in terms of presence,
absence.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where our GWAS SNP has are
located.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our clear candidate at this point will
be this gene right here, which encodes a
[SPEAKER_01]: protein phosphatase 2C family protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we look at this is I go back to
Carl's expression data and then plot out
[SPEAKER_01]: this expression across our entire GWAS
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take the two tails of this
expression distribution and then compare
[SPEAKER_01]: their H-dim-ball glucoside metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, we see that for the lines that
express this gene at high level,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to have significantly higher
H-dim-ball glucoside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be strong evidence suggesting
that the expression of this gene at least
[SPEAKER_01]: is cosegregating with our metabolic
phenotype, which means this would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: very nice candidate genes to say,
does that actually regulate H-dim-ball
[SPEAKER_01]: glucoside biosynthesis or metabolism in
vivo?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good side story from the
positive control.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the rare isomers we're talking
about earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did genetic mapping again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is rather preliminary data at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd use a slightly different genetic
data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we find out is that these three
potentially structurally related
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites map to the same exact locus
towards the end of chromosome 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably not too surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structurally related ferroloid sucrose
is mapped to the same locus as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is within this locus then?
[SPEAKER_01]: So lucky for us, one of the lines that
have this rare isomers again is CML247,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we have the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we compared a genome of CML247 with
B73.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is a 40 kb insertion
specific to the CML247, which contained
[SPEAKER_01]: four putative gene models, one of them
being a putative ensocyanin biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ensocyanin is also in the
phenopropanoid pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that maybe this is what we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, I think at least we
have preliminary evidence associating this
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 kb insertion with those rare isomers
that we observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, I've been, again, looking at
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, I mentioned there are over
3,900 mass features that we can map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just do that one by one and
look at that manually for every one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, that take probably 3,900 graduate
students to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, I compile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're GWAS results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, on the x-axis,
I'm looking at genetic locus or SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm counting for each SNP or each
genetic locus how many metabolite GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: hits that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we start to see these towers
coming up, which means small genetic locus
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with large parts of the
metabolome.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what are the metabolites that map
to there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's always a question about what
are the metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the mass features?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, remember, I've already come up with
a putative solution to that, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at retention time.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see is that structurally
related metabolites tend to have clustered
[SPEAKER_01]: retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do then is to say,
if we measured the variance of retention
[SPEAKER_01]: time of mass features that map to the same
locus, that give us a measure of how
[SPEAKER_01]: structurally related are those.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this plot, I'm measuring the log of
variance of retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the background level up here,
and you start to see all these valleys
[SPEAKER_01]: dipping down, which means the mass
features are physically clustered together
[SPEAKER_01]: on the chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we compare this plot to the GWAS
result, we have almost perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: correspondence.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you have a peak on the number of
GWAS hits in the genome, you also have a
[SPEAKER_01]: valley in the retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that tells us is that structurally
related metabolites tend to be regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: by the same locus in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say that out loud, it makes a lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you want your data to say that to
you, it takes a little bit more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually try to identify what
are the genes or what are the structural
[SPEAKER_01]: variants there that's associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that in red, there are,
for example, known benzoxenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthetic genes that we can recover
from this analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in blue, there will be the
putative unknowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, what have I told you today?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've told you three stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we discovered two metabolites that
has not been reported in maze before,
[SPEAKER_01]: called smilocyte A and smilocyte C.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think they're related to
fusarium-graminarum resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we show you that acetylene signaling
and probably IN2 expression is positively
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating this acetylation reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we extend that from single
metabolite to across the entire metabolome
[SPEAKER_01]: to show you that correlation between
metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: can help us to pinpoint candidate genes
from quantitative genetics results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we extended that same
approach to a much more diverse GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: population and show you at a global scale
that structurally related metabolites tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to be co-regulated by the same locus in
the genome.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, I think that's
all of my research part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to take a pause here before
my long and emotional acknowledgment
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody forget about your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to take any questions you
may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot to consider here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of nice work.
So when you look at sampling the tip,
which is a well-differentiated terminal
differentiated tissue, in the base of the
leaf, we have still many cells elongating,
some differentiating, depending on where
the status of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Across the 282 diversity panel,
wouldn't you suspect that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: variation still within the base of the
leaf?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could be influencing some of your
results, too, when you look at the
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolites there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the major concerns is
when we do a GWAS, we hope to explain the
[SPEAKER_01]: variance in phenotype, by variance in
genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's no way you can talk about
that outside the framework of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be differentiation in
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, many of the genotypic
difference we saw probably can be
[SPEAKER_01]: attributed to different biological
differences in rate of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to do that as consistently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we map to an oxygen response
factor, that's also biologically true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's biologically relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not just looking at biosynthetic
enzyme in secondary metabolism pathway,
[SPEAKER_01]: per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
Good question.
First, when you talk about 353 isomers,
but then you show that they're actually
different by oxygen and methylene group.
They're not isomers.
They're derivatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do they have the same mass in the
isomers, or they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, I probably didn't say that very
clearly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 353, they're isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go back,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to mess up somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both these chromatograms are done with
master charge ratio, the same master
[SPEAKER_01]: charge ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two are isomers, because they
have the same molar weight, but different
[SPEAKER_01]: retention times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm saying is that this is only
one of these dots up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 369 and the 383s are the other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying these three are isomers of
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rather, there are a series of rare
isomers, which you can find a more common
[SPEAKER_01]: counterpart in other genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question is, if you look at the
chemical diversity of the 700 compounds
[SPEAKER_05]: from your first part, do you have an idea
if there are some classes of compounds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are they related to each other in any
way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, can you say the first part of your
question again?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you say how chemically diverse they
are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently, the data is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use the same kind of retention
time analysis to say, where are all those
[SPEAKER_01]: 700 mass feature located in my
chromatogram?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives us some idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess, based on the GWAS results,
is that they're probably mostly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: benzoxanoid pathway as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my guess, but I don't know
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the beginning of your slide,
you showed a screen on mid-polarity
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what about if you take other
classes, say more sugars, or what would
[SPEAKER_05]: happen then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you choose this particular range
of hydrophobicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at this, remember,
I know towards the end, kind of your serum
[SPEAKER_01]: just fall out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry for the fungal biologist here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, we're trying to look at
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to look for metabolites
that's associated with biochemical
[SPEAKER_01]: defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we decided to use a 50%
methanol extract, where we get most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called mid-polarity metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you look at sugars or primary
metabolites, they are important for
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But traditionally, they're not associated
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you can make the argument to
say, why are you not looking at lipid
[SPEAKER_01]: lipids?
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you're looking at
metabolomics, it's never comprehensive per
[SPEAKER_01]: se.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the argument we are making here are
limited to really, if you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatogram, we really see primarily
three major classes of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see phenolic acid, we see benzoxanoids,
and we see flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you anything about sugars or
lipids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to what we were doing.
I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, at the beginning of my
slide, I make the argument that
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical and molecular markers are less
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this doesn't look like less work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you try to correlate what we
observe here to any kind of, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: disease symptoms that we can measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think correlation will be a little
bit too ambitious to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can do is to do pairwise
comparison, which you cannot do if you
[SPEAKER_01]: started out the quantitative genetics
approach by directly scoring symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, since we have identified
specific locus that's associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites that are probably associated
with resistance, then we can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's find a mutant in this particular
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can do pairwise comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any significant difference
between my mutant versus well type that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know are only different by this
biochemical phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I'm planning to do
with the vascular transport protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in that case, I have a very
specific manipulation genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say, not only can I test,
is there any biochemical difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between my mutant and well type,
is there a significant difference in their
[SPEAKER_01]: biological phenotype in terms of disease
resistance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we cannot do that for the
ferulose sucrose part because it's IN2.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you knock out IN2 or if you disturb
acetylene pathway, yeah, you will see a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say that's because the ferulose
sucrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are 2,000 other things
that's also changed in people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea on the mechanism of
these compounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're primarily working against
cerium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of the ferulose sucrose membrane?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the ferulose sucrose, you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, the smiglus IC and smidus IA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_06]: What compound is active?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of mechanism?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, I would say, two classes of
mechanisms that's been associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first class, for example,
phenolic acid, has been shown that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: in vitro activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that somehow it's biocidal or
it inhibits the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So molecular mechanism, we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So antioxidants are thought to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, probably something
more relevant is that usually phenolic
[SPEAKER_01]: acids are associated with structural
fortifications, the word I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vast majority of the phenolic acid you
found in planta are actually esterified to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been shown that one of the first
response to fungal infection is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have this major induction of phenolic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to all go to our cell wall
and reinforce our cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the two compounds that we found
actually play a role by reinforcing the
[SPEAKER_01]: cell wall, then we would not have captured
that activity with the in vitro inhibition
[SPEAKER_01]: assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the last analysis that we did,
you showed that values of metabolites are
[SPEAKER_05]: a good way of finding genes that are
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that approach is more biased
towards finding large effect loci in the
[SPEAKER_05]: genome range.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also have MQTLs for other 3,000
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are your thoughts on prioritizing
that list for the analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got exact same questions before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my idea is that now that we are,
I think we are in an era where data
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, it's always going to outpace
data analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this kind of global analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you try to dive into
specifics, you have to go in with
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say, OK, now I associate this
metabolite with some kind of biological
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype that I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can go in to say, what are the
genes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are my GWAS results?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I believe will be valuable from
this analysis is not necessarily the final
[SPEAKER_01]: correspondence between structural
relatedness and a particular genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: locus, but rather, in the future,
if you have a candidate compound that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go to this data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GWAS result is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just go and say, what is my
candidate gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, you reduce entire PhD
thesis to two experiments with the
[SPEAKER_01]: maturation of CRISPR and other genome
editing technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, OK, here I have a very clear
candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've altered that, do I have a chemical
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have a biological phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the way this resource
can be used in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pathogen localization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't thought about that too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can transform this fungus with GFP
and then do fungus tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that initially, it grows
intercellularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the intercellular phase,
it produces mycotoxin and kills the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cell and then move into a more
intracellular slash necrotrophic phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, for all the metabolomic QTL
analysis, we did it constitutively.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fungus induction whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all the earlier induction
experiment that I did, there are six days
[SPEAKER_01]: post inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they barely start transitioning into
the intracellular phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not exactly sure how metabolically
the plant will switch as the fungus switch
[SPEAKER_01]: from an intracellular to an intracellular
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's been a lot of
transcriptomics analysis done on that
[SPEAKER_01]: front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably a good way to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my advisor is just reminding me I also
have an acknowledgment to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also wants to have lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I'm not sure I have the
luxury to do anymore now that I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: on a Friday time slot is that you have a
very, very long acknowledgment to
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize everybody in my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, I wouldn't be the person I
am without all their help and their
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to restrict my acknowledgment to
all the people I've met here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to recognize all my
collaborators here without whose work none
[SPEAKER_01]: of this will be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So throughout the talk, I hope you
recognize that this is a really diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use many, many different approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no expertise in any of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only expertise I have is to find
the right person and do the right
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want to thank everybody here
that helped me throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over my time here, I've also been
extensively working with students,
[SPEAKER_01]: both undergraduate and summer interns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make my life so much more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife and I can go to cruise tour
when they take pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I want to recognize all my lab
mates throughout this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's obviously been evolving over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to thank them for all
the inspiration, all the ideas I got from
[SPEAKER_01]: them, as well as their patience to listen
to all my brain dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to recognize my committee
members, Rebecca Nelson and Gary
[SPEAKER_01]: Bergstrom, who both have been really
inspirational, very supportive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and very resourceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, this project wouldn't
have been done without any of their help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, finally, I want to
recognize the advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the gender lab, it's kind of a
tradition that at your access seminar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to give kind of a famous
philosophical quote, directly actual quote
[SPEAKER_01]: from George.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the past, his bicycling habit has
been the subject of discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, I want to take this quote right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this happened when we're visiting
an alpaca farm in Trumensburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have pigs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what George said to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the context is I think it's,
oh, pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And George said, pigs are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They treat you equally as one of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's also the same kind of
philosophy that George has been using to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat his graduate students, that he
treats his graduates equally as one of
[SPEAKER_01]: himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do realize I need to give a little
bit more context next time I present in
[SPEAKER_01]: conference and say that George treat his
grad students like pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't quite come out right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, I want to
recognize everybody here who will take the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to say my time here in
Cornell would not be the same without any
[SPEAKER_01]: of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may not be collaborated directly on
my CSIS project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably met you in a class.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably worked together as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked together as teaching staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we probably were students together in
the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those interactions really gave me
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really owe a big time to all of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, from this project,
I think one of the message I got is at
[SPEAKER_01]: this time where the merit of diversity is
often being questioned and sometimes being
[SPEAKER_01]: attacked, I can reflect on my own
experience in Cornell and stay convinced
[SPEAKER_01]: that if life itself is an emergent
property, then our society and our science
[SPEAKER_01]: should also be greater than the sum of all
its parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
