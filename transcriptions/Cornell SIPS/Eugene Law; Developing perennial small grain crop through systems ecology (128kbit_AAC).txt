[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Tony said, I have been working for
the last four, four and a half years on a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of projects, all sort of within
this theme of developing perennial grain
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems and even the market
opportunities that Tony briefly mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good mix of agronomy and
environmental science and even economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get into that a little bit more
throughout the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a brief outline of
what we'll discuss today, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a brief overview of ecological
solutions to agricultural challenges to
[SPEAKER_00]: set the stage, then introduce you to the
opportunities and challenges of perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grain crops, which are new but have a lot
of promising aspects in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll then discuss two of my research
projects, one where we were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping perennials and annuals with
medium red clover, and another where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to mitigate a known yield
decline in one of these perennial crops
[SPEAKER_00]: using strip tillage in a more mature
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll just touch on some conclusions
and ways that we might move forward with
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains research before opening
it up for questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone here is likely pretty familiar
with some of the major challenges to
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural sustainability, particularly
from an environmental perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we'll largely focus on here
today, although my interests do span into
[SPEAKER_00]: the areas of social and economic
sustainability as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the right, we have a figure
that might be familiar to some,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of portraying the planetary
boundaries in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are areas where, as scientists
say, there's some agreement that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: exceeding the carrying capacity of our
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those areas might be nutrient
pollution, usage of freshwater,
[SPEAKER_00]: land system change, and all the effects
that it has on biodiversity and ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: function, climate change, of course,
and then some areas that we're really not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as clear on at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll point out here is anywhere
where you're seeing it going into the red,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're anticipating that we've already
exceeded some of these boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do something immediately to
try to mitigate and find solutions to
[SPEAKER_00]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would also note with this
diagram in particular, anywhere that has
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of speckling is sort of the
estimate of how much agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: contributes to these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, especially in the areas
that are outside in the red zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture is having quite a large effect
on ecosystems and the sustainability of
[SPEAKER_00]: our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to just discuss a few of those,
our current industrialized agriculture has
[SPEAKER_00]: many issues of soil loss and degradation
over time, water and air pollution due to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient runoff and greenhouse gas
emissions, as I mentioned, land use
[SPEAKER_00]: change, so deforestation and the shifting
agriculture when we do run into issues of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil degradation, for example,
a high reliance on synthetic fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, and fossil fuels, which over
the long term will not be sustainable as
[SPEAKER_00]: those resources become more limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as things like pesticide resistance
develop further, freshwater availability
[SPEAKER_00]: in some areas of the world is becoming a
challenge to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of that overall encompassing
threat of climate change and how we might
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt our systems to still be productive,
but also resilient in the face of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of I put in this bar to sort
of separate some of the areas that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think that perennial grains might
contribute versus some other things like
[SPEAKER_00]: food security and other social and
economic issues, which are heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: entwined in these issues, but might not be
solved by simply growing a crop that has
[SPEAKER_00]: some different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in particular, food security,
I'll highlight that there because as I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: mention in a few seconds, in these slides,
perennial grains currently do yield less
[SPEAKER_00]: food grain than comparable annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is one of the drawbacks
currently, and it's something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: informing a lot of the research that we're
trying to do to both increase those
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, but also think about how we might
balance the contributions of food versus
[SPEAKER_00]: other services, environmental or other
ways we can use the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broadly, it has been suggested that to
counteract some of these threats to
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural sustainability, we might be
able to restore ecosystem services to crop
[SPEAKER_00]: lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of ecosystem services,
which really became popular after the
[SPEAKER_00]: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment back in
2005, really focuses on the things other
[SPEAKER_00]: than material goods that we can,
well, including material goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: but other material goods and other
services we can get from our ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: the many ways that human society is
supported by the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these panels, we can sort of think
about a couple of different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a natural ecosystem, which is maybe
modified by humans, but is not designed
[SPEAKER_00]: for agricultural production, there may be
some amount of food and other crop
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think about foraging in these
contexts or fisheries or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's many other services that are
widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forest production, natural habitat and
biodiversity, water, air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we change those ecosystems into
an intensively managed crop land,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can really increase the amount of food
or fiber that we produce from those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're losing a lot of those other
services by simplifying the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: by going down to monocultures,
heavily managed, relying on external
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs, as I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, you can see these
bubbles are small, so suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be services in some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas, there's actually disservices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, water quality might be
impaired by an intensive crop land if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of runoff or nutrient
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, in thinking about perennial
grains, they sort of fit into this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop land with restored ecosystem
services, where we're trying to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to have a highly
productive agro ecosystem, but balance out
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those services by diversifying and
thinking about new ways of managing our
[SPEAKER_00]: crop land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might not get the same magnitude of
crop production, but we're restoring a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other services that we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And focusing on perennial grains,
there's a lot of opportunity at this
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to think about is that annual
grain crops are take up about 70% of total
[SPEAKER_00]: global crop land and account for about 70%
of human food calories if you account for
[SPEAKER_00]: both direct consumption and animal feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's costly if we think from an
environmental perspective, if we think
[SPEAKER_00]: about all those detriments of intensive
crop land environmentally on the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with recent advances in breeding and
biotechnology, perennial grains are really
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching the point where they could be
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is amounting support both
amongst the agricultural community and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers to have more multifunctional
agriculture that can provide things other
[SPEAKER_00]: than just food and calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, there has been some
research done showing evidence for
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial crops as part of an integrated
cropping system, being more resilient and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of all of that,
there's been a big push both from the food
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and from research funders to
support some of these projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that these certain perennial grains
are right on the cusp of breaking into the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in particular that I've worked with
and you'll hear about a lot is kernza or a
[SPEAKER_00]: type of intermediate wheatgrass that has
been put into the first commercial food
[SPEAKER_00]: product available this Longroot Ale from
Patagonia Provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Cascadian Farms, which is an organic
branch of General Mills, has really jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: on to kernza and is in R&D with breakfast
cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a Kickstarter campaign with one
of those cereal bars, other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of their goals ultimately that they've
stated is to have kernza in your Cheerios,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your breakfast cereal at some point in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really do see the value of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both to diversify what they're using in
their supply chain, but also to satisfy
[SPEAKER_00]: certain commitments they've made for
corporate sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a research funding perspective,
you might have seen things like this
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Chronicle article about a grant
that Matt and other collaborators received
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here a picture of kernza bread
from Wide Awake Bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: From one of our research projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also recently in the last couple months
learned of a 10 million USDA cap grant
[SPEAKER_00]: going towards the development of a kernza
consortium across many institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of momentum in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really does provide an
opportunity to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to iterate, these are all of the
institutions that at least in 2018,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working on perennial grain
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we are in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get into a little bit more detail
about why perennial grains have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental benefits, one thing to note
is having crops in the ground year round
[SPEAKER_00]: and many of these perennials have more
extensive root systems than annuals to aid
[SPEAKER_00]: in their persistence can really contribute
to soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this diagram, thinking about a
potential crop rotation of perennials with
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals after several rotations of annual
crops where the soil may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat depleted of organic matter,
planting a perennial that over its three,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five to 10 year lifespan can
contribute to restored soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not less tillage during that
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more opportunity for crop biomass
to go back into the soil, can restore that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health and lead to an overall cycling
of soil health throughout time in this
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another potential use is in areas that are
particularly prone to erosion or areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where infiltration can be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see an annual crop,
which is lying most of the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the off season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the crop's been harvested and
there's just stubble remaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of potential for soil
detachment and erosion and less potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for that water to actually infiltrate back
into the groundwater versus a perennial,
[SPEAKER_00]: which throughout the year has green
biomass growing and roots deep into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be much less runoff and also the
potential for higher infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can think a little bit
further than just the perennial crop on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own here on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be potential for things like
grazing and dual purpose use, which I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: mention, but also the possibility of
perennial polycultures and how
[SPEAKER_00]: diversifying within the field can add to
things like pollinator or even other
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could see of this as a
continuum from the monoculture perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe a dual crop of a perennial cereal
and a perennial legume to a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated system that might have a
variety of different plants with different
[SPEAKER_00]: functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets a little bit more complex in
terms of management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the focus of where I am at right
now with my research, we are sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on this area here where we can
think about intercropping and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have complementarity between a grain
crop and a nitrogen fixing legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, like I said at the
beginning, things like low grain yield are
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenge for perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new crops and they don't have
the decades, centuries of development of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cropping system, the investment in
infrastructure for the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding of things like how to
establish and harvest the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of agronomic challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some logistic challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things like fewer pest management
options without being able to rotate crops
[SPEAKER_00]: as frequently or use tillage as a tool for
weed management, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are opportunities, as I
mentioned, having a year round ground
[SPEAKER_00]: cover and those deep root systems can
really help protect the water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dual purpose use for grain and forage
production in the same year, utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: some areas that might not be suitable for
annual row cropping, areas that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: more sloped or close to bodies of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's likely some advantages in
terms of fewer field operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by planting once and then harvesting
from the same stand for many years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can avoid having that annual cycle of
tillage and replanting, which for farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: can become a bit of a crunch during that
high demand period for management on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be some labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some energy savings as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you recall back to the title of
this, we're thinking about perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grains through a systems ecology
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created this systems diagram very
early on in my time at Cornell just to
[SPEAKER_00]: help me conceptualize the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you took a very close look,
there's probably a lot of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: missing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add too many linkages between things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to look like a pile of
spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the point is that within
the system, there's the crop field itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plants, there's soil, there's
other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all of the assets owned by the
farmer that go into planting, harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: processing the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's all these external
inputs, some of which are purchased and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of which are natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the balance between what's natural
and renewable input can be a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of these other purchased inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the system can be supported by
interactions within the system to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these external things more or less
important in the overall production
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could think of things like external
soil amendments being added to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the soil ecosystem is healthy
enough, then there might be less need for
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really thinking about how the
system as a whole, all the pieces interact
[SPEAKER_00]: to make something that's greater than each
of those individual parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't really want to focus in
just on the crop plants and how we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the most productivity out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to think about all these
other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I've highlighted some areas
that I've really focused on with my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: research, thinking about soil health and
how perennials might be different than
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that respect, how the non-crop plants
weeds might interact with the crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could even think of non-crop plants
as things like a forage legume,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may not be providing grain yield,
but is also contributing to the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we are looking at the
productivity of the crop and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic side of things and how a
perennial at this point in its development
[SPEAKER_00]: might be economically viable for a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've conducted probably too many
research projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of commit to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I just highlight some of the
things we've been looking at to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: address some of these challenges,
try to provide answers, and just to better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these first two are the ones that I'll
focus on here today, intercropping with
[SPEAKER_00]: medium red clover and strip tillage
renovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also tried intercropping with field
peas, thinking about weed management after
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest during that regrowth period in the
fall, trying to figure out which
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides might be good for use in weed
management for perennial grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: also pathogens, and some more
physiological work, some more soil work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, as Tonia mentioned, the work
with Miguel Gomez and others in the Dyson
[SPEAKER_00]: School, as well as collaborations with
folks at Wide Awake Bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand what consumers would be
willing to pay for a perennial grain
[SPEAKER_00]: product and whether they would be willing
to perhaps pay more for something that has
[SPEAKER_00]: all these environmental benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just highlight here some of our
external collaborators, while everything
[SPEAKER_00]: up here is then really within Cornell,
but really also supported by so many
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the De Tomaso and Ryan Labs
that I'll acknowledge at the end as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I said, we'll be focusing on
these two for the purposes of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: through the next 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I'll introduce you to the two
perennial grain crops that we've focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left is Kernza Intermediate
Wheatgrass, or Thinopyrum Intramidium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a wild perennial grass that for
the last 40 years has been under
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication for grain production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that started at the Rodeo Institute in
Pennsylvania, eventually moved to the Land
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute in Salina, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really over the last five years or so,
has been one of the main perennial crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are interested in for the
reasons I pointed out earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: interest from the food industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of momentum built up
behind this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem to be one of the more
developed from a cultivar perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, we have ACE-1
Perennial Cereal Rye, which I contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: with Kernza as an annual grain crop that
has been perennialized via hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by crossing your cereal rye,
Caley Cereal, with Mountain Rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are hoping to introgress some of
those perennial genes, but maintain many
[SPEAKER_00]: of the characteristics of an annual grain
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like free threshability,
synchronous maturity, large seed size,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those actually are really what the
breeders are focusing on in Kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a domestication process goes along,
you're trying to make the small seed of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wild grass into something that looks like
a rye or a wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll contrast these in how they've
been developed from a cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but that contrast also does
play out in how they perform in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'll see in a few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the first research experiment
that I conducted, intercropping perennials
[SPEAKER_00]: with annuals with clover, we started this
one really thinking from that systems
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective with five broad research
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did want to understand how much grain
and crop biomass would be produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials in comparison with annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to understand the weed community
better and identify weeds that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in these perennial systems so
we could later target our management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to look at the soil health,
as I said, and then two that are great out
[SPEAKER_00]: here are the economic piece, which I won't
talk about today, and trying to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: would a consumer need to pay for a
perennial grain in order for it to break
[SPEAKER_00]: even from an economic perspective with
something like the wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then evaluating certain indicators of
overall system sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not necessarily life cycle analysis,
but if you're familiar with that concept,
[SPEAKER_00]: things of that nature and seeing how they
might compare broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, all of those things we're
really looking at with this single field
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, the experimental design was a
randomized complete block design with four
[SPEAKER_00]: main plot treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the four grain crops that
we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kernza, the intermediate wheatgrass,
ACE-1 rye, a hard red winter wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then two varieties of malting barley,
which in our colder New York climate
[SPEAKER_00]: actually didn't do too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually were dropped from the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to mention them here,
especially since they're in the diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these was grown in split plots
both with and without medium red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these plots in the field had
half of it grown as a monoculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then half of it with the medium red
clover frost seeded in March of each year
[SPEAKER_00]: for the annuals and then frost seeded in
the first year for the perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after growing the plants, we sampled
crop and weed biomass at grain maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: for each of the species each summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for wheat and barley, that's earlier in
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: For perennial rye, that's later in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kernza, it's actually in the middle of
August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does also, by adding these to the
cropping system, might diversify even the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned earlier, take some of
the burden off of growers that often are
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to get everything in at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by clipping the biomass and the weeds,
and the weeds were sorted by species,
[SPEAKER_00]: we threshed and deholed if necessary,
the grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So de-hulling is particularly for kernza,
which like I said, those characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of domestication, it has an adherent hull,
which is a little bit harder to process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the grain yield estimates
are based on a correction to 13.5%
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show a few photos,
just to give you an idea of what these
[SPEAKER_00]: look like in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the left, kernza interme
wheatgrass, about two months after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, and an eighth one rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say actually, when I put this into
PowerPoint, and it gives you those little
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions for like an alternative text,
PowerPoint thought this was a train going
[SPEAKER_00]: down some tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically picking up on the fact
there's not much green material here early
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with kernza, that's something we've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slower to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it gets going, it can produce a
lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in particular, in that first fall,
it doesn't look like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next spring, about April,
is when you actually start to see it fill
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that poses some challenges for weed
management during that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that did play out a little bit going
into the next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the kernza is now growing
pretty tall, but weeds did manage to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there in the meantime, and might be
competing with the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while the rye looks really good,
and there's very little weed biomass under
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it was able to get up, grow tall
quickly, and really exclude weeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after harvest in that first year is
when we noticed the real first contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: between, or I guess the second contrast,
other than establishment, between these
[SPEAKER_00]: two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kernza quickly regrew after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it here above the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ACE 1 struggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after harvest, the clover really took
over and seemed to out compete the rye in
[SPEAKER_00]: that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the story after three years is that
with clover in the kernza, we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a visual difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a little bit greener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's some extra nitrogen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both systems are looking pretty
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast with ACE 1 rye, both with and
without clover, where with clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ACE 1 rye was out competed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some rye plants still there,
but quite few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without the clover, all the rye got
out competed by other weeds that came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be even fewer plants
without the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what happened with ACE 1 is that
it wasn't competitive in that post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: period, and that sort of accumulated over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't do any weed management in
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to understand some of these
factors, being the first time we've grown
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that does seem to be a critical period
for weed control and something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other experiments, has been shown to
help with the persistence and productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ACE 1 going into assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second or third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for these first two objectives of
looking at grain yields and weed
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, I'll just go into some of the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our data analysis, I'm only reporting
kernza and wheat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the reasons that we just saw with the
ACE 1, there really wasn't much to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: of into the third year, and actually not
that much in the second year either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the winter kill of the malting
barley, we had dropped that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did look at crop and forage yields
and weed biomass for the kernza and wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed it with mixed effects ANOVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to log transform the data due to
skewness and had crop species
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping in year as fixed effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be seeing similar models for all
of these treatments throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: following slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get to weed communities
eventually where we have an ordination to
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize it and then permanova and
indicator species analysis to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in more detail in those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for grain yield, the main takeaways
here, there was a significant crop
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between crops and there was a
significant effect by year with an
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no effect of the clover
intercrop on grain yield, however.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, the story is with kernza,
it was lower than the wheat in that first
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then declined into the second year and
rebounded slightly into the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas wheat had statistically similar
yields throughout all three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be a slight decline over time,
but nothing significant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, the initially lower grain
yields followed by a decline is a major
[SPEAKER_00]: issue for kernza and something that we'll
even talk about a little bit in the second
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With forage yields, they were initially
similar, but kernza biomass tended to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase over time while wheat biomass
decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is one area of opportunity for
the perennial grains and used as a dual
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose grain and forage crop where a
grower might be able to balance out the
[SPEAKER_00]: low grain yields with high forage
production if they're able to use that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say as the perennial stay
greener for longer into the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the year, they do make a much
higher quality forage than something like
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat straw, which you could also harvest
from a wheat field, but not as valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I will say here, there was a
significant effect of intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so adding clover to the system
increased total forage production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't analyze forage quality,
but the higher protein of a clover forage
[SPEAKER_00]: might have increased quality as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at weeds,
really the story is that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference by species.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw with the slow establishment of
kernza, there were weeds early on and
[SPEAKER_00]: those tended to stay in the system
throughout the three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was again, a significant effect by
year and an interaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also say that the clover did have a
significant weed suppressive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there is quite a lot
lower weeds in the clover plots across all
[SPEAKER_00]: the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the weeds increased over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a difference between the perennial and
the annual system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually been other studies with
kernza where maybe they got established a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better where weeds are
suppressed by the kernza itself over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not something we saw here,
but it is another potential benefit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial system that's highly competitive
and persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we took a closer look at the
weed communities by species, here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: an ordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the axes are not that meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what we're looking at, these
centroids are sort of the central tendency
[SPEAKER_00]: of different treatments where the closer
together points are on the plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more similar they are in their weed
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of the green is the kernza both
with and without clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the brown or tan is the wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even here on this initial plot,
you can sort of see some clustering in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at this by year, we see a
definite shift in the weed communities
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 2017, kernza with and without
clover both shifted along this x-axis to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right, maybe in slightly different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also see with wheat a shift
initially to the right, but then sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: back again towards the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that there is
divergence between the communities of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds we're seeing in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to confirm that with the permanova,
which is really the statistical test here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw significant species and intercrop
effects and year effects with,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, this strong interaction between
year and crop, basically the perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: changing over time while the annual sort
of stay the same, maybe change them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at each year individually,
we see that the clover intercrop had the
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest effect in that second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's because that's when
the kernza was really coming into its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the third year, the kernza was
starting to outcompete the clover even.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at indicator species,
so what this indicates is that each time
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a significant p-value for a
species, it means that that species is
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly prevalent on plots of that
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can interpret this by looking in
2017 with kernza and no clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: a winter annual shepherd's purse was
really indicative of that cropping system,
[SPEAKER_00]: while wood sorrel was particularly
indicative of the wheat no clover cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't have any significant
indicators in 2018 with this data,
[SPEAKER_00]: but by 2019, we are starting to,
again, see that clear separation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the kernza and no clover,
we are seeing a lot of perennials,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Timothy and rough stock bluegrass,
perennial grasses, and then Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: goldenrod and dandelion, broadleaf
perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: With wheat and clover, we were seeing a
perennial sedge, yellow nut sedge,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was able to compete through that
clover and come up in that system and
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really seen in any of the other
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then wheat and no clover, we're seeing
start to see a broad variety of annuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: very common annuals, yellow, foxtail,
ragweed, and a couple of polygonums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, one thing you'll notice is
that with clover, there weren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: significant indicators because clover was
suppressing a lot of the weed species and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of evening things out broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without clover, we're starting to
really see that divergence between a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial and an annual weed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to soil health, sampling here
was done each year, including a baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: collection soon after planting in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we always sampled after
harvest, before replanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the annual plots were re-tilled,
we collected samples with golf hole cores,
[SPEAKER_00]: the relatively large diameter and to a
relatively shallow depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we analyzed both density in the
lab and then sent to the soil health lab
[SPEAKER_00]: for wet aggregate stability, soil
respiration, and active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I'll just say this upfront,
there wasn't a lot of variation between
[SPEAKER_00]: the systems over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with bulk density, we're seeing a
slight effect by year and an interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: by year in species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with wheat in one year, it might've
been a little bit higher than wheat in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different year, but nothing too dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: With wet aggregate stability, it was only
a year effect where we sort of saw a bump
[SPEAKER_00]: up and then down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with soil respiration,
there was simply a year effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be due to different
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, in particular, it was very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a lot to read into these.
[SPEAKER_00]: With active carbon, we did see a very
close significant crop species effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, there was slight slightly
higher active carbon in wheat than kernza
[SPEAKER_00]: across the three years when everything was
pooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a little bit perplexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really thought about it too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has any thoughts on why that
might be occurring, my initial thoughts,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just because we were sampling so
shallowly while the kernza roots are going
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper, there could be something going on
there, but not what we expected to see
[SPEAKER_00]: really with the soil health at all,
not much of an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the takeaways from this first
experiment are that the kernza was
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent and produced more total biomass
than annual crops, but lower grain yields
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACE-1 struggled overall and failed
completely by the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see that divergence in the weed
communities and clover had a strong effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on suppressing weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennial grass weeds like rough stock
bluegrass and timothy probably have the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest likelihood of becoming weed
management challenges in kernza,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly because there might be few
selective herbicides that are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: control those, especially after a kernza
stand has been established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get that stand going and you
don't really want to till it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: replant it, there might be some challenges
in getting some weeds out of there if they
[SPEAKER_00]: do establish a foothold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, soil health had stronger
effects by year than by crop species or
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would focus in here on this first
point about lower grain yields that
[SPEAKER_00]: decline over time, because that really
informed this second experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using strip tillage to renovate mature
kernza stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This decline is not unique to our
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been documented across basically
every research project that's looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: kerns over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not associated with plant
mortality as tiller counts and total
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass productivity are stable or
increase over time, which is something we
[SPEAKER_00]: have also observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, we thought about
what might be causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like maybe the kernza itself
was competing too strongly with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought that maybe using some
disturbance in that system might give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to regrow and produce more seed
rather than vegetative biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried two timings, fall and spring,
and wanted to look closely at components
[SPEAKER_00]: of yield to see what the response to this
disturbance might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really this was just a deep ripping
with a deep shank on the no-till planter
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing in pretty narrow strips and a
relatively low intensity disturbance,
[SPEAKER_00]: all things considered compared to other
things that people have tried with kerns
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a simpler experiment with just
three treatments per block, the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring, and then the control
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done in a fourth year kernza
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had been in the ground, had
harvested three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been planted in 2014, fertilized
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one application of herbicide due to
growing Canada thistle issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the zone builder,
went in after that third harvest both in
[SPEAKER_00]: October and then the next April.
[SPEAKER_00]: That following August at the fourth grain
harvest, we did similar quadrat sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: as to the first experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we also sampled 20 spikes from
each sample that were threshed by hand to
[SPEAKER_00]: count spikelets, florts, and seeds per
spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else was also threshed to
estimate total grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used a similar mixed effect model
with only tillage as a fixed effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's this photo I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to see anything, which is
actually we almost didn't harvest this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment at all because it didn't seem
like anything different was going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Chris took this photo on top of the
combine because it seemed like there might
[SPEAKER_00]: have been something going on here in the
fall, treatment, maybe a slightly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: density of seed heads while not much
visually different between spring control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you couldn't really see that till you
got up high on the combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really did play out to be an
interesting effect in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, when we looked at the components
of yield, there was really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency for spikelet count,
for floric count, for seed count,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even for 1,000 kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those within spike components of yield
were not changing amongst any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the total biomass that
was produced, so all of the vegetative and
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground biomass in these plots,
there was no difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: control and the fall treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a decrease from that spring
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the disturbance there was a
little too strong or too soon close to
[SPEAKER_00]: tillering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total tiller density was lower in both the
fall and the spring treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all stems in the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at reproductive tiller
density, so those tillers that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: seed heads, we see a significant increase
in the number of fertile tillers in a fall
[SPEAKER_00]: tilled plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to about a 60% increase in
overall grain yield, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: outstanding, is really what we're looking
for in using this management practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in harvest index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an increase in grain and a
slight decrease in total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that harvest index is something
we're really interested in at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the takeaway here is that this
fall tillage disturbance did increase
[SPEAKER_00]: grain yield by a large amount at that
following harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in the fourth year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by then, the yield had declined
substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the total grain production was
still much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: than you would get from an annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does provide insight into what
might be going on in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, our assumptions of
intra-specific competition is likely
[SPEAKER_00]: what's causing this change in the plant's
reproductive output over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With spring tillage, it did reduce the end
density in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't mention this on the data
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did not impact grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spring tillage didn't actually
decrease yield in that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could think maybe in the future
year that would have a similar increase
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, giving it time to regrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really, for the future,
we would want to examine even more closely
[SPEAKER_00]: the timing, the intensity, and even the
type of disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we use strip tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some of our collaborators in
the Midwest have done things like grazing
[SPEAKER_00]: or using strip applied herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there could be even broader things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like crop residue burning and whether
that stimulates tiller development,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, to wrap it up with
hopefully a few minutes for questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of things going on in these
perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the complexity is higher for both us
as researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more things we are trying to
figure out and manage here, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with the novelty of these systems,
like managing weed crop at different
[SPEAKER_00]: periods during establishment, during the
post-harvest period.
[SPEAKER_00]: During subsequent years and that crop-crop
competition with the perennial that's
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous in growing vegetative biomass
that might need to be stimulated in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way to maintain its seed production over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the complexity of managing something
for production of both grain and forage as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you balance that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ways that managing maybe mowing
at different appointments during the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something we've looked at a
little bit, might increase your forage
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity but might decrease your grain
yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a trade-off there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that work out economically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to the point we saw that over
through a three-year period, there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a strong effect on soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might even be wheat
outperforming currenza maybe just because
[SPEAKER_00]: of wheat growing more vigorously over that
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically the takeaway there is
restoring ecosystem service is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as just growing a new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crops may have a lot of benefits,
but they also need to be integrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: system across many spatial and temporal
scales with interacting with many other
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you manage that is all tied up
into what we actually can obtain from
[SPEAKER_00]: those systems, both in terms of material
goods and other services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of room for improvement
of these perennial cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't breed, but the breeders are still
working on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll be seeing improvement in
their performance over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like these projects that I've been
working on, the agronomic management will
[SPEAKER_00]: also have a significant impact on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I would say that these might not
be ready to put in the ground everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, this is the promising area of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully within the next couple of
decades, we'll be seeing currenza and
[SPEAKER_00]: arterios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, just acknowledging everyone,
I have pictures of all of the technicians
[SPEAKER_00]: and field undergrad assistants that have
helped over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, Tessandra, Chris,
and Scott, who have done just so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That long list of projects I've worked on
wouldn't be possible without all the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions of all these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My committee, of course, and all the lab
mates and fellow grad students that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all my external collaborators,
starting with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great board of advisors,
the folks at Wide Awake Bakery and Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground Flour on some of the economic side
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then external collaborators at other
institutions working also on perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, just these funders that
have graciously allowed me to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a little bit longer than I
thought, but hopefully we have time for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stick around a little while
if people want to ask me some stuff as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Eugene.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really a nice overview of the
various projects you've been working on
[SPEAKER_04]: related to perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have a little bit of time,
but go ahead, unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, David.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very interesting, Eugene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is kind of the upper limit of where
these yields could be due to people think?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you take a typical wheat yield,
let's say six tons, or you're up in that
[SPEAKER_05]: four or five, six tons or whatever,
where do people think these could possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: get to?
[SPEAKER_05]: If everything was right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a bit of a tricky question due
to just the time aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you account that cumulatively over
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that trade off?
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, I don't want to put hard
numbers on it, but you might expect in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year, maybe 25% of a comparable
wheat, like we saw in that one experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, we did see that sharp
decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there was a session at
Tri-Societies last week on this where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's sort of a bit of a debate between
one of the main breeders of kernza and
[SPEAKER_00]: then someone who's done a lot more work in
more perennial forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are life history trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for a perennial to survive
over winter, produce new stems the
[SPEAKER_00]: following year, it needs to dedicate
energy to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an annual is really putting all of its
energy into creating that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it dies, we harvest it, and we move
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be a substantial trade-off
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how close we could get to an
annual just based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also the balance of
photosynthetic production over the full
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a perennial like kernza,
once it's established, the following year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be starting growing much
sooner than a spring wheat because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there as soon as the weather gets warm
enough, whereas a farmer might have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for things to dry down and get the
seed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's there throughout the fall as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total amount of photosynthetic
radiation that's hitting that plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of the year will be higher than
the annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that might balance out some of
these trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's been studies done for
perennial biomass feedstocks like
[SPEAKER_00]: miscanthus that show that their total net
primary productivity is going to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher due to the higher amount of
sunlight they can take in over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we can get the plants to put more
of that towards seed production is the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that balances out with the
management of the system as a whole is
[SPEAKER_00]: where we would need to... That's where we
are moving forward, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know all those other benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You laid that out very nicely,
the complexity and how it might use in a
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just wondering if you were aiming for
grain yield, how high do the breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: think could it end up being 50% of what we
would otherwise would expect?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it be... Because you had very low
yields, 250 kilograms per hectare of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not criticizing, I'm just curious
where the community thinks this could end
[SPEAKER_05]: up going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my question about the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard to speculate, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, one thing I didn't mention is
that I've been working with these like
[SPEAKER_00]: kernza, for example, for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we planted that first experiment
in 2016, it was cycle three breeding from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Land Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now on cycle eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say just by going out to Kansas
for conferences and stuff that the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the plants in cycle eight
versus cycle three is just tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both the size of the inflorescences,
the number of spikelets and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: components of yield, which I didn't find
any difference in my experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: those over breeding cycles are increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's gonna be a lot of advancement
in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and in terms of what those newer
cycles would produce in an actual farm
[SPEAKER_00]: field at this point, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thanks Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, clear presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering sort of from the systems
perspective, whether you have thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about comparing with maybe sort of an
optimized a spatially optimized system
[SPEAKER_01]: using current more commercial cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking maybe strip cropping with
corn grain and alfalfa, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd be getting forage production,
you're getting grain production,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting perennials on half the land
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess what I'm getting at here is it
seems to me that by doing some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of practical optimization,
spatially you might get many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that you're aiming to get by
combining, trying to combine all the
[SPEAKER_01]: functions into one patch of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of folks that have
done that type of work and have looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: different cropping system sort of layouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even in like Matt's lab with
looking at different ways of using cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different ways to try to put
different functions back into the agro
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying here that perennial
grains are the only way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's promising because of
like at that one point at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: annual grains make up so much of the
cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have and if we're ever gonna,
basically we need to do something there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could somehow get perennial
grains to the point where they're just as,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to sort of David's point,
they're just as productive in grain as the
[SPEAKER_00]: annual and also producing forage and
providing these other environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like that has, that's sort of
like a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of ways to think about the
cropping systems we use and how we might
[SPEAKER_00]: innovate on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, does that sort of like address
that point, I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I appreciate all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I would maybe clarify what I was
just trying to get at is, when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing kind of alternative or what we
hope are improved practices, I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: would just encourage comparing that to
kind of the top of the line management
[SPEAKER_01]: practice for current production systems,
which might involve in some places,
[SPEAKER_01]: strips of perennials and annuals,
for instance, if there's an erosion issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more just sort of thinking about
what the baseline is that we compare,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, compare to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help clarify things a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that moving forward,
I think that that's an excellent place to
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of this, we really didn't
know what we were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we just, to explain our
thought process is to try to keep things
[SPEAKER_00]: simple and maybe not thinking so far down
the road of what is the most productive
[SPEAKER_00]: way to grow these, because we didn't
really know, but also just trying to think
[SPEAKER_00]: of, as our first baseline, it's like,
well, if we have an annual or perennial,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from moving from there to our next
steps of trying to optimize that and tweak
[SPEAKER_00]: it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your next question that's
revealed by some of those early results,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and I mean, I could probably
talk for a long time about what I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eugene, this is Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if maybe as a follow up to that,
you could talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem services gains that you
anticipate to be associated with the
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a lot of work on soil health
assessment, and there may be some reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: why you didn't see the difference based on
the soil sampling depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious if you think about
quantifying ecosystem services gains
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward from these systems,
what would you look at?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what kind of benefits do you think
you'd see if you expanded the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: quantification that you do?
Yeah.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'll say is just based on what some
of my collaborators have done,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seeing a lot of benefits in area
where there might be nitrate leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kearns, with those deep roots,
is able to really prevent nitrate from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting down to the water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been really good projects that
have shown soil health benefits over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we didn't have the length of time
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe, like you said, sampling depth is
an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go about a stratified cent of
down half centimeters and still processing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that data to see if there's
anything going on at depth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's folks in Kansas doing
things with gas exchange and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: better understand air quality and
greenhouse gas emissions and things from
[SPEAKER_00]: the system, doing sort of a net balance of
stuff in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I guess, wildlife and some work
with Ducks Unlimited and NRCS in
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation easements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the possibility of even having a
conservation easement that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest for a grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a policy question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go too far down that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinking about it, if the plant itself
is providing the benefits to the system
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want from a conservation easement
in terms of providing wildlife habitat,
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting water, then why not harvest it
if that's not going to do any damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just another way of thinking
about integrating it into a system and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking beyond current boundaries to how
that might fit in somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say my personal next steps
forward, one thing that I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: started to focus on more is just weed
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I'm in Tony's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we focus on a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we saw from that first
experiment, what if we had been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage weeds and kerns in that first year
and prevented them from getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: foothold that might have persisted
throughout the whole experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had been able to maine those decent
rye yields from the first year through
[SPEAKER_00]: three years, then that's a really
promising outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the past two years or so,
we've been doing some competition studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and also, like I mentioned, herbicide
screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in order to get any services
out of the system, no matter what they end
[SPEAKER_00]: up being, we need to have a productive and
effective system in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that includes all of these aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's actually one of the reasons
why it's so great to have such a great
[SPEAKER_00]: team of collaborators, both here at
Cornell and at other places, is that
[SPEAKER_00]: different people are looking at different
aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come together and try to figure out
how to handle it all together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're getting past time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if some people need to leave,
Eugene, if folks have other questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody, a burning question that you'd
like to ask Eugene?
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene, one quick question for me was,
what do we know from the consumer side of
[SPEAKER_04]: things?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are folks willing to pay a little more?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you kind of getting from those
results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're working on that paper with
Miguel Gomez and Dyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did last fall, fall 2019,
was a consumer preference testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we brought in a bunch of
people into a computer lab, gave them
[SPEAKER_00]: kerns of bread and then other breads,
also very nice breads made by Wide Awake
[SPEAKER_00]: Bakery, and asked them what they liked
about the taste and other culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities of the breads and also what they
would be willing to pay both with only the
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and once we provided them with
information about the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental benefits of the crops,
of the crops that were used to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had kernza at different levels of
flour incorporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had spelt as a comparison of
sort of an interesting but maybe not as
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologically beneficial grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the high level takeaways there are
that people did not like the taste of
[SPEAKER_00]: kernza bread as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a general consumer pool,
and it's more branny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have a bit more of a grassy
flavor or sort of like nutty flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've eaten a lot of kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the general consumer market,
maybe not their taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do give them that
environmental information, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to pay more for the kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's both with and without tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more I think was maybe like 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the yields, how low they are,
you would still need to, the production
[SPEAKER_00]: cost trade off, that's something I'm
working on in terms of the breakeven
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, would need to be fairly high if
you're only getting a 5% price premium at
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is showing that there is some,
potential for almost thinking of it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: payment for services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's marketed right to maybe the right
audience, it could have that benefit as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael, I see you have a chat question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you wanna unmute and just ask it or
would you like me to read it off?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could just ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is a little apropos of Peter
Woodbury's question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of this as being part of a step
towards these more complex polycultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious, I mean, that's sort of
the original attention behind the programs
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Land Institute, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious, what are some of the more
critical bottlenecks that resolving those
[SPEAKER_03]: would get us closer to the polyculture
idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's a couple of things
from an ecological perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just need to do more work on finding
the right mixes and the right sort of both
[SPEAKER_00]: spatial and temporal distributions,
like how you combine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of a polyculture in the
field all at the same time or over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's more of a rotation,
but in thinking about the large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically figure out which plants work
well together and how they work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big challenge after that is
how, I think harvesting is particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging, especially if you're trying
to get multiple, we did one experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: with putting perennial grains and then
field peas together and tried to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really difficult,
just the differences in sort of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity timing and the height of the
things you're trying to harvest and having
[SPEAKER_00]: the right machinery to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think even just that step of once you
have a polyculture where the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get along is having a system that
supports that in terms of having machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even with CURNSA by itself,
we've struggled so much with just getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it combined and then process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using stuff that's designed for
wheat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And CURNSA is not wheat, but that's what's
available to growers and even to us as
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a big barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on one of my takeaway slides,
the complexity is a big barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's more about an adoption side
of things that I think part of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: that growers do things that they do is
because it fits within their job as a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have limitations in terms of
their labor, their machinery, their land
[SPEAKER_00]: and their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more complex the system is,
the more management it's gonna take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would require more people doing
it or more time in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with like the machinery aspect,
if you do need specialized machinery to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest from one of these systems in an
efficient manner, then you're asking the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer to go buy another piece of
equipment, which can be incredibly costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the simplification of agricultural
systems is really at multiple levels to I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, it enables us to grow a lot of acres
in using a lot of the same machinery and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the same methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you step outside of that,
the extra effort to step outside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit much for a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're way past time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would encourage anybody who's got
some additional questions maybe to reach
[SPEAKER_04]: out to Eugene directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, Eugene, thanks for,
that was a really nice talk covering a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of, and there's a lot more behind all of
that, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again to all of you who hung in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
