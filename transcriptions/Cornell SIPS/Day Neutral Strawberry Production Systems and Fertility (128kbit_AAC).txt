[SPEAKER_01]: The first speaker of the day, Mr. Simon
Parand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon Parand is owner of Nova Fruit,
a strawberry and raspberry plant nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: located in Quebec that specializes in plug
and tray plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He regularly visits producers and
researchers abroad to adopt the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and transfer them to industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon is very much involved at all levels
of the production chain from breeding to
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing of fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is a member of several committees
and working groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is currently president of the North
American Strawberry Growers Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's hosting this webinar series,
and sits on the coordinating board of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec Strawberry Grower Association in
order to participate in the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sector and to make sure that the
technological developments in the company
[SPEAKER_01]: match the market's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you very much, Cady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very impressed with your good French
pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do the same in English then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very pleased to be part of this
Dana-Charles Strawberry Production
[SPEAKER_00]: webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kinds of interactive web events
sounds really new to us, but will become a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard definitely in the years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never replace any personal
meetings or the friendly relations that we
[SPEAKER_00]: share during congresses and conferences,
but it really has the advantage of putting
[SPEAKER_00]: together people that live far away from
each other on the same network to discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the topic I will approach today is
growing systems used for Dana-Charles
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will first shortly explain how
Dana-Charles are developing in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America among different climates and among
other growing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will discuss the different
production scheme used in the northeast of
[SPEAKER_00]: our continent to make Dana-Charles
production complementary and profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: with bare roots or plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, North America is a very vast
continent with a lot of climatic zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately for us, strawberries are
known among the most adaptable cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that will fit well in the most
various conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, acreages of strawberries are grown all
over the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data you see on this slide are from
different sources and different years of
[SPEAKER_00]: reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my numbers might not be all up to
date, but I just want to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general portrait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see here some of the most
important productions site in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America illustrated here with red circles
which are proportional to the acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern Canada is a big player over 10,000
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about the same in the north and
mid-east of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is more than 7,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now it's close to 10,000 in the
very south concentrated around Tampa in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California has close to 40,000 acres
spread over the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, on the following slide, instead of
acreage, you can see the average yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: each region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the scheme is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explain this difference, let me remind
you a few basics of physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really important that you all
understand this before we go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that strawberry is a very
adaptable species, and it is the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why it is so fascinating to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can crop the same plants in different
environment, and they will react in a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people don't really know why
summer-bearing strawberries are called
[SPEAKER_00]: short-day varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is because summer-bearing varieties
build flower buds in the crowns during the
[SPEAKER_00]: short days in fall, and those flowers will
come out and bear fruit only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it is a combination of short days and
cool climate that will induce flower bud
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation in short days cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the north, this process takes place in
the fall, and the plants bear fruit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, under lower latitudes,
like in Florida, growing conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: good all winter long, while the day land
stays short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, even the short-day varieties that
normally crops only three, four weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the north, they will give a continuous
supply of fruit over four or five months
[SPEAKER_00]: in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, this is for the short-day types.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, day-neutral varieties
will grow flower bud even when the days
[SPEAKER_00]: are long and temperatures are warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then even in northern latitudes,
they will give a continuous production all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the summer season, therefore
stretching the picking season from one
[SPEAKER_00]: month to five months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get back again a few slides and
have a second look at acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then let me show you again the average
yield that is increasing as you go south,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because, as I explained,
of a longer picking season, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: fasten your seat belt, total yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, California and Florida take most of
the screen, and they grow an enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of North American strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because their season is longer and
their yields are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will always remember a conference given
by Tom Julien from Driscoll at the NASGA
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress, who told us that the only way
the north could survive California's
[SPEAKER_00]: competition is by adopting new growing
systems that will stretch the season and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pointed out day-neutral varieties
as the most obvious option in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: the international trends at our latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantage we have in the north
is that many of the commercial day-neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, actually available,
do not support well intense heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting continuous summer production
to areas where the summers are not too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, meaning in northern latitudes or at
high altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will get into the more technical
part of my speech, and I will use Quebec's
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry grower system as a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all the dates and yields that I will
show are for a humid continental climate
[SPEAKER_00]: at latitude 48 degrees north.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Quebec, day-neutral strawberries occupy
around 20 percent of our strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 40 years ago, California and
Florida growers adopted a new growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system on raised bed covered with plastic
mulch and drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 30 years ago, North Carolina
growers followed introducing new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: types and varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty years ago, the northern growers
also started to do the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: day-neutral varieties, and they adapted
the system to their condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day-neutrals grown in the northeast
are grown on plastic culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not seem to be profitable to grow
day-neutrals in the traditional matted row
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic culture system will increase
yield, give a better fruit size,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase quality, a better uniformity,
efficiency, a season extension,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a better reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the east coast, the growers all use the
same suppliers for plastic culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: material, and mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the general specifications are
pretty much standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go rapidly to the most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we use a black plastic mulch from 0.9
to 1.25 mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This depends on the duration of the crop
mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer, the thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bed height is from 8 to 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will depend on the type of soil and
the bed shaper we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the higher is the better with
better drainage, more heat, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, the standard is more around 10
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bed width is from 20 to 30 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distance between the beds is from 48
to 60 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really depends on the bedding
equipment you will use, and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the distance between the
tractor wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance between the plants is 12 inches,
and distance between the row is from 12 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 inches on the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This depends on the bed size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remember that the plant must
keep at least 6 inches from the bed
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder, so fruit don't lay on the ground
and don't get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the density is between 15,000
and 22,000 plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will depend on all the other
distances stated above, but mostly the
[SPEAKER_00]: distances between rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, about half of nitrogen and
potash with all the phosphorous and
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients are applied broadcast
before shaping the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half of nitrogen and potash is
applied through drip irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think John will probably explain
this a lot more about that later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinklers are used for plant
establishment and for frost protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Row covers are also widely used for frost
protection and for season extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now I want to give you a brief
overview of the different growing system
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use to stretch our picking season
in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those next results and slides come from a
very innovative grower in Quebec called
[SPEAKER_00]: David Lemireux from Ferme Gagnon,
who has been very kind to share this
[SPEAKER_00]: information with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grower is located in the middle range
climate of the province and is often
[SPEAKER_00]: considered by his peer as our barometer
for picking season and average yield
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you represent the average between the
coolest and the warmest growing zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, well, I'm sorry here,
the slides title are in French.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't change them, but I'm sure
you will understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top graphic, for all the following
graphic, you will have the trends in
[SPEAKER_00]: prices on our local market, which you can
see is greatly linked with the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of fruits on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is on the left, the price for a
10-pound box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom graph, you will see how
we are using different systems to fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizontally, you have the picking dates
from June to October, and vertically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the yield that is picked per week
of harvest from each hectare of field.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this first slide, you can see prices on
the top graph and yields on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, in blue for the matadero system and
in red for the day-neutral system that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use with bare root plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the last few years,
we've added a lot, many new growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in light blue, more recently,
we had a jewel plug plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, and this is our subject,
we added day-neutral varieties using plug
[SPEAKER_00]: plants shown by the purple line instead of
the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugs of Seascape give a very early crop,
followed by a continuous picking all
[SPEAKER_00]: through October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, there are basically two ways of
growing day-neutrals in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the plant type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular system is to plant during
springtime with bare root dormant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the alternative system is to plant
late summer with plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in Quebec, the spring planted bare
roots are used on 80% of the acreage,
[SPEAKER_00]: while plugs are used on 20% of the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quebec growers are annually putting in the
ground 8 million plants of Seascape and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other day-neutrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bare root dormant plants have been the
standard plight for many years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: matadero and plasticulture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are grown for a full season in the
nursery field, dug in the late fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kept in the cooler during winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very adaptable and provide many
opportunities to use in different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system, as well as being relatively cheap
compared to other plant types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugs are runner tips that have been
rooted in peat-based media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also called misted tips in other
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are rooted in the nurseries in July
and planted in the field late August in
[SPEAKER_00]: Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug plants cost at least double the price
of bare roots, so it is a more risky
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but they also give an earlier
production, better fruit quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can, to some extent, be planted
mechanically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come back to the bare root,
and let me describe the spring planting
[SPEAKER_00]: system with bare roots that we use to grow
day-neutrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fields are treated as an annual
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as possible in April, the first
thing that growers do is shape their bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: lay plastic, and put the bare roots in the
ground, as you can see on this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it looked like a few days
after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are removed during four to six
weeks to help the plant build up a good
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf canopy that will support the summer
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are too weak at the
beginning of the harvest in July,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will lag behind all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always try to keep in mind marketing
consideration, and the fruits from those
[SPEAKER_00]: first flowers would be harvested at the
end of June when the prices are at their
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decision for us is easy to make,
and we cut the flowers until mid-June,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is to support a stronger crop
that will last until fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a good plant balance is maintained and
the crop is kept free of pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit production can last until the end of
October and even a little later in
[SPEAKER_00]: November with the use of row covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers are picking, in average,
25,000 pounds per acre on day-neutrals,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 1.3 pounds per plant, making this
system among the most productive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: North.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of cost and risk are
involved into this business, making it
[SPEAKER_00]: very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the profitability is based on one
single season, so it can easily become an
[SPEAKER_00]: economical disaster if something goes
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: An infestation of spider mites,
tarnished plant bugs, or even powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: meals you can greatly affect the crop
quality and yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bare-root day-neutral fields
are overwintered to give an early spring
[SPEAKER_00]: crop the following spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the yields were low during the first
year, it can still give a good second
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in ornate conditions,
a planting that has given 25,000 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: per acre the first year will have very big
and ramified plants, and those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to give small fruit of lesser quality
the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system of holding seascape plants for
a second year is well known by the buyers
[SPEAKER_00]: here, who state that we should not start
our picking season with such a low-quality
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is partly as an answer to that demand
that strawberry growers have started to
[SPEAKER_00]: use plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last five years, an increasing
proportion of day-neutral plantings in
[SPEAKER_00]: Quebec have been done with plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, more than 20% of day-neutral
plantings in our province are done with
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs, and it is still increasing every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugs are planted late August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants are grown late in the fall
under a row cover, and they are in perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions to build up those flower buds
that will give a very early quality spring
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plugs, the flowers don't need to be
cut, like with dormant plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because plugs are already well established
since the previous fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a very early June crop of
about 15,000 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see the difference in the
cropping pattern between bare root and
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the plug harvest is very
early and gives us a very good premium
[SPEAKER_00]: price for the first week of picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side for 2008, plugs have been
more productive than bare root by only
[SPEAKER_00]: 10%, but we often reach 20% to 25%
increase in yield with plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we need to consider that plugs
are two to three times more expensive than
[SPEAKER_00]: bare roots, and that there is a real risk
of winter damage on the plug that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with with the spring
plantings that are treated as an annual
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you know the general pattern,
let me show you a few things about plugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have discovered recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantages with late plantings
is that you can manipulate those plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways, depending on what you are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the first scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what will happen if we put the
plugs in the ground in September,
[SPEAKER_00]: so late planting, and if we don't push
them too hard in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following spring, this is what you
will get.
[SPEAKER_00]: These late planted plugs will give a very
early crop of high quality fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spring yield, however, will be lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be less than 10,000 pounds,
10,000 pounds per acre, but after a three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four week gap, the plants will come back
with a very heavy production in August and
[SPEAKER_00]: September, which is almost as good as with
bare root plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second scenario with the red
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if we push the plant as much as we
can during the planting year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we plant early in August,
we put the row covers early, we fertilize
[SPEAKER_00]: and water a lot in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will tend to give a very strong plant
in the spring that will crop a little
[SPEAKER_00]: later than the late planting, but that
will give a very heavy spring crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can range from 12,000 pounds to
sometime more than 15,000 pounds per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: with seascape in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it seems that we cannot cheat the
plant and that there is a maximum yield
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for a certain variety in a
certain field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this graph, both systems have
given the same total of 24 tons per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare, in this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens most of the time is that
after the heavy spring crop in early June,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are getting tired and the late
summer yields are always lower than with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bare root plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduction in harvest gets even worse
in situation where the spring yield is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher and where the climate is warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end, you more or less get the
same yield with the early planting than
[SPEAKER_00]: with the late planting, but the picking
are staggered differently over the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to come back to the slides
I've shown earlier from a Quebec grower
[SPEAKER_00]: called David Lemire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know that we can manipulate
the plants, this very ingenious grower
[SPEAKER_00]: started figuring out how we could fill the
gap between short days and day neutrals in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has experimented different techniques
to find out that if we leave just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers in the spring for a very early
crop, and if we cut all the flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out during the last three weeks of
May, we can this way bring the gap earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: in June and come back later on in July
with a better production than if we would
[SPEAKER_00]: leave all the flowers on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it will give.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flower management treatment gives
this brown curve that fits right when we
[SPEAKER_00]: need more fruits and when the prices are
at their highest range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, we now can pick
strawberries on a regular base all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: from June to October by managing the
different growing systems and plant types.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you already know, there are
many developments in Europe concerning
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate production, high tunnels,
and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day neutrals are grown in many countries
as UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trend is to cover the crops with high
tunnels and with greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As day neutral varieties benefit a lot
from this protection and from a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: picking season, in some countries,
almost 100% of day neutrals are grown
[SPEAKER_00]: under protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrate production on hanging gutters
has also become very popular, and most
[SPEAKER_00]: European breeding programs on day neutrals
are developing varieties for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not get into details today because
this would make another conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just want you to realize that much
is to come with day neutral varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are just at the beginning of a
major revolution for northern growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often show this sentence in conference,
the sentence I heard from Peter Vincent in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty years ago, we had 20 different
varieties in one growing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have 20 ways of growing the same
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really reflects well the trend of
growing or following with day neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wish to have more details,
I invite you to visit our website at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .novafruit.ca where you can find all the
different graphs and the different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: systems we are using here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plug plant nursery, which you can see
here, is located southeast of Montreal in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to grow the best strawberry
plugs in the northeast and supply this new
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank you very much for
your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kay would like to know when would the June
bearing plants be producing in your
[SPEAKER_01]: climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well there is a difference of about
10 days from the south of Montreal to the
[SPEAKER_00]: east of Quebec City, but let's take David
Lemire as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will normally start to pick the
earliest planting by the latest days of
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, the clary used as plug
plants will be picked like the 25th of
[SPEAKER_00]: May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the jewel as plug plant will be
picked from the 5th of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the bare root short
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I need to talk about the seascape
also that will normally be picked between
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1st and the 5th of May if used as a
plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the bare root
plantings on plastic that will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick around the 10th of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the matadro system
between the 15th and the 20th of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into some of the programit
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another system that I haven't
talked about, but we get small yields from
[SPEAKER_00]: programit crop by the first days of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from about mid-July we get into
the day neutrals, both plugs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back for a second production and
bare roots that are coming up with their
[SPEAKER_00]: first production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, it's a bit confusing but there's
a lot of system that we use now to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: our growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Laura McDermott would like to know,
do the early seascape fruit compete well
[SPEAKER_01]: with the traditional June bearers like
jewel in terms of flavor and customer
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for seascape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we are talking about the seascapes
that are held for a second year,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, the quality is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit size is lower, the shelf life is
lower, the taste is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: While with young plantings as with plug
plants or also with bare roots but that
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't produced a lot on the first year,
then we can get a very good quality early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens normally with seascape is
that we get a lower quality during the
[SPEAKER_00]: warmest period of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in July when temperatures are very
warm, the quality can decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early in June and later on in August,
with seascape, here we can get a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality fruit that can compete with jewel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marzman Glienicki from Poland would like
to know about the winter hardiness with
[SPEAKER_01]: day neutrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, this is another very good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why we have such a bad
quality and such bad results with
[SPEAKER_00]: overwintered seascape or albion or any
other of the day neutral that we grow here
[SPEAKER_00]: is because of winter damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants normally in the spring are
kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They push out a lot of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have a lot of good leaf
coverage or good leaf canopy to support
[SPEAKER_00]: those fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we get a low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you need to remember with winter
hardiness is that the older the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weaker it will be to go through
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with old plantings, we get those winter
damage while when we work with plug plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are planted in August with very young
tissue and very young plants that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in the same summer, then winter
resistance becomes very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we almost never see winter damage on
seascape plugs while we most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: see winter damage on the bare root
plantings that are overwintered for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to use row covers on the
plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the areas where the snow coverage
is not very good, we also use fences in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that each 10 or 15 rows we'll
put the fence all across the field just to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate more snow during the winter
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, are there any other questions for
Simone?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have a chance to ask more at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Kevin comes with a nice question
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is there not more albion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in Ontario, albion has taken a
lot of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about the bare root plants,
we have a very good quality crop with
[SPEAKER_00]: albion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that we pick it very
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start to pick it, let's say by
mid-August, we'll start to have good yield
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the season is so short afterward that
we just cannot pick the yield out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So albion is not used in our climate with
bare root plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plug plants, the scheme is a bit
different because then the establishment
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant is done in the fall and we
start to pick early in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth that albion needs to start
production, it's considered as a weak day
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs a lot more time than seascape
to get established and to start a good
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring with plug plants,
we start to pick with albion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if the climate stays cool,
seascape still gives better yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: albion as plug plant also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, over the last four years,
I would say that in the warmest region of
[SPEAKER_00]: Quebec, two years out of four,
seascape still has been better than albion
[SPEAKER_00]: as plug plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the coolest place of Quebec,
in the coolest areas, let's say that one
[SPEAKER_00]: year out of four, albion has been better
than seascape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not adopted yet as a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit quality is wonderful,
but we just cannot pick the yield out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it with both types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian McGregor would like to know what
thickness of row cover you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, another good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thrown away all the row covers
under 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 19 gram per square meter row covers
are not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use row covers between 30 and 40 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What growers are considering now is the
durability of those row covers versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that investing in heavier
row covers like the 42 grams or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 gram or double layer of 40 grams gives
us a longer durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, 30 to 40 grams per square meter
would be the average in the row covers
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Simon will be back with us again at
the end to answer more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take this one more from Rajmund.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a comment he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: He agrees with Simon about the weight on
albion that the fruits are too late and
[SPEAKER_01]: the yield is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Simon, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please stay with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I want to introduce to you our
second speaker, Mr. John Zanstra.
[SPEAKER_01]: John completed his Bachelor of Science
degree in agriculture and Master of
[SPEAKER_01]: Science at the University of Guelph and
has been with the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Guelph-Ridgetown campus since 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's responsible for conducting cropping
systems research on fruit and vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: crops in southwestern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: John is presently the coordinator of the
agriculture and horticulture diploma
[SPEAKER_01]: programs at Ridgetown campus and also
teaches courses in fruit and vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: crop management.
[SPEAKER_01]: He manages the Cedar Springs Fruit
Research Station, which is located on the
[SPEAKER_01]: north shore of Lake Erie, 15 kilometers
east of the town of Blenheim.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main focus in the fruit research
program for the past few years is the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of cropping systems for day
neutral strawberries, including high
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_01]: John?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a radio celebrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to reflect what Simon said,
it's an interesting way to bring this
[SPEAKER_03]: information across.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just update again our add to what
you included.
[SPEAKER_03]: The site that we're working on is kind of
midway between London and Windsor,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're about an hour and a half to the
east of Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So north shore Lake Erie, a warmer
production area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a fair bit of trouble with
production during the hotter part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: summer, and I'll allude to that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to do is just score a
little bit of background why we're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in irrigation, especially in a
day neutral system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk a little bit about your irrigation
because you have to have a good handle on
[SPEAKER_03]: your irrigation system if you're going to
be adding fertilizer through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few comments on fertilizer selection,
micronutrients, and then considerations
[SPEAKER_03]: and rates and some of the techniques that
we use to put fertilizer in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wanted to go over a little bit of
our current research that we're doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: then just finish off some micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that I've got a comment about
speaking louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everybody able to hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we good for you there, Kathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: John, no, you need to be louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I've got this thing cranked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, we will try to talk a little
bit louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so why fertigate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got a day neutral system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got raised beds and plastic and a
drip tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not put fertigation in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a logical extension of a typical day
neutral production system relative to or
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to, say, putting everything on
this dry fertilizer in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the published benefits of
fertigation and many of these will apply
[SPEAKER_03]: to a strawberry system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed the crop as it needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit being done at this
point in terms of targeting different
[SPEAKER_03]: rates of fertility based on plant
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's some work in Europe
where they're actually targeting the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertility based on, say, the flower
development of the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's something we can move ahead with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it gives you a lot of flexibility in
terms of feeding the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're putting the nutrition right where
the plant needs it in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suggesting savings of upwards of,
let's say, 20%, 30% in terms of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're getting it to the plant
when it needs it in a form that's quite
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got some savings there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got product savings,
possible labor, machinery, fuel savings
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're not having to go through
the field and do it mechanically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, your leaching potential isn't
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You manage where it goes through your
irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be put on early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're working with the weather
to try and keep it where it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're able to work with that a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's some of the focus that we've
been working on as well, looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: application efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to talk a little bit about
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't talk about fertigation without
knowing your irrigation system well and
[SPEAKER_03]: making it as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to irrigate well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to make sure that the
irrigation is put on uniformly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm taking a quote out of one of the
references that I used, a booklet titled
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the comment there is distribution of
fertigation can't be better than the
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're carrying one with the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to make sure you're putting it
in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to give the plants adequate
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you certainly want to make sure that
you're getting it into the zone where the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry is going to take it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're flushing it all through,
you're not doing a very good job of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having things consistent in terms of
your irrigation approach is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things you want to consider when you're
irrigating for one, weather conditions,
[SPEAKER_03]: evapotranspiration, how much is being used
by the plant, how much is being released
[SPEAKER_03]: by the soil, how much irrigation water
needs to go back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to consider the maturity of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: As it gets bigger, as it starts to hang a
crop, as the plant increases in size,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to affect the amount of water
that needs to be put back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've not ferticated or irrigated
strawberries extensively and you've worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with other types of crops before,
it's not a straight crossover.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to consider the plant,
the size of the plant again, the leaf area
[SPEAKER_03]: that's involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of considerations need to be put
into place when you're developing an
[SPEAKER_03]: effective irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also need to be familiar with your
soil, how much water is available to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to know the rooting depth of
your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to consider how able that plant
is to extract the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for strawberries, some suggestions in
the literature indicate that strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: will root up to about 60 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a bit extreme, especially
in the sites that we're on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting it that deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, get some idea of the effective
area that the plant is rooting into.
[SPEAKER_03]: A shovel would be an easy way to confirm
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just make sure that when you're
putting the water on, which is carrying
[SPEAKER_03]: the fertilizer, that you're not moving it
past the zone or you're not putting on
[SPEAKER_03]: enough and not getting into the zone of
the roots of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the parameters I talked about
earlier, the evapotranspiration,
[SPEAKER_03]: the rooting depth, the water holding
capacity of the plant, you can plug these
[SPEAKER_03]: into models and calculate how much water
needs to be added and when it needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: These models are quite effective and I've
used a number of them in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get quite accurate in terms of
replacing the water that's being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of running a spreadsheet and
topping up at the end of the day or every
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use monitoring equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've listed a few things here,
tensiometers, TDRs, things that are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting more affordable and growers might
be able to use and are somewhat are fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: reproducible in terms of the numbers that
they give you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, even running irrigation,
going out and digging and finding out
[SPEAKER_03]: where it is just to make sure that you're
putting it in the zone where it needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with these monitoring techniques or
this monitoring equipment you can easily
[SPEAKER_03]: see when that band of water comes through.
[SPEAKER_03]: They respond fairly quickly to irrigation
water being added and that way keep track
[SPEAKER_03]: of where the water is going and
effectively where your irrigation is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people don't really realize a lot
of the time how far water will move.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a table that I picked out of,
again, one of the booklets that I used as
[SPEAKER_03]: a reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it does is relates soil texture and
moisture content of the soil to the depth
[SPEAKER_03]: that the water will go if you're,
say, putting an inch of water on a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of flipping here between
imperial and metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies, but I didn't have time to
convert this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, if you've got,
say, a sandy loam soil and it's at a 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: water holding capacity, if you put an inch
of water on that, that water will soak
[SPEAKER_03]: down about 16 inches into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's moving a fair distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're dealing with a strawberry
crop, you might be moving somewhat out of
[SPEAKER_03]: where that plant is actually able to pick
up that fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to be aware of that and,
again, keep that in mind whenever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: moving and putting water on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fertilization or fertilizer
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a wide range of products that you
can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the simplest thing is just to
go get some fertilizer that you would put
[SPEAKER_03]: on the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more complicated than
getting a mixture, but it certainly is
[SPEAKER_03]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few cautions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using, say, granular fertilizer,
you always need to do a test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always need to do a combination of
what you're putting on, do a jar test,
[SPEAKER_03]: use the actual irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, if you're using,
say, phosphate fertilizers and you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: other formulations of calcium in it or if
your water is extremely hard and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in, say, phosphate or sulfate
compounds, you can get precipitates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So put it in a jar, use the actual
irrigation water, mix it up, let it sit
[SPEAKER_03]: there for a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's any type of precipitate or
gunk in the water, you won't want to go
[SPEAKER_03]: over the field with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to plug up your emitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using prepared formulations
intended for fertigation or liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers, you're usually fairly safe
and it's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is always that temptation or
that opportunity to use commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers or granulars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have to keep in mind the
solubility of these fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're usually quite soluble,
but there are tables and charts out there
[SPEAKER_03]: that give you information on the relative
solubilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, to keep in mind, say,
if you're using ammonium nitrate type
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers, they vary in their solubility
depending on the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate are a
couple of examples where that will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be familiar with what you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure it is quite soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other approach then is just to get
regular pre-made fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to give a bit of information or just
to review some of the macronutrients and
[SPEAKER_03]: the way they move in solution and the way
they're taken up by the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: forms of nitrogen are different in terms
of plant response and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: information around that is helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plants normally take up nitrogen as
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small amounts are taken up as ammonium
directly by the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitrate is the concern in terms of
leaching out of the soil volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a negatively charged ion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not held by the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It moves readily in the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll leach quite easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ammonium, on the other hand, is positively
charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't move very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's held quite well by the soil,
doesn't move far in the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's readily converted to nitrates by
soil organisms and then the plant will
[SPEAKER_03]: take it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you do put a lot of ammonium on,
it does get converted eventually depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on the soil and soil temperatures and
such.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is giving you a bit of a buffer
there because it does stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't move around fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now feeding with high levels of either
form in a fertigation system can affect
[SPEAKER_03]: the uptake of other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's generally recommended that you have a
balance of the two in your fertigation
[SPEAKER_03]: program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're leaning towards heavy levels
of nitrate or heavy levels of ammonium,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can upset other nutrients in terms of
their uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can interfere with other metabolic
processes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So generally, they recommend that you use
a fairly good mixture of the two,
[SPEAKER_03]: some actual figures that I've come across
are no more than 50% ammonium,
[SPEAKER_03]: no more than 60% nitrate in a mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do find examples in the literature
where they're looking specifically at
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries and looking at different
ratios of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are suggestions that
strawberries prefer nitrate over ammonium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've even heard suggestions that one
over the other will promote vegetative
[SPEAKER_03]: growth more than reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may want to use that early in the
season to enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But typically, a mixture of the two is
good if not moving too far in one
[SPEAKER_03]: direction or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few comments on phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil phosphorus as a whole is not terribly
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slowly mineralized and released to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tends to bind fairly tightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Availability is best at, say, between six
and seven soil pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, pre-plant incorporation is more
economical when you're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular strawberry crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the considerations there,
when you're transplanting, you want it to
[SPEAKER_03]: be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless you've got your irrigation in
place and you've started to put some
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphate down, it's likely a good idea to
have enough in the soil when the plants go
[SPEAKER_03]: in either as a plug or as a bare root
plant just to stimulate root development,
[SPEAKER_03]: get the roots going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put some in as a transplant
solution, it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to try and rely on a fertigation
system to put it all there might not be
[SPEAKER_03]: the most effective way.
[SPEAKER_03]: With long-season crops like strawberries,
some suggest it might be useful to add a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit through the fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in general, it's put down all
pre-plant and then it's available to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants don't really require an awful lot
of it relative to nitrogen or potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pre-plant incorporation of most of it
is usually a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potash as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our soils have adequate potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really only a small amount that's
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this equilibrium in the soil
between fixed potash and available potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It too, a fair portion of it, is often
pre-plant incorporated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't move far in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's often well available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we often like to add a little bit
through the fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fruit quality issues associated
with extra potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, again, something that we tend to
put a little bit in the fertigation
[SPEAKER_03]: solution just to make sure that enough is
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough is available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, it's recognized that
even though the soil has a lot there,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the amount that is available to a
plant at any given time just isn't enough
[SPEAKER_03]: to provide adequate growth and
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll add a little bit to the
fertigation solution as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're starting to fertigate,
obviously the first thing you want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: is test your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is adequate amounts there,
you may not want to add any more through
[SPEAKER_03]: the fertigation solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure you know what is
there so you're not spending extra money
[SPEAKER_03]: putting material on that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure your soil pH is in a
range that provides optimum uptake of the
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and optimum growth for the
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on where you look and where
you're located, it can vary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally between six and a half and
say seven, two, seven, three is the pH
[SPEAKER_03]: range that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't see a lot of reference in the
literature about testing irrigation and
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it's a bad idea to do
that either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just to make sure that you don't
have any high levels of particular
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients in your water or to make sure
that you're not having to deal with really
[SPEAKER_03]: hard water or water where the pH is off
and it's going to mess up your nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So know what you're getting into and know
what your soil is like, know what your
[SPEAKER_03]: water quality is like, just to be able to
not have to worry about those issues and
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that you're in good shape there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the things to consider when you're
trying to determine the rates of
[SPEAKER_03]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I talked about how much is supplied by
the soil and the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, in terms of the soil, what your
previous crops are in terms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any residue there that's going to
be providing extra nitrogen or residual
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen in the soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind with strawberries as well
that if you're dealing with a crop that
[SPEAKER_03]: overwintered, usually early spring growth
in the strawberry, a lot of the nutrition
[SPEAKER_03]: comes from the plant itself, the crown of
the plant, at least for the first few
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks of growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may not have to feed it quite as
heavy at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the plant requires the nutrient,
well, again, that's still not terribly
[SPEAKER_03]: clear with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not really advanced in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's hopefully something that'll come
along down the line so we can more
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively feed the plant at particular
areas when it's looking for nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what rates do I use?
[SPEAKER_03]: P and K, again, just general rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a real big growth response
in terms of strawberry development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitrogen is one we concern ourselves with
most, depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really can't give any specific
recommendations, obviously, but you need
[SPEAKER_03]: to consider, again, what your soil is
like, where you're growing, what your
[SPEAKER_03]: seasonal length is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you survey the literature, particularly
in North America, we see rates anywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: from no response to additional nitrogen
upwards of three quarters of a kilo of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen per hectare per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, soil type will have a big effect
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, it's felt that growers use
more than they really need.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be seen as an insurance policy,
but a lot of the time, you really don't
[SPEAKER_03]: need to put on as much as you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're getting more than you need,
either you run the risk of losing it
[SPEAKER_03]: through leaching in the soil, but also a
big lush plant isn't a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's well documented that, say,
botrytis and thoracnose incidence is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's higher if you've got high nitrogen
rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fruit quality is poor, storage is poor,
so there are a lot of drawbacks to having
[SPEAKER_03]: too much nitrogen in your fritigation as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a talk a few days ago,
and this fellow was talking about grape
[SPEAKER_03]: production, and his comment there was,
we're not wood growers, we're fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, and I guess you could sort of see
the same with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a certain size of plant,
but too much nitrogen, in particular,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you're growing a lot of extra leaf
there, and it may not be necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may cause you more trouble than you
actually are, more problems than benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of application of fritigation,
you want to be below a 1% solution in your
[SPEAKER_03]: final mixture, so you make up your stock
solution, and there's a number of ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: get it into the irrigation lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sources say upwards of 5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others are more cautious and say,
really don't want more than 1%,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the concern is damage to the roots,
just shoving too much in there and causing
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: It varies, again, with the formulation,
the electroconductivity of the particular
[SPEAKER_03]: formulation and what type of plant you're
dealing with, but it is a good guideline
[SPEAKER_03]: to go by, so our solutions never are more
than 1%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on how quickly you put them on
as well, but again, it's a good guideline
[SPEAKER_03]: to prevent any problems in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to get our applications of
fritigation on fairly quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: so what we'll do is we prime the system,
make sure everything's running well,
[SPEAKER_03]: get water through all the drip tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to get our fritigation on within a
half an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, they suggest within a half to
an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go longer than that
because you tend to dilute things,
[SPEAKER_03]: and again, you want to keep it in that
zone of use by the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when it's all done, we'll flush the
system again for another 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're concerned with there is
uniformity across the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got rolling topography,
you may get more settling in the low
[SPEAKER_03]: areas, so you just want to make sure that
the uniformity of application is
[SPEAKER_03]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll flush afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to work well, and then you keep
track of your soil moisture and add more
[SPEAKER_03]: if you need to, but the actual fritigation
application tends to be fairly short.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also base what you put on in terms
of what the plant uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a few sources on the internet,
actually, which suggest how much the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry plant uses over a cropping
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one of them, I should say,
really indicated what the size of the crop
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the three, two were fairly close in
terms of how much the crop actually used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, for example, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this 30-ton crop, there was kind of a
range, but anywhere between 57 and 78
[SPEAKER_03]: kilos per hectare is taken up by the fruit
and the plant to produce that 30-ton crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phosphorus is fairly low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potash is somewhere within that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sources that I found ranged anywhere
from 63 to 92, magnesium 8 to 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get an idea from that what you
need to be adding to your plant if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in just replacing what is used
by the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also need to consider what is coming
out of the soil itself, what is being
[SPEAKER_03]: mineralized, and also what is being
remobilized in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the sorts of numbers that are
actually being used to produce this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, the nitrogen levels are in
fairly good agreement with what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: finding in the fertigation work that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, just an idea of what's being taken
up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last column is just a breakdown of
what percentage the fruit is using
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to what percentage of that
nutrient is going into the plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: maintaining the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to overview some of the work that
we're doing, we've been looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: fertigation over a number of years in
Ontario simply because we don't have local
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations or base recommendations on
other locations in North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got two production sites,
one in the Cedar Springs Station where we
[SPEAKER_03]: are and one at the Simcoe Research
Station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our soil is fairly loamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a pH of where we want at 6.6.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic matter of about 3.5 or 3.3 percent
compared to a coarse sandy soil on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Simcoe site.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did on these locations is we're
both grew seascape at both sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our populations were a little bit lower at
Cedar Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a range of nitrogen rates anywhere
from zero to 150 kilos per hectare over
[SPEAKER_03]: the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would usually start in mid-May and run
to about mid-October in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another treatment was timing where we
would start our fertigation program later
[SPEAKER_03]: in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would put on 75 kilos but we would
start it in later July so we would load
[SPEAKER_03]: the back end of the season more with the
nitrogen and then lastly we had a 75 kilo
[SPEAKER_03]: per hectare treatment but we would also
put extra potash with it to see if there
[SPEAKER_03]: was any effect in respect to that
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Simcoe it was a smaller trial because
it's a ways away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only used three rates of nitrogen,
same variety, the seascape variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case a commercial grower came in
and put the beds in so our populations
[SPEAKER_03]: were a little bit higher and we also had a
white plastic on that site which we find
[SPEAKER_03]: is a little bit better but we started with
black and cedar springs so we continued
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have three rates of nitrogen in
Simcoe and we also had the timing
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment so 75 kilos per hectare but
beginning a little later in the season so
[SPEAKER_03]: the applications were a little bit larger
at every given time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put them on with a dosimatic which is a
commercial diluter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can certainly be used in a field
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We determined our rates based on total
land area not the area under plastic just
[SPEAKER_03]: to make the calculations easier and have
it relate to the growers better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked on a 17 week period so for
example our 75 kilos per hectare is about
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.4 kilos of nitrogen per week and I think
that's about 0.6 kilos per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started applications in mid-May,
finished in mid-October.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nitrogen source that we used is 28%
liquid which is a combination of urea and
[SPEAKER_03]: ammonium nitrate and in our potash
treatments we added a potassium nitrate
[SPEAKER_03]: and then topped it off with 20% to 28%
liquid just to give us our 75 kilos per
[SPEAKER_03]: hectare nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: In cedar springs we really had no
significant difference amongst treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what you're seeing here is our fall
crop so our planting system or production
[SPEAKER_03]: system that we follow is we plant in May,
we harvest say late July, early August
[SPEAKER_03]: through the fall and then we'll keep that
crop over the winter and we'll do a spring
[SPEAKER_03]: flush and so we'll start to harvest again
say mid-May and go to about maybe late
[SPEAKER_03]: June-July and that's what we mean by fall
and by spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fall crop year of planting and again on
a per year basis no statistical
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've put the three years together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not done the stats on this but you
can see there's not a huge response in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of increasing nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a bit of a trend increase when we
get up to say 25-75 kilos per hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I find interesting is we're seeing a
bit of a boost if we're putting on that
[SPEAKER_03]: fertility late so there seems to be a bit
of advantage at least in the first year
[SPEAKER_03]: the year of planting of putting more in
later in the season versus earlier in the
[SPEAKER_03]: season and the thought is just getting
that crop developed and feeding it later
[SPEAKER_03]: in the season to get it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the following year the
spring crop so this is the crop the year
[SPEAKER_03]: after it was planted again no real
response in terms of nitrogen rate as we
[SPEAKER_03]: go across from 0 to 25 to 75 and they're
even tending to decline as we get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: higher nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: No real benefit there of putting a late
crop in or sorry a late nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: application or loading it up late in the
season and we really don't see a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit at this point either of the high
potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairly similar to what our best
treatment is in terms of just the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen rates so we didn't see a huge
benefit in terms of adding that extra
[SPEAKER_03]: potash on this site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in Cedar Springs we've got this high
organic matter three and a half percent
[SPEAKER_03]: organic matter in some of our early season
soil tests we were finding that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: getting about 20 part per million of
nitrate available to the plant which they
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me equates to about 70 80 pounds of
actual nitrogen so we had a fairly good
[SPEAKER_03]: rate of nitrogen available to those plants
early on in the season which which may
[SPEAKER_03]: explain where we're not getting any
response to to applied nitrogen in our
[SPEAKER_03]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at Simcoe in our fall crop it's
on a coarser soil it's a sandier soil you
[SPEAKER_03]: can see on the top graph is our marketable
yield in response to nitrogen and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: see there's a fairly good response to to
increasing rates of nitrogen as we would
[SPEAKER_03]: expect and here again in in the fall in
the year of planting in our fall crop
[SPEAKER_03]: we're seeing a bit of a boost by putting
on the nitrogen having more put on later
[SPEAKER_03]: in the season versus evenly across the
entire production season.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at the spring crop in the same
planting again we're seeing this rate
[SPEAKER_03]: increase as we're going from zero upwards
to 125 kilos per hectare the the benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: of the laid-up applied nitrogen in terms
of marketable yield really isn't there
[SPEAKER_03]: similar to what we saw in Cedar Springs so
so seeing the same sort of trend there but
[SPEAKER_03]: but obviously on this coarse soil we're
seeing more of a response to nitrogen than
[SPEAKER_03]: we are on the on the loamier ground so so
here too we don't see a real response on
[SPEAKER_03]: the loams when we get into the sandier
soils there seems to be more of a response
[SPEAKER_03]: because likely the just the lack of or the
lower organic matter the the higher rate
[SPEAKER_03]: of of leaching if it's there so not
completely unexpected okay moving on to
[SPEAKER_03]: micronutrients a lot of a lot of people
try to sell sell you micronutrients my
[SPEAKER_03]: philosophy on that is unless you know
you've got a problem if you're soil is
[SPEAKER_03]: well maintained if your pH is good if
you've got good good healthy production
[SPEAKER_03]: practices I don't really see a use in that
my suggestion which I've heard from others
[SPEAKER_03]: is is if you want to get a baseline of
what micronutrients should be in your crop
[SPEAKER_03]: we do have recommendations in Ontario of
what the the level of nutrients nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: in the plant should be based on tissue
samples but if you want to know what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like on your own site go to an area in
your farm where you've got good production
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're happy with with how the
plants performing and they look healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: take some tissue samples send them to the
lab kind of get a baseline of what is in
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants at that particular location
and then if you run into trouble you could
[SPEAKER_03]: compare them to that you can see where
you're you're getting getting into trouble
[SPEAKER_03]: and and may explain some problems that
you're seeing if there are in fact
[SPEAKER_03]: micronutrient deficiencies there are
suggestions in the literature of high
[SPEAKER_03]: boron requirements we've not seen that on
our sites the only one that I'm really
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with is is is iron and Becky
Hughes who works for the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Guelph in our northern location regularly
adds foliar iron to her day neutrals
[SPEAKER_03]: because of because of the deficiency she's
got there on the clay but certainly not
[SPEAKER_03]: something that we've seen where we are
where we are in in our site this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: series of samples that I took early on
when we started working with day neutrals
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't really familiar with them this is
the the second year crop so this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: year after planting this is a seascape
crop at our cedar spring site we talk off
[SPEAKER_03]: about 19 and a half tons per hectare on on
this particular planting and we refer to
[SPEAKER_03]: it further gating with a complete blend
triple 20 and putting on about 0.6 kilo
[SPEAKER_03]: per hectare per day and we would put them
on once a week and so we were we were
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing some symptoms under our tunnels
this is the outside production where I was
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the samples from but we were seeing
some some symptoms that we weren't really
[SPEAKER_03]: sure well we're we're we weren't really
sure what was going on and so the concern
[SPEAKER_03]: was micronutrient so we started sampling
and we tried to get in every two weeks and
[SPEAKER_03]: and take fully expanded leaf recently
expanded leaf so they're fairly young and
[SPEAKER_03]: and analyze the petioles of them and in
the second column that's the recommended
[SPEAKER_03]: rates in Ontario we can see the dates as
we go across what our nutrient status was
[SPEAKER_03]: and the red the red numbers indicate where
we were falling below the Ontario
[SPEAKER_03]: recommended rates and you can see there's
a few cases where nitrogen was dipping a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit but certainly we weren't wildly
low in our rates potash again a little a
[SPEAKER_03]: few times midseason where we were getting
below the recommended rates but but not
[SPEAKER_03]: moving out in any any great degree so so
it really wasn't anything to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition and then we realized now that
was more heat stress on the plants than
[SPEAKER_03]: anything but it was just a nice way to to
kind of see where we're going what our
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient status was in particular the
microbes and and just managing them
[SPEAKER_03]: without putting any great effort on
microbes weren't seeing any big problems
[SPEAKER_03]: there and and and no big differences so
just some general comments to summarize
[SPEAKER_03]: the fertigation topic if you're new to it
start simple become comfortable with your
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation system and your your
fertigation systems again uniformity is
[SPEAKER_03]: important in putting the water down and
then when the fertility is carried along
[SPEAKER_03]: with it hopefully that will will follow
the same trend soil testing and tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: testing are good indications of of what's
available in the soil and what's getting
[SPEAKER_03]: into the plant and it'll it'll set up some
guidelines for you and in all cases make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure your record-keeping is good what
products you were using what rates were
[SPEAKER_03]: putting on if you were happy with the
condition of your plants if you think your
[SPEAKER_03]: yield potential was there you can always
go back and look at those and they give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a good indication of what was going on
as you move on you can refine them one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the questions I've got is whether or in
free bar more frequent smaller doses of
[SPEAKER_03]: fertility are applicable kind of thinking
in terms of vegetable transplant
[SPEAKER_03]: production where where daily applications
we find are more efficient and do then and
[SPEAKER_03]: say weekly applications applications based
on on plant growth is something I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that is up and coming and and might be
interesting but we don't think we really
[SPEAKER_03]: have the information on that yet
differences in variety on we wonder if
[SPEAKER_03]: albion just needs a little bit more to
push it along because it tends to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: little slower maturing assignment mention
but but also it tends to we think need a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit more in terms of growing a
plant and then just sat testing on the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm there are a number of instruments
where you can go into the field yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: and then test for different nutrients and
and whether that could be part of a
[SPEAKER_03]: fertigation program just to try and
maintain the quality and industry and
[SPEAKER_03]: status plant as you go through the season
okay that kind of concludes with a what I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to talk about I've just got a list
of some of the books and yeah the books
[SPEAKER_03]: that I used to put this together and there
were a number of research articles as well
[SPEAKER_03]: that that we looked at so so if you want
to look at them further so thank you for
[SPEAKER_01]: your time and yeah okay okay John thank
you very much there are some questions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the chat box the first one is from Rashman
Kuliki again he's wondering if the
[SPEAKER_01]: application of multi-microbial inocula as
a bio fertilizer could be more effective
[SPEAKER_03]: in plants growth promotion than humic acid
application oh I really have no experience
[SPEAKER_03]: with any of that yeah I've not at all
worked in that and I really didn't focus
[SPEAKER_03]: on that when I was reviewing the
literature so sorry I really don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: what to say in that respect as certainly
an interesting area looking at bio
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers but it isn't something that I
focused on in terms of this presentation
[SPEAKER_01]: okay Rod Elmstrand would like to know why
white plastic or black we're in a fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: warm production area so we prefer white it
it doesn't give us a good head start in
[SPEAKER_03]: the season but when we get into a warmer
part of the summers we notice a difference
[SPEAKER_03]: on on in terms of production and quality
so white is better black just gets too
[SPEAKER_03]: warm it just isn't a good situation for us
we want to we want to be able to cool the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants or grow them in a cooler
environment I was just joking with a
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic supplier a few days ago ideally
would be nice if we would have something
[SPEAKER_03]: that was black in the summer and then
started to fade and and turn white later
[SPEAKER_03]: in the year but the thought has been about
white washing and we've looked at these
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk type plastics as well but the basic
reason is is we're warm we want a cooler
[SPEAKER_03]: environment for our plants so so we use a
white plastic okay is wondering if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: any other research with white plastic
around the country or the world so if any
[SPEAKER_01]: of our other participants have some
comments on that please feel free to weigh
[SPEAKER_01]: in Rajman has one more question about once
again if the phy or the phosphite form of
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorus can be considered as a
fertilizer again not not familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: that form of fertilizer I assume again
this is in the in more of the bio for life
[SPEAKER_03]: approach but sorry not not not familiar
with that okay Kay is wondering how your
[SPEAKER_01]: spring yield results compared to Simon's
comments about the spring crop being poor
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon are you with us and does the second
year spring harvest happen in May when
[SPEAKER_03]: June bearing begins in mid-June um maybe
just like a start our in our area are you
[SPEAKER_03]: neutrals usually have a week or two a
benefit for earlier production than our
[SPEAKER_03]: day or than our June bears they just seem
to start off earlier so if we're comparing
[SPEAKER_03]: side by side day neutrals that were
planted the previous year their spring
[SPEAKER_03]: crop the following year tends to be
earlier than a an established June bearing
[SPEAKER_03]: crop just just the nature of the plant our
spring crop the year after planting also
[SPEAKER_03]: tends to be smaller the fruit size isn't
quite as big but we we do get a fair bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of crop in that second year so we're going
with a spring planted bare root plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: we would put in in May we'll start to crop
it again in July late July August
[SPEAKER_03]: September and as long as we can go the
second year you you tend to lose a bit on
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit size but we do get a fairly decent
crop in that second year once we get into
[SPEAKER_03]: the heat of the summer at this point we
usually abandon it because it's the crowns
[SPEAKER_03]: are getting big the plants are starting to
get tired we've tried different things to
[SPEAKER_03]: carry that crop further in that second
year we do have some growers in Ontario
[SPEAKER_03]: that that are able to do it successfully
but I'm not really sure what they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: but we're not able to win the location
that we're at another question is if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: better to apply micronutrients especially
boron as a foliar spray or soil
[SPEAKER_03]: application boron is easily applied as a
foliar I think it's a little less
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive putting it in the soil boron is
is tricky because you don't need an awful
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of it and and often talks to toxicity
symptoms maybe somewhat similar to to
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiency symptoms I've not seen
deficiency symptoms in our plots I've
[SPEAKER_03]: heard a lot of trouble with with people
getting a little carried away with it but
[SPEAKER_03]: either way it can be done but again I
think the the more effective way is is to
[SPEAKER_03]: put it on or sorry the more economical
ways to put it on as a soil application if
[SPEAKER_03]: you know there's a problem but but
certainly it's it's able to be put on
[SPEAKER_03]: through foliar sprays and it is effective
to do it that way okay and then I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: the last question was from John Brand
Stratter he's wondering if you've worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with calcium nitrate and if you could give
us some input on that I've not worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium nitrate it is one that that you
hear people using especially if they're if
[SPEAKER_03]: they're interested in getting more and
more calcium to the plant our soils are
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally very high in calcium so I'm not
at all concerned about calcium in the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant if you if your your irrigation is
timely and and consistent calcium uptake
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't usually an issue for us so no I have
not worked with it in particular we we've
[SPEAKER_03]: stuck with just the the liquid 28 percent
as our major nitrate or nitrogen source
[SPEAKER_01]: okay then does anyone have questions for
either Simone or John while we're waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to remind you that the last in
the mini series on day neutral
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries the last webinar will be next

[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe's from North Carolina State
University talking about diseases and
[SPEAKER_01]: their management and Dr. David Handley
from University of Maine talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: insect and mite management for day neutral
strawberries I want to thank Simone and
[SPEAKER_01]: John for their excellent presentations and
we'll take any questions that you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: in the meantime okay Michael Collins is
wondering if there you have any ideas for
[SPEAKER_03]: soluble organic fertilizers to use in drip
again no here you're you're asking the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong person I really I really don't I'm
not aware of what's available in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: organic fertilizers yeah it's really an
interesting market but I just don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: any experience in that in that area any
other questions
