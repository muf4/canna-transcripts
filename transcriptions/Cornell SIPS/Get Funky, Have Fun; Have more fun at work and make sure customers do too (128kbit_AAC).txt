[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk fast, be chirpy,
and funny, and deliver us right into
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that about right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep you awake right up to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some familiar faces, which is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get funky kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will introduce myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all of the things I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there might be some lies in
there, too, that I'm not no-nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I not no-nonsense or am I no-nonsense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm not no-nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a blogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written a gardening blog for 12
years, which in blogging is a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working in garden centers in my
20s after being a manager at Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like totally normal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Manager at Starbucks, quit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frappuccinos came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, screw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go water plants for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working in gardening since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very serious person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make no jokes at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mom, a Daisy Troop leader,
a Chicagoan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a columnist at Green Prophet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the Daisy Troop leader part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm humorless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tattoo of Falco pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're the nicest things I've
ever owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got the tattoo that was the nicest
thing I'd ever owned was two pairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: Falco pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had any quality tools in my life
until then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very bland and boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have terrible eyesight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you know everything about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So garden centers are my big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to every garden center I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could plan vacations around stopping at
garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I notice a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things that we're doing
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things that we're doing
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first thing is why garden centers are
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one who owns one or runs one often
runs one like it is retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those rules don't apply to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of customers don't really get how to
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: New customers don't really get how to shop
for plants or how to operate in a garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another Starbucks reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the first time you went to
Starbucks and you were like you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a friend to help you figure it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden centers are like that for new
gardeners and new shoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea where to get your wagon
or where to check out or how things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not like the grocery store or
Target or the drugstore or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just totally different rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really go, we don't really
try to help those new people at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this idea which is like a new
gardener start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's like the flashiest
display ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would totally kick this up a few
notches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a good representation of a
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a big fan of picking a night of
the month or a night of the week or a day
[SPEAKER_00]: of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is New Customer Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put out the banner, hey every Tuesday
new customers welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have extra special staff here to help
new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extra patient and extra smart
every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it's the same staff you always
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was funny you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get them t-shirts like we are the
special Tuesday extra caring sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: staff for new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it's just the same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Beginner's Day once or twice a month or
you can advertise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use social media which I know
everyone loves so much and they're praying
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about but your prayers will
go unanswered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have beginner special lists of
course to the same old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make sure that you post banner
saying beginners are welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beginner's welcome banner on a beautiful
established garden center is a huge deal
[SPEAKER_00]: to someone who always drove by was always
curious but scared poopless to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard to imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infographics are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate handouts and I'm still doing this
anyways because they're the right thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do just because I hate handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing trees and there's no
really great way to hand them out other
[SPEAKER_00]: than those little plastic take one things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that you should have
maybe even at the register.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also have your own infographics
and offer them online and use them in
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you're using merchandising
to lead the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lead people all the way through your
garden center from beginning to end so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they hit everything that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use potted plants to move people through
so that they can't get through to other
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to lead them all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that their eye is going exactly
where you want them to and you're hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: the things you don't want them to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're funneling people right towards the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you not follow a line of bowling
balls, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is not curious about what's going on
once you walk past what is going to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: past there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs next to nothing to use bowling
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this for sure because I have them
at my house and my neighbors complain
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs nothing to do this and people are
always curious and pizza delivery guys
[SPEAKER_00]: love me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbors don't but the pizza delivery
guys, they get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really who do I need to impress in
life?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pizza delivery guys are my neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pizza delivery guys every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pizza delivery guy just had twins Luke
and Leia and I was like, you are my
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke and Leia, you are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't care about the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about the guy who's the dad of Luke
and Leia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes him Darth Vader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't spoil anything for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That movie came out in 1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you're leading people around your
store, you also want to inspire them,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them ideas how things can come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how you add to sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't just want to come in for one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in for two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in for the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in for the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're directing people through your
garden center while you're also selling
[SPEAKER_00]: them ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite favorite garden center trick
is to use the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make arrows through garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write soil this way and draw an arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made very intricate oriental rugs
underneath patio sets out of chalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also get young people like six,
seven, eight years old to help me out with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really obviously very elaborate
and always stays within the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chalk, paint, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the ground to direct people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use stuff judiciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we get in that truckload of
300 knockout roses and we just make a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: of 300 knockout roses right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those knockout roses go in back
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stay in a pile until they
dwindle in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use things more judiciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use those 300 knockout roses to make
your entire path going all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more work, but they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use actual visual merchandising
cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the grocery store where they keep
the milk in the back, you just put those
[SPEAKER_00]: pink petunias in the back, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the hanging baskets in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have to go through and be
subjected to all your awesome products and
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome ideas on the way back to get the
totally boring things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Kiss My Aster vortex from one to
10 of how boring or cool a display could
[SPEAKER_00]: be, this is like a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like as boring as a display could
be, as lush as a display could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit better than basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not, it's cool, but it's not that
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some weird stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough plants for my liking,
but it's giving ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving people permission,
which I think that people desperately need
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, permission to let their freak
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak flag fly in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening used to be an expression of
creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel now like it's becoming more of
an expression of, God, don't let my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like this bar is set for
like beige, beige gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to bring back the weird in
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why I have two mannequins and
12 pipe organ pipes in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my part to help all of you bring
gardening back to fun and funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can you do to create a
conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like many garden centers are ruled
with the fear of what if I upset somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let that one squeaky person who
complains that something's inappropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: or something's not right or not,
it's just not the thing that they want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let that one person who's going to
complain keep us from impressing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more people, the busloads of people who'd
be like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to Instagram this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell my friends like,
hey, they have this sign about the prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to create a buzz and a sensation
with very little effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little bit of paint and a
lot of cactuses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I go into a garden center,
that these are my people and that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, from seeing a sign like this,
I know that I'm going to get along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that work there, get along with
the management, and that they probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have cooler stuff than other garden
centers that may not take this kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this tells me that I'm shopping
someplace cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel cool to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the people that work there
have a sense of humor and that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have something to talk to me
about, that they have something to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just so into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to connect with the people that
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a garden center I never would have
gone into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of, it's still in Chicago,
but it's just outside of Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the kind of place that I would
have driven past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figured that they have geraniums
and spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never would go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I was wrong about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're obviously cool and funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't even have to really be that
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who hasn't done the, we're so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wet our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been sent it into our inboxes 37
times in 37 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, wet our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still put that sign out front.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are still going to laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that, going back to social
media, this is something that if I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a garden center, I would
absolutely share this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely put it on my Facebook
page and send it out to 4,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would share the location of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone would have a little talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just not having this kind of fun
day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Aquascape has a peeing dog water
feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any of you seen that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 24 hour dog peeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe think that a storefront like
this was a little too fancy for me because
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little bit of a, I don't know,
a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this out front, I would
absolutely check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the number one thing that
would get me into a garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel, I know garden centers have,
they make a list of their top selling
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they eliminate the bottom,
what, 15% every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom 15% are exactly what I want to
be buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be buying those bottom 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't get rid of the bottom 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that bottom 15%, put it on an end
cap, and have a sales person standing
[SPEAKER_00]: there being like, these are weird plants
and this is why they're weird and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have weird plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people who don't know a petunia from
a tomato steak want to have something cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and different, but they just need it
explained to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we, we're becoming more,
so basically we're becoming more like the
[SPEAKER_00]: big boxes and just selling basic stuff and
getting rid of the cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, it makes me, it bothers me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden center, super sexy sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the sexy in gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are all about sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the geranium super sexy
geranium sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color blocking, that's some photo-worthy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost much to make a display
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I think at Flora Grubb in
California, which is something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have photographed thousands of times and
shared these photos thousands of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people take a vacation out,
there's something that they want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and take their picture next to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine having your garden center
as a vacation destination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why can't you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you think it costs to get an
old rusty car dropped in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center and use it as a shelf for plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need the space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, you're not going to
copycat this, but I will tell you the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a garden center in downtown
Chicago, which is a weird place to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be selling plants and look up and
there's skyscrapers all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an unusual place to sell plants to
people who never felt, didn't feel grass
[SPEAKER_00]: under their feet on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was already an unusual customer
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my, three of my greatest fights
with customers there, it was the first guy
[SPEAKER_00]: who was really upset that I told him that
Boston Ivy wouldn't grow on his
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The woman who didn't understand why I told
her she couldn't have a cut leaf Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: maple growing in her dining room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite is the guy who wanted,
he had a Frasier fur, a fresh cut Frasier
[SPEAKER_00]: fur for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called us in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a wealthy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like you to root this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made the mistake of saying,
sir, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really should have just taken his money
and given him a bald and burlap Frasier
[SPEAKER_00]: fur.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been through, it's been through
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooting process is very difficult,
sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this garden center for fall,
when things are slowing down, I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: good 48 inch terracotta pot and put a
rebar in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I built a three cage topiaries out of
chicken wire, filled it with moss and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and inserted little four inch cabbages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was like 12 feet tall when I
was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never got to being done because it
turns out nothing sells four inch cabbages
[SPEAKER_00]: at 795 in downtown Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like someone playing with them,
basically me touching them and adding them
[SPEAKER_00]: to this topiary meant that they sold
faster than any cabbages have ever sold
[SPEAKER_00]: for 795.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got to finish it because it
just drew so much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The act of putting a display together in
front of other people, it's theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a story to, hey, I bought this
cabbage today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 795, but this lady was putting it
at the top of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the kind of person that appeals to
you, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of things you can use to
make things cool and give them a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I bought this horse tail rush today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in an old rusty bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I bought some succulents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were under a decrepit piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an experience buying something out of
a old stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at a garden center outside of
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lit up at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are old shovels and rakes that have
been coated with glue and glitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost them nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things end up as sign holders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hang them from the greenhouse ceiling
and they hang signs off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lay them on either side of a walkway
to guide people from walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've used these glittered tools for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have a ton of them, so it didn't
cost anything to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really fun thing for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun thing for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glitter's fun for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you don't want me to talk
about social media, but I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some things that I know about
social media that come with fun and funky
[SPEAKER_00]: is that even when you're posting things
and there's no interactions, it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: no one's looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the new thing that the kids are
doing now is that they don't even give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's so cool, they won't even push
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to keep going even though
you're getting absolutely no validation
[SPEAKER_00]: for it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you're the boss doesn't mean
you need to be doing social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find someone who enjoys doing
it and let them do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a team of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't push Instagram at you hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other industries, they are using our
tools for visual merchandising way better
[SPEAKER_00]: than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that soak in for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're selling high-end shoes here using
our wheelbarrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a fancy jewelry store
using our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we ever think of using that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us, these are tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't use these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be bizarre, but it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pointing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're like arrows pointing
down at the things they want you to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that we're merchandising for all
generations and all price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big believer in terrariums because
they can be made for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use things we find on the ground at
work to make a terrarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little droppings of succulents,
little pieces of this and little pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cost nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make them out of old spaghetti jars,
ball jars, things I find at the thrift
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be making and selling terrariums
for next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a really great draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great draw in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they're using the hell strip
gardening book to market both the book and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very specific kind of gardening
for city dwellers, people who have that
[SPEAKER_00]: hell strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what that is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The area between the road and the
sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's the pizza oven because all
that hardscaping gets so hot that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just wants to burn up and die
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cross-promoting with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken the plants from the book and
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the millennials have burned
through the air plants and they won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're burning through succulents and
cactuses are it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be here for kind of a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gear up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little thrift store teacups with
succulents in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This costs so little to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you have someone who comes
in and they want a succulent, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good chance that this is what they wanted
to make with it, but if you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: offering it, they'll take that shortcut,
but you have to have it for them to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a happy spring thing for kids to
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty for all of us, but this is
the kind of place that if I took my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter, who's six, to a garden center
and she would then recall that experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, hey mom, let's go to the
place with the rain boots outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that even kids would find
whimsical and interesting, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the piles of stinky boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that would cost anything
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been wanting to throw those boots
away for at least four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang them from a fence and plant them
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rust and I, we go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something interesting, adding a
little bit of whimsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much would it cost to French braid
some Miscanthus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you guys already think of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, where's your head at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be French braiding Miscanthus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought of this, but I did buy
chip clips that looked like hair bows and
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in Miscanthus to try to get my
daughter to play with grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes it her time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She steps into the Miscanthus and she
says, coming out at a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all be adding a little bit of
whimsy and this really is going to hook in
[SPEAKER_00]: these, they're called Generation Z,
the youngest kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we may have, it was the baby
boomers and we've gone right to
[SPEAKER_00]: millennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never really got Generation X our
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, digging into Generation Z is going
to be where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take the lesson of completely
forgetting about X and already start
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on Z and welcoming them into
garden centers, creating a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: whimsy, play spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Z is young, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 20 and younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to really open up fun spots for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way you can do that, for free,
is to let the kids paint a rock while
[SPEAKER_00]: their mom or dad shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rock lives in the garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that kid's going to want to come
back and visit that rock?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you're going to hear,
hey mom, I want to go to the place and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit my rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, that kid is going to want to visit
their rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a return visit right
then and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let kids paint on a fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Chicago, we have a lot of restaurants
that encourage graffiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graffiti becomes, once it gets layered
up to a couple summers of it, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: its own kind of weird art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let kids paint their own faces on
fence posts while their parents shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a little obstacle course from
the crawl through kids' gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can show parents exactly how to do a
kids' garden, how to make it fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get kids involved in gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, you can sell a lot of those
little plastic shovels with butterflies on
[SPEAKER_00]: it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they might be the easiest to
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they're the most loyal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has such a fun time when we go
to IKEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asks to go to IKEA all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be doing that at garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden centers are a heck of a lot more
fun than IKEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, almost anything is,
except the Swedish meatballs are really on
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be creating that kind of fun very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a pile of dirt for kids to
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard would that be for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your kids have some dirt to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to come back for the rest of
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In autumn, we have a hard time
merchandising those pumpkins, so why not
[SPEAKER_00]: make a little labyrinth for kids to walk
through?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would cost nothing to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing this with mown grass too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a field, let the field grow
for two weeks and then mow a labyrinth in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to keep kids busy and
occupied and create an experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to want to recapture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairy gardens are so not my favorite
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that they would go away,
but they're not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that need to be reupholstered are
next to free on Craigslist or in junkyards
[SPEAKER_00]: or thrift stores, and this could be very
easily replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to best be part of your community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you're offering classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Silks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if every greenhouse roof can
support a group of 15 people doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you could be doing yoga easily,
especially in the winter if you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: heating those greenhouses anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually have people coming in
and having our yoga, and then maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a plan on their way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Painting classes are awful, but what they
come with is lots of wine, and a liquored
[SPEAKER_00]: up customer is always a customer with an
open purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly recommend that plants and wine,
they go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed starting classes have been a really
big deal in early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing is that, as we all
know, people want to start their seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: January when it's way too early to start
their seeds, so you need to be setting
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty strong messages in January
that, yes, we have a seed starting class
[SPEAKER_00]: in March when you're supposed to be doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning classes have been a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fancy cocktails like growing lemon verbena
for cocktails, and here's what you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canning and preserving is a huge deal,
and if you sell canning and preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, it's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual gardening classes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of passe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knitting, you could just sit around and
knit, have a knitting circle come,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sit in your greenhouse or garden
center, and book clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Book clubs also come with wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, do events.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money in events.
[SPEAKER_00]: People keep getting married.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people open their pockets,
and it just starts throwing around when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting married.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weddings, parties, charity, fundraisers,
meeting space, especially for garden
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of garden clubs are always
looking for space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom's Night Out is this thing where each
mom in the group has to take a different
[SPEAKER_00]: night in the month, and they try to up the
other moms, and it ends up where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: renting out entire garden centers and
doing plant and container parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't charge them much other than
enough to keep the place open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then give them a little discount on
the plants and the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have guaranteed 15 or 20 sales that
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not such a bad way to stay open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straw bales are great for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wedding in a garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you identify the actual garden center
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point is that you and your staff
are having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customers will feel it, and it's
important that it doesn't become drudgery,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it's 98 degrees out,
and you just got to get that stuff watered
[SPEAKER_00]: eight times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you pick up the hose,
someone's like, excuse me, where's the
[SPEAKER_00]: geraniums and spikes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that these would help if you
could get one of these for everybody on
[SPEAKER_00]: your staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most truthy gardening shirt ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, where's lunch,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to yell at me and tell me
I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have told you about it under the
duress of some sangria, sir, but I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to talk about my new book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about the old book,
but everyone probably doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you about the old book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old book is aimed at new homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aimed towards new homeowners who buy
a house and they have this existing
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping that just isn't their taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a graphic guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The illustrations are very trippy and a
little bit psychedelic and odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of text in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of each page, you choose your
own adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to read the whole book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just read the parts you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very weird book with at least five
references to the Beastie Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six references to Spinal Tap and two
references to Star Wars, just like this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a second book, but I'm not
allowed to talk about it unless I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: sangria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have sangria with you,
you have some?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of telling you, maybe I can show
you a couple garden centers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: killing Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are garden centers on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are followed by every gardener in
America, not just in their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're killing it, if they're really
doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find one right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just hope there's nothing
inappropriate in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one, Natural Plus in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just something like this is just
genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got 12 likes on it, which is kind
of a lot in the world of this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see some of the things
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can find someone who's
doing a little bit racier things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you know what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do a search here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is just photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You post something like a sale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you all the information you need
there in the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the bottom right here,
it gives you all the information that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't use any hashtags if you're
hashtag phobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people just are like,
hashtags are stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a really great function,
which is they create a live link to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't at least use your town's
name, that's the least thing you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take pictures at a garden center,
I use the hashtag independent garden
[SPEAKER_00]: centers and garden centers, which means if
you click on that, you can see pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: independent garden centers all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's interested in independent
garden centers, then they can check them
[SPEAKER_00]: all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else they're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictures of cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every third or fourth photo should not be
pictures of product, pictures of how many
[SPEAKER_00]: people come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this picture scroll across your
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you want ... Hey,
a lot of people show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go to that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that way when you see this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This must be a pretty good thing if
there's that many people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flash sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cute stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you should be doing
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no idea where to start,
start at A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's a picture of Ansonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow's a picture of Budlia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You write a little something about what
you know about that plant, how much it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of garden centers who on
their front page don't even have their
[SPEAKER_00]: address or town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Address and town is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, address and town is important,
but it's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be the most creative
thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to be the truth of what your
garden center is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a little flavor of where you are,
and you need to try to seek out other
[SPEAKER_00]: people in your area and follow them,
and they'll usually follow you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions and comments are my favorite
part, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to be the next fairy garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure because fairy gardens is
going to stick around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just so cheap and plasticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like fairy gardening to be a
little bit more authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you have an authentic fairy
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be then insinuating that fairies
are not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like storm trooper gardening to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to build a Death Star out of
begonias and blow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would like it to be more fun and
less cheesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I have a problem with the
idea of fairy gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real problem with the way it's
played out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there another question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I love questions so much.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two daughters in
[SPEAKER_01]: their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their mother is doing horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first garden center boss is my best
friend's mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's taught me everything I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does her daughter, my best friend,
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: She does her pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows what she likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a lot of knowledge from being
exposed to it, but she is not interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a daughter who knows at six years
old the name of all the plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a new homeowner, you must do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, cut down the burning bush,
kill it with fire, and also douse gasoline
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bigger than that, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge core aeration believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the most people I talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worry too much about their lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a perfect lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slap them twice, once this way and once
that way, and tell them to snap out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a long rant about lawns and
who are they really supporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: After my rant is over, then I'm like,
but you can core aerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good way to get moisture
down to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would talk to someone about making sure
red mulch doesn't ever taint your
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would talk about growing food because
it's such a rewarding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start harvesting, it's like
winning this personal lottery in your mind
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get young gardeners to feel that
feeling, we can trick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trick them the rest of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you know it, they'll be buying
paper birches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What isn't in my front yard?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tearing up the turf in my front yard
and putting in big drifts of perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a mid-century modern ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it modern looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it a little bit more
business in front and party in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At my front door, which is recessed,
this summer's theme was a tribute to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Polynesian Resort at Walt Disney World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mannequin there handing out
lays.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in a tropical dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a chair with a pillow with a dull
whip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever had a dull whip,
you'll be like, I will buy that pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a dull whip?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole front door is tropical right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dahlias and tomatoes coming out
of swaths of bronze funnel and perilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very weird, but I get a lot of
compliments on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken me five years to do a chunk
because I have a six-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to increase my speed now that
she's six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot more to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backyard is a lot weirder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tattoo shack, a mud laboratory,
the pipe organ pipes, several old
[SPEAKER_00]: bicycles, and a lot of bowling balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to balance it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't just be plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is such a strong statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you why you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back me up, ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonsai is for dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say so is Voldemort?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that Bonsai takes so much care
and control, and I personally have no time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that a lot of women would
feel that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it controlling?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some need more control than others.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
