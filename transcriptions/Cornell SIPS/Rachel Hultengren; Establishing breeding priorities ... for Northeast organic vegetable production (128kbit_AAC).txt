[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'll be talking about my work the
past couple of years that I've been here
[SPEAKER_00]: in establishing breeding priorities and
developing cultivars for organic vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: growers here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic growers, as I'm sure you all know,
face unique challenges to their
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the organic standard,
which was put in place in 2002,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are limitations on the sorts of
materials that organically certified
[SPEAKER_00]: growers can use in their production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of major differences
between organic and conventional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the issue of soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without synthetic fertilizers,
organic farms are often quite nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: limited, though organic growers do have
ways of managing their soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing the nitrogen through the
application of animal manure and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogenous cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still often the case that there's
less nitrogen available for their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic growers, like conventional
growers, face major disease and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike conventional growers,
where there are quite effective chemically
[SPEAKER_00]: based management tools, organic growers
often lack effective approved materials to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage these challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're more often reliant on
genetic resistance to these challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: than conventional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed management is also a big issue in
organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic growers also need to use
organically certified seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organic farm is different from a
conventional farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a question of, do we need to
be breeding for organic management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't we already breeding for disease
resistant and nutrient use efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to organic farms,
organic production, there's a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: of priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with disease resistance, for example,
there are diseases that are well managed
[SPEAKER_00]: under conventional production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common bunt in wheat, for example,
has been very effectively managed through
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of seed treatments, which are not
approved materials for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an instance where genetic
resistance would be more important,
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher priority for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for organic production to be
particularly successful, growers need
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that excel under organic
conditions, which means that we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: trialing varieties under organic
management if they're meant for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, or develop varieties that are
intended specifically for organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we develop those varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the ways that I've been
thinking about it is a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptability and stability under different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graph from Finley and Wilkinson
shows a trial of barley varieties under
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the x-axis shows the mean yield of all
of the varieties in seven different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every variety, their yield in
those environments is plotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average yield of all the varieties
is the dashed line here with a slope of 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And varieties that these authors label as
well adapted or generally adapted are
[SPEAKER_00]: those that do well under all environments,
do better than average under all
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety A in this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety B is an example of a poorly
adapted variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does worse than the average across
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety C is a variety with low stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does particularly poorly in
low-yielding environments, but well when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in a good field generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the particularly interesting for my
purposes is variety D here, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety with high stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does pretty well under low-end
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does well in low-yielding environments,
but it does the same generally across
[SPEAKER_00]: those environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the authors of this paper conclude that
selecting for high-yielding varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: under high-yielding conditions,
if you don't know how those varieties do
[SPEAKER_00]: under low-yielding conditions,
can result in varieties that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly do well under those
low-yielding environments, which we can
[SPEAKER_00]: think of as being representative perhaps
of organic management conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for varieties that do well under good
conditions, those might not be appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Kevin Murphy demonstrated this
again in a study that was done in 2007
[SPEAKER_00]: with wheat varieties where they under in
five different environments looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of these varieties under
conventional and organic management and
[SPEAKER_00]: then ranked them according to yield and
showed that the yield rank changed quite
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically between conventional and
organic conditions, suggesting that if
[SPEAKER_00]: this was in a breeding program,
selecting for the lines that did well
[SPEAKER_00]: under conventional management would not
have resulted in lines that were that good
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those that did the best under organic
management weren't the ones that would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been chosen under a conventional
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some traits that are
generally important to organic growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that are dictated by the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are traits that are region
or market specific, which also need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered when we are looking to support
a particular community of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this instance, some of the work that
I've done has been particular to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast and organic growers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke last year about a report that we
were writing that summed up results of a
[SPEAKER_00]: survey that we did asking growers,
vegetable growers here in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: who were using organic practices,
what was most important to them and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the traits were that they would like to
suggest be worked on to support their
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the report that we put out
last August was a prioritization of many
[SPEAKER_00]: specific crop specific trait needs for
organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top five sets are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those that are under bullet point three
were all deemed to be as important,
[SPEAKER_00]: more important than four and five,
but not as important as one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that there's a mix of
traits that are specific to the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: and culture of the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like stress tolerance for
broccoli, heat tolerance for arugula,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to diseases in high tunnels,
which are increasing in prevalence here
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic growers in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also traits that are important
for consumer demands, like the color and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to take the varieties that do
well for the growers that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities that they're looking for,
like flavor, this was a graph showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: growers rate flavor as being a really
important quality in breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to take varieties that already
do well in the markets for these growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve the traits that will help
those varieties excel under Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The report that we put out last year,
we put up on eCommons and I'm hopeful that
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be a useful tool for anyone who's
interested in working on developing
[SPEAKER_00]: organic varieties, whether that's at
institutions like Cornell or at seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk very briefly about two
efforts that I've been working on in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing varieties for growers here in
the Northeast, but generally across the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: under the Northern Organic Vegetable
Improvement Collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is disease resistant, high quality
Delicata squash, and the other is an early
[SPEAKER_00]: blocky bell pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the survey results we asked folks
to rate the importance of different
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases as breeding priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we asked was about
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people who responded to the
question said, yes, this is a big problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for us in cucurbit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we would like
people to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Delicata work that I've been doing,
I have been looking at powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and Cornell Bush Delicata in
the far right bottom corner is the source
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew resistance that I used a
couple of summers ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also crossed it with a couple of
commercial lines with higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three boxes here, which have,
as you can see from last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot higher severity of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breeding lines that I've been
working on, I was able to fix the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance using a caps marker that
was developed in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those show very low powdery
mildew severity in the field, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have been looking at screening the
material for bricks as an assay for
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second breeding project that
I've been working on is an early blocky
[SPEAKER_00]: bell pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers here in the Northeast,
organic vegetable growers, often grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, which is called Ace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks have said that they like the
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces quite a lot of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces mature fruit earlier than
other varieties that they've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could use some changes in the fruit
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard several people independently
tell me that they think it looks really
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly, which maybe shouldn't matter,
but apparently it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I crossed Ace to a blockier bell
pepper called Aristotle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were both hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, I grew F2 families,
which sounds weird to say, and looked for
[SPEAKER_00]: early early-ness in these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parents are Ace and Aristotle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing the percent of the
plot that was flowering on July 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ace had already passed the 50% point,
and Aristotle was still not really
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I identified four lines that were almost
as early as Ace, if not earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then looked for blocky fruit and have
identified two promising lines that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be trialing, along with the Delicatas,
here in Freeville and on some organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farms here in the Northeast, in New York,
as well as at our partner institutions in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington through
Novick, which I'm pretty excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to thank
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has been helpful, and there are many
people, and our funding source of the
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA, NIFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I will maybe take a question if
Uche says I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your survey, you had organic growers
that were certified and non-certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any differences between those
two groups and their answers to questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't any real differences between
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked them to self-identify whether
they were certified or not certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the non-certified were all growers who
were following NOP practices or who were
[SPEAKER_00]: not certified, but naturally labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were using practices that were
quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were curious to see if those groups had
different thoughts, but they all sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to have the same things to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the genetics of the blocky shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of the blocky shape,
I don't remember the names of the genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been identified for fruit shape,
but I know that there aren't many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling fruit shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question that I'll be sure
to read up more closely on before my exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Mark.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
