[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Johannes, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will be going over the three chapters
of my dissertation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them revolve around the concept
of molecular diversity of soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, how decomposition affects it,
and how that affects its persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you all know, soil organic matter is a
fraction of soil organic matter consists
[SPEAKER_01]: of plant or animal tissue in various
stages of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil organic matter lends many physical,
chemical, biological benefits to soil
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another large function that soil organic
matter provides is its ability to retain
[SPEAKER_01]: organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, soil contains three times the
amount of carbon as the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the balance between soil organic
carbon and carbon stored in the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: as carbon dioxide or methane is really
dependent upon microbial respiration of
[SPEAKER_01]: that carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually a very old question of
what are the controls that are influencing
[SPEAKER_01]: the retention of carbon in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's such an old question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite papers to go back to
every once in a while and read is this
[SPEAKER_01]: paper from 1925 by Solomon Waxman,
What is Soil Humus?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked this important question,
which is really a driving question in my
[SPEAKER_01]: research as well, which is why does a part
of organic matter decompose rapidly and
[SPEAKER_01]: apart and very slowly?
[SPEAKER_01]: He points out the economic importance of
this question because at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: really they're thinking of nutrients and
nitrogen and the minerals that plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, there's this added economic
importance for climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the current view of how we understand
organic matter being cycled in soils is
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's this continuum as organic
matter is progressively decomposing and as
[SPEAKER_01]: it decomposes, it becomes smaller and
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along this continuum, it has the ability
to chemically interact with minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: the absorption or desorption, and also
physically might be included or released
[SPEAKER_01]: into aggregates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this process, along with some of the
bigger environmental variables,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as temperature and moisture,
pH, soil microbial humidity, overall
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts the retention time of carbon in
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently though, we've been thinking
about some other processes that affect
[SPEAKER_01]: organic carbon cycling and probably the
heterogeneity of soil itself as they
[SPEAKER_01]: control and prevent cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's spatial heterogeneity,
so the co-location of organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, microbes, there's temporal
variability, and then there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular diversity for variability and
organic matter properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, what I am focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I define molecular diversity as the
number and quantity of distinctly
[SPEAKER_01]: different compounds in soil organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being clear that I'm talking about
diversity of molecules and not diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: of microbes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big question to my researchers
really does molecular diversity affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: composition of soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hypothesized that as diversity of
molecules increases, we would have slower
[SPEAKER_01]: rate of decomposition because the energy
return on investment by microorganisms to
[SPEAKER_01]: use each of these individual compounds
would become unfavorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to make new enzymes or
upper-ability new phenabolic pathways to
[SPEAKER_01]: tackle each new compound that they come in
contact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of the step one hypothesis
that went into diversity of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that decomposition itself might
increase molecular diversity as microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: add all these new compounds in their
metabolism to the pool of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might actually increase molecular
diversity itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this feedback loop between
decomposition processes and molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity that I am also going to try to
untangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more foundation information.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I measuring and quantifying
molecular diversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are studies that are looking at,
they often call it hemo-diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those studies are more qualitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to be quantitative,
quantifying all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do that, I'm looking at the
dissolved organic matter pool from soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where you do a water
extraction and you still throw out 0.2
[SPEAKER_01]: microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the pool of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually the most bioavailable and
usable by microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step is actually identifying
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, I use untargeted tandem
liquid form-targeted PMS spectrometry,
[SPEAKER_01]: so LC-MS-MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I can then identify the different
compounds based on mass-to-charge ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: and retention times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you match those with known non-standard
libraries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use C18 and Hill columns for polar and
non-polar compound identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an example, Vectra,
where you have the mass-charge on the
[SPEAKER_01]: x-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this has to be on the y-axis
between two different soil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each of these different mass-to-charge
ratios could be considered a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's the height you use to
calculate the relative proportion of that
[SPEAKER_01]: compound in your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three big types of calculations to
quantify molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are really borrowed from
anthropologists trying to apply them to
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is just molecular
richness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just the number of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the most basic form of
diversity quantification, which gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: really no information about the molecules,
just the number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it treats all rare compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All compounds as one, so it's really
equally weighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is an abundance-based
molecular diversity equation, where then
[SPEAKER_01]: you take into account the proportion of
the molecules across samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you kill numbers when the Q
quotient equals two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is synonymous with the Simpson
diversity index, but it gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: effective number of compounds back instead
of the denominator index.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this favors the common compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's sort of lacking
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next step is then to add
information about the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using a trait-based molecular diversity
equation, I use Raoult's quadratic
[SPEAKER_01]: entropy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the hell number is a probability
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entropy equation, so it's
different in that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also incorporates a distance matrix
of a molecular property of my choosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be something like an activation
state or a mass that gives us an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe how that molecule behaves in the
soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as ecologists want to know the
types of organisms there, so a gorilla and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lizard are very different in an
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, a lipid and organic acid might
also be equally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know their properties when
we're calculating diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use the terms alpha molecular
diversity and beta molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I define alpha molecular diversity as
the diversity within one sample and beta
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular diversity as the diversity
across samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started my PhD,
I did a literature review on what did we
[SPEAKER_01]: know about molecular diversity in natural
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the only field of scientists
that were working on quantifying this were
[SPEAKER_01]: marine scientists or aquatic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, Corsing-Dittmar's group has
a lot of work around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found this one paper where they did
try to quantify diversity in a way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a marine geom incubation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they did molecular richness,
molecular abundance, and then a tree
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity equation where they used the
oxidation state of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, what they found is what we
hypothesized, where there would be this
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in diversity initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then over time, the plateau would be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this defined functional
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to know, so this is a
marine system with continuous mixing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and no minerals, and no plant roots,
and it's all homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we find in these same terms in
a soil system?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really where we got to my first
chapter, which is really, do ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: properties or microbe decomposition affect
molecular diversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really a step one proving
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does molecular diversity even vary across
landscape?
[SPEAKER_01]: In these very different ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we measure it too?
[SPEAKER_01]: And quantify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used soil samples from six different
ecosystems that we did as a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: collection effort with some postdocs in
Johannes' lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grouped these samples by vegetation
class, so dominant vegetation class,
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil order.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're representative in two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see from these photos that
they're very different from one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're groupings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also took samples from the litter layer
down to the sea horizon so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: use soil depth as a property for duration
of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that organic matter found in the
sea horizon is generally older than that
[SPEAKER_01]: found in the litter layer or a horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way, we could use depth as a
property for time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hypothesized that because
microorganisms have one ability to call
[SPEAKER_01]: the action, they're the one that's going
to have their transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have greater control on
organic matter and molecular diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: than the plant litter inputs themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you get down to the sea
horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping right into the results,
here I'm showing hydrophilic and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrophobic compounds identified using
LC-MS on the helix-saving columns.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this project, I actually used negative
on causative mode and either on water and
[SPEAKER_01]: methanol extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also looking about these plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is molecular richness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know A, molecular diversity,
these antibiotics, whole numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the functional or trait molecular
diversity equation in panel C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depth is on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that there's this decline in this
alpha molecular diversity with soil depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most noticeable decline,
really, is from this litter layer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the litter samples, down to your first
mineral A horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to point out this very
interesting trend for the functional
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity with the hydrophobic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tuck that away for another
chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is this initial increase and
decrease with depth there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I separate these out by ecosystem,
and I'm just showing molecular richness,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see that generally there's always
going to be this decrease in richness from
[SPEAKER_01]: the litter layer down to the A horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's variation once you get to the
mineral horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there are a lot of
different properties that soils have that
[SPEAKER_01]: could cause this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, the connector scores in
the graph count is just a large increase
[SPEAKER_01]: from the B horizon to the C horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that holds true for the hydrophobic
compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, you know, this must be
some sort of environmental variable or
[SPEAKER_01]: soil property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did a whole bunch of regressions
with all the other properties that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: measured, which is soil texture,
sandstone, silt clay, hydroxylamine
[SPEAKER_01]: intractable, oxides, iron, aluminum,
manganese, carbon concentrations,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen concentrations, water only
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually found no consistent and
significant relationships between any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these properties in our molecular
diversity indices.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did not measure any microbial
information of this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought, okay, there is this decrease
in molecular diversity and richness with
[SPEAKER_01]: depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then are all of those compounds that are
accumulating in the C horizon the same
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial products?
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be similar across ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to try to answer that question,
I did an upset plot analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plots look a little bit more
complicated than they really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll walk you through the different
panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a litter A and B horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the compounds are separated by
horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I binned them into basically two
different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, does that compound occur in all of
the compounds denoted by these black dots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it only in one individual ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intercept exercise is the number of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ecosystems also have the
number of compounds that are within that
[SPEAKER_01]: individual ecosystem for that horizon or
layer next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all colored by compound
classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the litter layer, there are 471
compounds that were shared across all 50
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time you get to,
so the type of subject is our next one
[SPEAKER_01]: here, it has only 40 unique compounds in
the litter layer for the type of subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you read these plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most notable finding from these is
that by the time you go from the litter
[SPEAKER_01]: layer to A horizon, there's already a 65%
reduction in shared compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get to the C horizon,
there's only 75%, or there's a 75%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's lots of shared compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the litter layer really shares four
times the number of compounds as the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsoil C horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this way, so we're losing richness,
but we're actually increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: similarity across ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is further displayed by a non-metric
initial scaling plot, just coordinating
[SPEAKER_01]: the hydrophilic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the litter layer here
in these dark green symbols clustered
[SPEAKER_01]: together really closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas all the mineral samples kind of
mismatch over one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the one type of ecosystem
type did explain 10% of the variance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but horizon, it's like 21% of that
clustering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further driving my arm about the
similarity in the subsoils across
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the NMBS is a breaker in system
automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the program that's doing this is the
average breaker in the index.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's displayed by horizons in each
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can just see that there are
more yellows and oranges occurring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: C horizon, showing that there's just more
of the similarity across ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to summarize this chapter, and really
this is the title tagline of this paper
[SPEAKER_01]: that came out last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked that decomposition decreases
molecular diversity in ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: similarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, we found a decrease in alpha
molecular diversity with depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: an increase in beta molecular diversity
with depth though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diversity across ecosystems
increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, there are more shared
compounds in the litter layer compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the C horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's probably more sites that
say the compounds that microbes are making
[SPEAKER_01]: in the subsoils compared to what's being
inputted by the litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really this is a study about molecular
diversity across ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil depth for time and time of
millennia, long periods of time of
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really I wanted to next now like,
okay, what about true time and time that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can measure in the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do we find similar trends over
shorter period of decomposition time?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take to get to these
trends?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my next chapter is essentially that,
is how does molecular diversity change
[SPEAKER_01]: over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we identify the microbial products
or the diversity of those products and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that contributes to those changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to do this, I did a very simple,
I'm calling it a long-term time series
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment, but really it's relatively
short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only 220 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This PhD is only so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I used one microbial community and
one plant litter type and incubated that
[SPEAKER_01]: for 220 days and destructively harvested
microcosms at 14 different time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then analyzed the DNA extract with the
ATR, FTIR and TOC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there selected seven time points
and then analyzed using LC-MS to quantify
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next layer is then how do I
identify the microbial products?
[SPEAKER_01]: To do this, we wanted to try to use an
isotope label of O18 instead of a carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since there's some issues with using a
label carbon, we wanted to use O18.
[SPEAKER_01]: O18 is normally used by microbiologists to
do stable isotope probing to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: which microbes are actually present in a
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all microbes use water for the
most part during their metabolism and
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they generally take up that O18 and
add it to their DNA and then you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to know, okay, well,
can we use that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to use it to know which
compounds the microbes are producing or
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidizing or maybe they're implementing
some necromass that has this O18 in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we submitted a proposal to EMSL and
got an EMSL exploratory research grant to
[SPEAKER_01]: explore this and try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I chose two different time points,
day six and day 59 to then take a subset
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sample from the microcosms and
added either natural abundance water or
[SPEAKER_01]: O18 for a biotic and an abiotic just so it
parks out which compounds are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being produced with the O18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did water methanol fluorophore
special extraction, but I'm gonna only be
[SPEAKER_01]: going over the water extraction results
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: With fluorotransform, ions, resonance,
mass, spectrometry primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I hypothesized that because the
microbes are the ones that are not only
[SPEAKER_01]: are they transforming the organic matter
by cleaning all the different plant litter
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and oxidizing, hydrolyzing,
fermenting everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're making all these different
metabolites, enzymes, waste products,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more active the microbial
population is, the more diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds you will have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the results from the LC-MS
long-term time series experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, sorry, what we can see is that these
trends actually are very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: Maxwell profile trends, where duration of
decomposition is on the x-axis up until
[SPEAKER_01]: close to by date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Panel A is molecular richness,
the number of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have then our abundance, molecular
diversity, the Hill numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the large declines in richness
and diversity in the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this project, I use a multivariate
molecular trait diversity equation,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I use the nominal oxidation state of
carbon, oxygen and carbon ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen and carbon ratios, number of
nitrogen atoms and mass, all in one
[SPEAKER_01]: equation to try to get this whole molecule
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is that there's
actually, instead of an initial decrease,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an initial increase in molecular
trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diversity of molecular properties
is increasing initially as microbes are
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposing the litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Breaker's Discellularity
Indices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is showing, again, the similarity
across time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most notable thing, and you can
see here, is that you have these larger
[SPEAKER_01]: differences from day two, eight to 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bigger changes in the index,
bigger changes in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you get to day 60,
this is really the plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much change happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that with the curve as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, I can't tell if that color is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The O18 results from the XTRMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with XTRMS,
you're familiar with these Van Prevlin
[SPEAKER_01]: plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plots have oxygen and carbon ratios
on the X axis, and hydrogen and carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios on the Y axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are elemental, not mass,
ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing the, so the top left plot is
the O18 isopropylene rich compounds from
[SPEAKER_01]: day seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the right is the, or the
non-isopropylene rich, and then the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: two panels are from day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plots, each point is an integral
peak identified with mass spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the coloration of that peak is
the relative abundance across samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often with Van Prevlin, you use some sort
of bridge to sort of try to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: properties of that molecule in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some different zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is more, these compounds are
more aliphatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones would be more aromatic,
more aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have low, mid, high oxygen and
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the right, these are just calculated
bar plots of the molecular richness of
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing the enriched to the non-enriched
for day seven and day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also hell number diversity,
and then our molecular trace diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: a multi-variant equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, complicated figure, kind of explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most important thing to take from
this figure, well, not most important,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the most obvious one, is that the
non-enriched pool has many more compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: than the enriched pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should note that the compounds,
these enriched ones, they were incubated
[SPEAKER_01]: for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a snapshot of what microbes are
producing within a 24-hour time frame at
[SPEAKER_01]: these two different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So non-enriched are more enriched,
more diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily, they're just kind of the
background models.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the molecular trait
diversity, there's actually equal trait
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity when you're considering these
peaks and these peaks at the early time
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though they differ in number,
the trait diversity is just as large.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, by day 60, there's a decline in
trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that there's a loss of these
aliphatic, well, the aliphatic region
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overall trait diversity between
day seven and day 60 does not differ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we go back to our time series plot,
these two compounds are essentially the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as these on the longer scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like we're picking up
on maybe these shoulders of trait
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity for day seven and day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of missed that initial peak
for the overall background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or also that maybe there's a lag where the
microorganism community starts making
[SPEAKER_01]: fewer and fewer diverse compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it takes a little while for that
to be shown in the overall curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, looking at what compounds are being
produced and consumed over these two time
[SPEAKER_01]: points, day seven and day 60, there's a
heat map of the different compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: identified with LPMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: For day seven and day 60, it's adjacent to
the O18 labeling experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brighter colors mean there are more
abundant, higher relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're seeing here is that the
sugar and the sugar alcohols at day seven
[SPEAKER_01]: are occurring in higher abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at day 60, there are more of
these organic acids, meaning that perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes are suing these carbohydrates
from the fresh plant litter inputs and
[SPEAKER_01]: then producing a whole bunch of organic
acids during their metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just sort of an overall
snapshot of what I think is happening for
[SPEAKER_01]: this chapter, where if you introduce
microbes to plant litter, there's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be this initial decrease in molecular
richness during rapid microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be consuming all these
different simple sugars, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: producing a wider range of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could be they're producing amino
sugars, organic acids like peptides,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you would get this
increase in molecular trait diversities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting this increase in the
different types of compounds that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding in the full organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with no new added plant litter or
substrate, microbial growth is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to have to start
recycling some of their own microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you would get sort of
this decline in molecular trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything comes back down to baseline as
microbes then start producing more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more molecular similar compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, maybe it's just all
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a study for one plant litter
type and one microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my next question is really,
does this hold true for different plant
[SPEAKER_01]: litter types in different microbial
communities and microbial diversities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is an established relationship
between microbial and molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen it, you can see for 2022,
that it's established across different
[SPEAKER_01]: biomes and a relationship between strength
is varied across biomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really I wanted to know, OK,
is this established relationship true with
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant litter types and for
different microbial communities?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my third chapter on our type of
microbial community diversity and
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular diversity of the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do this, I used five different plant
litter types.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are from similar samples used in my
first chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the same location where I
took the plant litter type, I took the
[SPEAKER_01]: A-horizons and the soil wash to generate a
microbial community inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this paper is really plant litter type
and microbial community are synonymous
[SPEAKER_01]: because you cannot sort of disentangle
that relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that's soil washed, then I have
the entire microbial diversity community,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is 10 to the 0, my stock community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get a serial dilution of those
communities, 10 to the minus 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this low microbial diversity
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say we because my undergraduate,
Caleb Levitt, and I worked on this for
[SPEAKER_01]: almost the entire semester just getting a
community together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the plant litter that is
complementary to that microbial inoculum
[SPEAKER_01]: was inoculated with either the high or the
low microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It incubated for 150 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the incubation,
the DOM was analyzed from molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity using LC-MS again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the microbial community was analyzed
using 16S RNA sequencing using the
[SPEAKER_01]: Illumina science platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have hypothesized that, again,
it's more about the microbial community
[SPEAKER_01]: structure than it is about where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, these dilution treatments had
an effect on the endpoint microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the results from the end of
150 days, not the starting point of the
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculum, but the end of the incubation
for microbial richness, microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, and microbial biogenetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am talking about microbial now and
molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll try to help you see them separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For microbial, more of the straight
diversity, I'm using a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: biogenetic diversity index using Rao's
project entropy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for this, I'm using the genome size,
the number of base pairs, the average
[SPEAKER_01]: number of base pairs per sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is trying to get, again,
an idea of that function of the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community in the soil, not just who's
there and how many of them are there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what are they doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about a 40% loss in microbial
richness for the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then aerotrophism is just a death
valley sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unique and just kind of a
bugaboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would not affect the richness,
but it did, a portion of those individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: were altered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have differences in biogenetic
diversity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coordinating the communities by river
type and microbial treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the PCA plot showing how they cluster
and just showing that the litter type more
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately explains the variance of the
clustering than the dilution treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which did have effect, but you can notice
that the dilution treatment actually
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the microbial communities closer
together in terms of composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're looking at the soil order,
the relative composition would be
[SPEAKER_01]: generally this loss in video bacteriales
and fertile areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a loss, but it's compositional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's generally more sphingopanelis
and gipanelis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry to make that up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new language for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting a suite of linear aggressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I'm plotting my microbial
diversity indices on the x-axis against my
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular diversity indices on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have microbial richness, molecular
richness, have a significant relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: here to our square of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbial diversity of the HAL numbers
is fairly related to the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of the HAL numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then actually genome size,
rather than the diversity equation with
[SPEAKER_01]: genome size, was very strongly related to
the molecular trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something about the microbial
communities function that is related to
[SPEAKER_01]: trait rather than just the number of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more often what people think about
is microbial richness is related to
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to account for the dilution treatment
and the litter type community type,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a multi-level correlation analysis
where it takes into account dilution and
[SPEAKER_01]: litter type as random effects into the
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just kind of proves the point
that genome size is the most strongest
[SPEAKER_01]: predictor of molecular trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though this interesting trend
where richness is related to richness and
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, diversity still holds true but
weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed something else different when I
was looking at these regressions is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the non-diluted communities actually tend
to have stronger relationships with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other than with the molecular diversity
indices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the diluted communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at molecular richness here on
the axis, it actually is related to all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the indices, but this relationship with
molecular richness is greatly improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for microbial diversity and molecular
diversity, and then similarly for genome
[SPEAKER_01]: size, the R-squared here is 0.66 for
molecular trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something happening here that I
find very interesting and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have the answer yet about the
disruption caused by my artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution to try to get this bigger range
of diversity has disrupted the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community functioning somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be they're taking out the
members of the community that are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in co-metabolism or thus the whole chain
disrupts, but these are just final
[SPEAKER_01]: viewings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, genome size is still the
best predictor of molecular trait
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to wrap up a little bit on
this big question of does DOM molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity influence organic matter
mineralization rate?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have not explained this experiment
yet, but at the end of the incubations
[SPEAKER_01]: from my second and my third chapter,
it paves to DOM from those end points.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I sent it off for Alzheimer's
analysis, I helped him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then took that DOM and added it into a
new microcosm, carbon normalized across
[SPEAKER_01]: each microcosm, which has clean sand,
and then added one microland community to
[SPEAKER_01]: that microcosm, and then measured
respiration over the next 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this cumulative respiration on
the y-axis, and then either molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: richness, my molecular abundance diversity
or trait diversity, on the x on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: panel, and then molecular properties on
the bottom panel, so the oxidation state
[SPEAKER_01]: of carbon, molecular weight, or degree of
saturation, which is a hydrogen carbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went together with the two projects,
but essentially the experiments were done
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, what I found is some weak
correlations that I don't really believe
[SPEAKER_01]: in for molecular richness and diversity,
which are just really being pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: By some, a few handful of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there actually does seem to be a
pretty good relationship between molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and their respiration rates
with that DOM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the oxidation state of
carbon, imagine that as these values
[SPEAKER_01]: become more positive, that compound is
more oxidized, therefore more readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available to be used, in comparison to
some of these more negative values that
[SPEAKER_01]: are more, a more reduced compound,
which have higher energy yields that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more energy possibly to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same principle for molecular weight,
where the bigger the compound is,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially the more the fluid is to be
degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are average values for an entire
pool of carbon in a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming back to this feedback loop,
decomposition and molecular diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, what have I learned about
decomposition and molecular diversity over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last six years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, decomposition, in the short term,
increases molecular trait diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a fresh plant-litter supply,
rapid growth, then all these new compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: will be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, without any new
plant-litter additions, you ultimately get
[SPEAKER_01]: this decrease in the number of different
compounds and trait diversity over time if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really no new food sources
stirring the total activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular diversity is influenced by
microbial diversity and community
[SPEAKER_01]: functioning, potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's influenced by litter type in the
fact that that could cause faster flow of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But litter type inputs don't actually
determine the endpoints molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of DOM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because litter A has a higher
starting point molecular diversity than
[SPEAKER_01]: litter B, it doesn't mean that litter A,
after 200 days of decomposition,
[SPEAKER_01]: is still going to have a higher diversity
than litter B.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more to do with the microbial
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, that microbial molecular
diversity may influence organic carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are truly some big hurdles to
overcome in terms of instrument
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities and some experimental
barriers to really getting at this
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about small molecules
that we're trying to identify all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one, cool, can quantify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank, of course,
my committee members and all of my
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborators or people that have helped
me along the way, let me use their lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me use their equipment, given me
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my funding opportunities that
I've had while I've been here and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: also want to shout out for the Shantel
Novak Small Grant Program that has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have been able to do this
research without that in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Pornholtz Center Graduate Research
Grants also largely funded this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, I'll take any questions.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your question about the type of
development because of the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity is that, and not only that,
but to make sure organic carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually processed by the microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's called to that
molecular diversity of organic matter is
[SPEAKER_00]: more determined by microbial population
rather than the type in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is that that's because you
only measure the molecular diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved organic carbon, which is usually
processed by microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deoamine essentially is, especially off of
a fresh plant litter, anything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: measure is already going to be like a
deoamine, microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the abiotic decomposition of plant
litter is probably quite small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're measuring is really all
microbial products from deoamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're getting at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're measuring is that there are all
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the molecular breakdown of the litter,
of the particular type, seems to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, everything that we measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the challenges with LCMS
is everything that we measure has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: filtered at point two microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the instrument itself actually
only measures between like 200 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand daltons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything below that is what we're
measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to sort of do some sort of
bulk analysis where then you can quantify
[SPEAKER_01]: what the diversity on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did try diversity calculations on
NEXAS spectra or FTIR spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very difficult.
Yeah.
Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very beginning in the depth
profiles, the sort of eyeball that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the hydrophobic compounds,
there is an increase in functional
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speculate why we see it there and
not for the hydrophilic compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that have anything to do with the
analysis or production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a true ecological or mixing or
movement?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thought about that is that for the
hydrophilic, they're much, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're hydrophilic, so they're more polar
and they can move through this profile
[SPEAKER_01]: probably better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hydrophobic ones are really more
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're sticky and neural and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially why we're seeing that trend
sort of last longer with the hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and not in the hydrophilic ones
that are more transient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just go back a couple of slides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a little bit nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone was here, but in final sentence,
the big question and the two experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: really identify different parts of the
graph and drive them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did an experiment separately for each
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I analyze them separately,
they have different trends a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which made me nervous about making any
declarative statements about those trends
[SPEAKER_01]: when they differ by project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went and lumped them together and
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are normalized by the amount of
carbon that was in the micropublis too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you really draw a line through the
terminate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pull them together when they're
just one to the bottom, one to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: left and the other one to the top right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is more just sort of muting
them on the big question and my best
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to answer it with the data that I
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much that's fascinating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to write about what this
is, but you mentioned something about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution disrupting group functional
communities or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the microbial diversity might be
working together against the graph?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is something I had to consider
when I was doing eight-year-old dilutions
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could just be completely disrupting
the function of that community through
[SPEAKER_01]: that process, even though it's already
quite a disruptive process to get to my
[SPEAKER_01]: stock community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step appeared to really disrupt
any relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thought process was, you're thinking
about this after lab group meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if a whole community, every
individual has a role in producing a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain metabolite or product that then
this organism uses, and it's like that
[SPEAKER_01]: chain reaction, they're all working
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you take out some of those species,
then you don't have the next person to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could be disrupting that
trend in terms of diversity of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you saying that you feel your
observation support that idea that the
[SPEAKER_00]: community does have this sort of
pass-along activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look into the data and look at
more of the minimal pathways that are
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can do that and see if I'm losing
certain pathways, that would then maybe be
[SPEAKER_01]: the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five different ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nice number at the beginning,
you check them one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they replicated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you really see that each one of them
is somehow co-parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there sort of all sorts of variation
within as much as across the ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were the three replicates sort of
representative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they sort of go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were definitely some
variations within those replicates because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a difference between some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we tried to want them in the best way
possible where the soil order was the same
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dominant vegetation type and
general employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of them were better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had lower variances in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot more variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not a way to distinguish between
depth and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't measure C14 on any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also really difficult to do on
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just using depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a proxy for time and assuming that
what's deeper is the older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, we could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in general, we think about the
samples that are in the northeast are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a lot younger than those in
the southeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be an age discrepancy
already that maybe we could use some
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Christina, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zipping off, I guess what Rebecca was
saying, do you think that the dilution
[SPEAKER_00]: step maybe lowers genome size if you would
account for the lower trachea diversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it appear that the dilution actually
lowered the average genome size for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some oddballs out here that are
driving this relationship, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in the same range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it's due to size.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do best dilutions do to the community
and how can they interpret?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it mean that these are
correlated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's obviously there's a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'd love to talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is more of just like the
interesting finding where I thought I was
[SPEAKER_01]: great and like this perfect, you know,
diversity gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
