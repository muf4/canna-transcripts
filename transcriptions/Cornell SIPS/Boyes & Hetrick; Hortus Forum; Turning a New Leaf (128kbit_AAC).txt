[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Marcia Eam-Shivley, for those of you
who don't know me, and I'm the faculty
[SPEAKER_03]: advisor for Hortus Forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a pleasure to be here today to be
introducing students who will be telling
[SPEAKER_03]: you about some new directions for Hortus
Forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do just want to have a couple of shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've moved to a shared leadership
approach with this really vibrant
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduate club and I just want to
acknowledge Leah Cook, who serves as an
[SPEAKER_03]: international trip advisor for these
students, and Betsy Lamb, who's recently
[SPEAKER_03]: joined our team.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is someone who has a real passion for
working with students, doesn't always get
[SPEAKER_03]: that opportunity, and really enjoys,
for example, the shorter trips here that
[SPEAKER_03]: students engage in and has been serving
more recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's entering in as something of a
meeting advisor, and Neil Madsen gives
[SPEAKER_03]: them guidance on growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel as if it's important to
name the ways in which Hortus Forum as an
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduate club is really drawing on a
lot of our resources, very wisely,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can work that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a pleasure to introduce Sarah and
Hawk today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the past couple of years,
Hortus Forum has been going through some
[SPEAKER_03]: really exciting changes, and these two
have been at the heart of some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: changes, really strengthening
accountability and responsibility in the
[SPEAKER_03]: club and the team of officers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Officers do receive credit for Hortus
Forum officer leadership development,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are a handful that aren't here
today just because of their schedules,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Sarah and Hawk will be guiding you
through some changes that they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah was the primary Hortus Forum
treasurer for the previous two consecutive
[SPEAKER_03]: years, and I have to tell you,
accountability has been her thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: just really strengthening that whole piece
in terms of working with SIPs and admin
[SPEAKER_03]: managers, just really strengthening the
accountability for the treasury.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a senior in plant sciences and
agricultural sciences with a concentration
[SPEAKER_03]: in crop production and management.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's also an undergraduate researcher in
Kettering's lab working on her senior
[SPEAKER_03]: honors thesis in soil nutrient management,
and she's looking to pursue a graduate
[SPEAKER_03]: degree in soil sciences upon graduation in
May.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawk Boyes is the current president of
Hortus Forum and the previous sales
[SPEAKER_03]: treasurer from last year, and he's a
senior in ag sciences with focuses in
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture, plant sciences, and
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Sullivan County, New York,
and was raised on a maple syrup farm with
[SPEAKER_03]: diversified agriculture, and after
college, he's looking into the
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture industry, public
horticulture, and education, having drawn
[SPEAKER_03]: positive experiences from working with
both the Cornell Botanic Gardens Youth
[SPEAKER_03]: Education Program and Ball Horticultural
Trial and Show Gardens, and I'm sure after
[SPEAKER_03]: you hear them today, you'll see that they
should likely have no trouble going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward in the world given their the way
in which they're ready to embrace
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation and change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a pleasure to introduce them
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for giving them your attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcia, for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, my name is Hawk and this is
Sarah, and we are representing the Hortus
[SPEAKER_00]: Forum, Cornell's undergraduate
horticulture club today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for our presentation is because
last spring we applied for an engaged
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership opportunity grant through
engaged Cornell, and one of our pay ups to
[SPEAKER_00]: that was to have a presentation at the end
of the year kind of summing up our
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection on the whole grant process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little background on Hortus Forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mission statement that's
cultivating a positive social community
[SPEAKER_00]: which fosters a passion for plants and
teaches the value of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to embody this in all the
activities that we do, and it's a plethora
[SPEAKER_00]: of activities throughout the semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesdays, we usually have meetings every
week except for the first Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an officer meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we do hands-on activities,
industry tours, whether they're local or
[SPEAKER_00]: even on campus, and then we do club
updates, so general club happenings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably seen sales around campus
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do Friday sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either a man lobby, physical sciences
building, or sometimes Hope Plaza,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we do social events also,
so where we kind of connect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: community but also have our name tied to
it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more on our engaged leadership grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a three-part program that Sarah's
going to outline for us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we were looking back at our grant,
we kind of split it up into three main
[SPEAKER_01]: problems or topic areas that we were kind
of experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first is horticulture learning
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We realized we were kind of falling into a
routine, and we wanted to make sure we
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting the most out of this learning
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is exploring public and
purposeful mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have this beautiful mission
statement, but we weren't utilizing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we weren't necessarily following it to
its most capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third part is a leadership model
alteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we realized that the way our leadership
model was set up, we weren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing each other, and the work wasn't
being distributed accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we're going to kind of explain
this grant and our processes is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start by telling you about what
problems we're facing and then how we
[SPEAKER_01]: address it through the grant, followed by
the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going well?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we still working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the first part,
which is the new horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at this through the lens of
plant sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big things that Hortus Forum
does is we have two greenhouse bays up at
[SPEAKER_00]: KPL Greenhouses, where we produce a whole
bunch of different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the problems that we have with
producing these plants is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: selling to a flooded market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have people who are buying the
same plants over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we're only doing sales at three
different locations, we see the same
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only make so much money out of man
lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a lack of learning
opportunity with the same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole bunch of begonias and a
whole bunch of snake plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, we just divide them or do leaf
cuttings from them, and we do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets very monotonous, and we're not
really expanding our learning
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really paying attention to
what our consumers need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're operating as like a club business
for fundraising, we should also know what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're selling to who we're selling and why
we're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our steps towards improvement through
the grant, we decided to consolidate and
[SPEAKER_00]: transition one of the two of our
greenhouse bays into a spring vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: starter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method had us take our separate
succulent house and tropical house,
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them into one, and make sure that
our practices were on point so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all combined, sterilizing this
newly opened house, and then replacing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeded vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds is a new opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we started to step in rather than a
leaf cutting or division propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this, we had an opportunity to
learn about the growing of vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, bedding plants, and then hanging
baskets through a donation with Dr. Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we actually could expand our
market to the greater Ithaca community and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just students.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these pictures that you see were taken
by Hortus Forum members in our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or later on, we'll see some pictures from
Steve Reyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So positive outcomes of doing this change
in the sale perspective is that we learned
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow a wider variety of plants in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It expanded our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bedding plants and vegetables,
you're not really going to be selling to
[SPEAKER_00]: students here or here for only a semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We geared more towards the Ithaca
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to send out publications and to
staff so they could have gardens over the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We increased our membership participation
with many projects by sending out emails
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, this is a new opportunity that you
can get involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hands on and it's going to take a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we had a connection to
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't just selling a house plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were selling something that they could
use for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a very good impact on our club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the learning opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really want to say negatives
throughout this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just something that we can work
towards in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sale timing and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sowed our seeds too early and we ended
up having tomatoes that were almost four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to put individual labels in each
four inch pot was extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to have some leaning plants tip
over, entire flats flip onto the floor and
[SPEAKER_00]: have to throw those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sale time actually conflicted with the
Ithaca garden sale downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to pull the same type of
consumers from Ithaca who've been going
[SPEAKER_00]: there for years up to our greenhouses at
KPL, which is still kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe how to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also didn't budget and how much plants
to produce and kind of match it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in coming next years, we're going to
have to definitely evaluate how much we
[SPEAKER_00]: had left over and how much we should
actually sow for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked about our growing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a really warm greenhouse and
the tomatoes liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of just perpetuated our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not use any sprays when we were
growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a lot of beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have a lot of leaf covers,
cover and dense planting, it just
[SPEAKER_00]: increases pest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward to our next steps,
we will be doing a spring sale next
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to tweak how what varieties we
use and how much we're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to seed them at the right
time, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use Neil Mattson and we're going to use
them again as a resource and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better outcome for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to look for a new
sale opportunity position.
[SPEAKER_00]: KPL greenhouses, as I mentioned,
was hard to get to livestock position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pavilion has an actual address that we can
send to consumers to say, come here to the
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock pavilion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part of our grant really
focuses on exploring public and purposeful
[SPEAKER_01]: mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we have this club and we love
plants and we want to share that love with
[SPEAKER_01]: others, we were still kind of struggling
to find good meaning and to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning match our actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the existing problems again,
are just embodying our mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of cultivating a positive social
community, which fosters a passion for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and teaches the value of
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were often finding that we were profit
driven, but we wanted to be philanthropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of finding a good balance
and also motivating our members to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: same vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through the grant, we wanted to work
with Geneva Community Gardens to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: transplants, vegetable transplants for
that program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also reached out to Cal's department to
find experts in different fields and to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that we were building our
knowledge and our skill sets accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reached out to Professor Perosio to
talk about marketing and how we want
[SPEAKER_01]: others to see our club and what we want
our club brand to be, just as one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also hosted a Cal's wide workshop on
community gardens with Fiona Doherty,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Steve Reiner and Dr. Christine Smart,
who were able to talk to us as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal's members and other students and
faculty and staff about how important
[SPEAKER_01]: community gardens are and what
opportunities we have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that were really positive,
Cynthia and I, you can see us there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right, we went to the giveaway day in May
and it was really excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so humbling and great to see
community members really excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants and asking great questions
about how to grow them and how to care for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at producing their own
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants were distributed to a dozen
community gardens around Geneva and of
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 pounds of fresh produce that was
produced throughout Geneva, approximately
[SPEAKER_01]: half was grown from hortiform plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for a first year program,
that's really exciting to know that our
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts here in Cornell can make a big
impact elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some challenges we faced was that our
giveaway day was a same day as our bedding
[SPEAKER_01]: plant sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were kind of struggling to find the
students to go to the giveaway day and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was hard to recruit student participants
overall about volunteering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people like the idea, but during
final exam period and throughout school,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's busy and everyone's stressed
and it's sometimes difficult to find ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to motivate people to follow through and
just getting people there to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting and how worthwhile this project
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, we would love to do
another giveaway day, maybe even having
[SPEAKER_01]: more giveaway days and sending different
students on different days to different
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way we can increase our impact and
also get more club members excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also looking for opportunities for
community impact, looking at different
[SPEAKER_01]: community gardens, looking at different
places where we can distribute our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: or looking for different niches where we
can grow different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which also ties back into our learning
potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the most complicated part of our
grant writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually got a specific type of
Engaged Cornell grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under the leadership branch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original leadership model that we have
is one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our new proposed kind of hybrid variety of
leadership model is another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to explain it the best that I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions during this
point, feel free to raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problems that we had with our
existing model of leadership is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a vertical hierarchical leadership
model where we had a president,
[SPEAKER_00]: a vice president, a secretary and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an uneven distribution of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some officers really wouldn't be there
unless it was super needed for them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there and others would be there 100% of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an unclear and overlapping job
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, one of the things that we had
is who's going to post on social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the secretary's job or is that the
webmaster's job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we have a club of officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a core group of students who we find
always at the greenhouse or always at our
[SPEAKER_00]: sales that we have a listserv that's over
100 members long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to evaluate like how are we
going to include the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Steps towards improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a horizontal leadership model
instead of a vertical model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a whole new sales position that
would cater towards that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: position's needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we added consulting advisors like
Marsha mentioned in the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added Leah, Dr. Madsen and Dr. Lam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now a visual so you can see what the
original hierarchical leadership model
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four greenhouse workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually two of them are the head
greenhouse managers and then two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are apprentices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we hope that the apprentices would
take on the greenhouse manager position in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's not always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main problems that we find with
this is that there's no clear connection
[SPEAKER_00]: with who's interacting with our members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all these positions but no real
direction and where to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our horizontal leadership model,
we tried to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created work teams instead of just
positions so that we have a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to our members.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see now that we have the sales
treasurer position on the far right,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also have the greenhouse webmaster
public relations treasurer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under that whole umbrella is the
president position who's more acting like
[SPEAKER_00]: a CEO, asking to make sure that all of the
working groups are doing what needs to get
[SPEAKER_00]: done and that they're actually staying on
top of their tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any point in my position as the
president, I can step in and help another
[SPEAKER_00]: group out, but it's not really my main
responsibility as much as the team and the
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positives that we've had for this is that
we've had an improvement in the task
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now clear expectations on what
working team is supposed to do what.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've strengthened our knowledge base
through new faculty connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can draw on different specialties that
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Mattson has all of this greenhouse
production knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we're going to be calling on Dr.
Lam for IPM in the greenhouse for the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have more member inclusiveness
fostered through this explicit connection
[SPEAKER_00]: with working groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now sending out signups that say if
you want to work with Maya, our sales
[SPEAKER_00]: treasurer who's doing marketing and sales
organization, sign up and connect with
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to come up in like two
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hold on to that thought,
I will get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our learning opportunities is the
struggle with involvement of the balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: credit, volunteering, and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have students who we're still seeing or
just touch and go when it comes to events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says free on it, they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says work on it, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to incorporate this whole
thing of like you can get something if you
[SPEAKER_00]: put something in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to say that in a very nice
way so that we're not saying that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory for you to be in this club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the accountability and
transparency that comes with these officer
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five new five explained expanded
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now all of those positions need to
work together with each other to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that that overlap is not going to happen
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transparency is coming because Marsha
is requiring us to do bi-weekly updates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which help everybody in the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying like what officer is doing
what for that coming week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward, we know that this is a
workable model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not set in stone yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just transitioned into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that all of our problems
are solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be malleable for the future
outlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem that we had that Don just
mentioned was that we're not motivating
[SPEAKER_00]: members to join these working teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we supposed to do that if we're
having problems getting them to show up to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our meetings?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to include a top-down
enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have working teams and I'm trying to
encourage them to reach out to members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more than a net ID and have them show
your face at a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show your face at a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, hello, my name is Hawk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the president.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to work with me on this
project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually getting your voice out there and
making that personal connection to the
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening 100% now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a dream up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to pin it down for next
semester, which is going to happen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely for this fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just beyond the grant, we've been
having a lot of success in other areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: our club.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been more excited about finding new
ideas for club meetings before we are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuck in these routines of doing the
same activities every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these new changes has kind of
sparked some inspiration for new ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been really excited about doing more
community events, such as the succulent
[SPEAKER_01]: planter that was given to President
Pollack and Dean Boer, which we had
[SPEAKER_01]: students on the Arts Quad help to plant
such planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out really great,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to host more intentional free
community activities to continue to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the community engaged and to keep our
members engaged as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making new club partnerships and
outreaching to the public and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're not just falling into a
routine, but we're really pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves to be active in the community
and to be working with other groups to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that we are getting the most out
of this experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like to give a huge thank you to
Engaged Cornell for sponsoring this grant
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of our projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like to thank our advisor,
Marsha Eam Sheaveley, who's been with us
[SPEAKER_01]: every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Reiners, Dr. Smart, Fiona Doherty for
helping us with all of the community
[SPEAKER_01]: garden work, as well as Kevin,
who is now a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was an undergraduate member and
he's always around and he takes great
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and he's really fun and was a
great help for this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like to thank everyone else
who's been there with us throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: way and everyone who supports our club.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the trade-offs about more
horizontal management structures is harder
[SPEAKER_05]: to make decisions because more people are
involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you found that to be true and how
have you dealt with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I have a very strong opinion when
it comes to making decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My philosophy is that if you think of the
idea, you can also think of a way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone, for example, comes up with
me with the idea saying, oh, it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: idea to have business cards, I'm like,
that is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maya is doing sales and you can hand out
business cards there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you collaborate with Maya and
make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very much so like it's either a
yes, we can try to do it, but what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we work to fix it before we start
rolling with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I usually hold the person who comes up
with the idea accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, what did the Engage
Cornell grant provide you in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: resources and people that you could
interact with for financial?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the problems that we've had is
the money struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're profit-motivated, sometimes we
always don't want to spend our own money
[SPEAKER_00]: to do stuff, especially when we have trips
and things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engage Cornell gave us an opportunity to
kind of take that weight off our shoulders
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this community donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid for plant materials,
the growing time in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also some of the outreach stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did printing for the plant varieties
when we gave away the plants and said what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually only used a quarter of the
funding that we requested because we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of faculty donations to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah, in the previous slide, you
mentioned that you're seeking new
collaborations and partnerships.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's quite a few students here who are
part of SOHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any efforts to collaborate
between ORDIS and SOHO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, from our experience,
there hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's definitely a space and a void
that needs to be filled because we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the same goals, and we want to do
the same things, and we're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But absolutely, that's definitely a space
that needs to be filled in the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys had a sale or a hands-on
activity last semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have apples, you have plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be a good friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other partnerships that we're
looking into is the Nature RX and Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Mines Matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very strong push these days are going to
be that plant and human well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a meeting on Wednesday with
somebody from Nature RX that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll offer one more shout-out for ORDIS
Forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Carol James able to join us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think she's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say that we're thinking
about this in the context of horticulture
[SPEAKER_03]: and CALS.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you imagine the hundreds and
hundreds of clubs on campus, the issues
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're describing of a vertical
leadership model and moving to a shared
[SPEAKER_03]: leadership model is something that so many
clubs are struggling with on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have the eye of the
university in terms of watching the way
[SPEAKER_03]: this is unfolding because it could serve
as a university model as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just one more shout-out to the way
in which they're moving forward and
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly serving.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different form of public purpose to
have people looking at you as a model.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just really pleased from that
perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that Cornell is kind of
falling short on is participation in
[SPEAKER_05]: national meetings like ASHS.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys had a chance to go there.
Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the opportunity there for
undergraduate involvement.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you're going forward, are you thinking
about maybe expanding the vision for what
[SPEAKER_05]: ORDIS Forum can do and maybe increase
participation in those sorts of things and
[SPEAKER_05]: increase visibility of Cornell nationally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hawk and I had the opportunity to go to
the ASHS conference in Hawaii this fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked a lot about that,
how our club doesn't really seek
[SPEAKER_01]: professional event opportunities per se
and how it would be so great to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: students to events like that where we can
make professional connections and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about the research and horticulture that's
going on across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely an opportunity,
maybe even through the next big travel
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity that comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's definitely a direction that
we've been thinking about and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do run into the problem, though,
is that we're a widespread club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have students who are not just in
plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people who are engineers,
communication majors, and some even all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down in arts and sciences for
InfoSci.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we try to just allocate our own
funding to that specific of an event,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of leaves out all of those other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like, even if you're
working sales, you might not get a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the funding towards what you
want to do because ASHS is very heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: plant science research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's maybe not so applicable to an
InfoScience person or a comm person in
[SPEAKER_00]: their direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: SAFC funding is going to become a good
friend to us hopefully next semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help us with a lot more of
the local trips that we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going down to the Philadelphia
Flower Show, SAFC funding can help with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the transportation, kind of
lighten that cost load.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your next year's meeting is in
Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transportation costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to do Washington,
DC than Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also consider the regional meetings,
which are sometimes more student-oriented
[SPEAKER_04]: than the national meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a lot of student programs,
or have had in the past, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would look at those because they may
have things that are of interest to people
[SPEAKER_04]: who are not in horticulture because
they've got they may have judging or some
[SPEAKER_04]: other things that people find interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some other meetings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're adding Dr. Lam
because we do have an ignorance about
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's not going on around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the community engagement component
of what you've done in the past year was
supported by this Engage Cornell grant,
can that become a sustainable each year
[SPEAKER_00]: activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our grant, we actually wrote that we
were having the sale the same time as like
[SPEAKER_00]: the donation, so that that sale would
perpetuate the funding for the donation
[SPEAKER_00]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we're going to still
continue with some of the practices that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're undertaking a new leaf, we're not
going to require any funding next year for
[SPEAKER_00]: it because we had that startup capital
upfront to do all the plants for the sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Marcia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as two unusually forthright and strong
officers, I mean, each of you has
[SPEAKER_03]: contributed so much in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts about how you can
ensure a continuation of this kind of ESTJ
[SPEAKER_03]: forthright energy that you're bringing to
the you know, really like what can you do
[SPEAKER_03]: in the spring semester to ensure that this
positive strong leadership continues?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely looked into some new
programs that are like online to help with
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of organization of the club
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going to start doing the whole
top down enthusiasm push.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have those working teams and we
can actually see those working teams
[SPEAKER_00]: function, it might be more of a
motivational aspect for our officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that we can have a good
reflection at the end of the fall
[SPEAKER_00]: semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our next meeting is the end of
this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to actually talk about what
we're going to do for the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a little bit different from
this fall semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's still evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to be malleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a personal thing for me, I can stand up
here and say like, we can do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do this, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like in any educational system,
if the people who are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement it don't enact it, it's not
going to catch it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the fears that we have
thought about while writing this grant is
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do this for the duration of the
grant and said that we did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is it going to be sustainable after we
leave?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the problem that we have a lot
of seniors as officers and people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing it for continuous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard that Sarah was an officer for
two years before she didn't do it this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an officer for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be here next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some people who are younger
officers who will take over hopefully next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to cultivate more people
who are either freshmen or sophomores to
[SPEAKER_00]: join the club and kind of take that
leadership initiative in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully train them in the way that we
want them to act.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a question from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, the two of you
coordinated the presentation really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is about public outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does any of your current public outreach
involve science outreach to school systems
[SPEAKER_02]: or is that among the list of things you've
considered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our outreach is trying to be a step
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been invited into school programs
before trying to do just like a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about how you grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's never been a strong
component just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the ideas was, hey,
wouldn't it be cool if... The outreach
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is held strong by some of our
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like myself and then the current
greenhouse grower manager, Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that we're trying to
look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have connections from anybody in the
audience that would like to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach with us, let us know and we'll be
able to partner with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, Sarah, Hawk, thank you both for a
wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
