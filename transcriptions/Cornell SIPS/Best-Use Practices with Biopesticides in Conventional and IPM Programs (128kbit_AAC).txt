[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to, I'm Matt Krauss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Krauss from BioWorks and R&D for
BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleague, at the age of along with
Sanders, probably many of you have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: her at these types of companies here in
New York State quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start out, we just wanted to
introduce you to, for those of you who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know BioWorks, we're a small
company, located out south of Rochester in
[SPEAKER_01]: Victor, New York, and we distribute plant
protection and plant nutrition products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are on the list, and we go
from Canada, the U.S., and down into
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the, I think we've a great
advantage now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have products we own, and the owners
are still in the upper management of the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're working right alongside of us,
hearing our comments, paying attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: most of our comments, and they're with a
hands-on approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just investors, they're
actually investors.
The added feature is that they're
off-spring at Cornell University.
The company?
Yes.
Yeah.
I am too.
Me and the other hand went to another
university that's close by here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start out, a lot of two-slit,
one to consider about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a question that we've been asking
for many, many years, and to highlight
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the points is really important,
and that I think the person that turns the
[SPEAKER_01]: head on parole is the low REI and the low
PHI, and the use of it is entry-level,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would be hard for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes it easier in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another part is that it's more much
better for your working environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the workers have been expressing
concern for safety issues, and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: come in with these products that have a
lower REI and PHI, it gives a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: safety which can be discerned when those
products are being applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all have experienced,
it is difficult to be real stringent on
[SPEAKER_01]: safety and ease for the workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have these products that are
more friendly to the working environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just makes it more relaxing where
you're working in.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are simple, and they are
also becoming more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect that you can use as a
selling tool is to integrate these
[SPEAKER_01]: products into your spray program so you
can avoid developing resistance to your
[SPEAKER_01]: pests and to your disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the biopesticides that are on the
market already have multiple loads of
[SPEAKER_00]: action, so they're less likely to develop
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the mechanisms that you might be
familiar with or might have heard before
[SPEAKER_00]: are competitive exclusion, rise sphere,
incompetence, induced central resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: predation, or parasympathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of those are kind of brute force
types of mechanisms that are not based on
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular, disrupting a particular kind
of pathway in the pathogens or insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also want to make note that many
times on the especially in rotation or in
[SPEAKER_01]: tankiness, the biologists can enhance the
efficacy of chemists groups that are
[SPEAKER_01]: having the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are oftentimes a cost-effective
control to these, meaning that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticides women first looked at by the
accountants and a lot of the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, the first thing they look at
is, okay, cost too much, way more than the
[SPEAKER_01]: other genital terms we think we should
consider using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you really think about all of the
instances you've worked in, and instances
[SPEAKER_01]: you've worked for, so we're getting to
some of these data, it also, many of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the product that I'm most
familiar with, the pre-shields group for
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling damping off organisms,
you can have a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, when you're putting the
biological back into the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, it's just enhancing the
overall biology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the consumers can understand
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the big explosion over the last few
weeks that the consumers are aware of what
[SPEAKER_01]: is healthy and not healthy, but when we
get into some of the more details on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow your plants and the biology,
it's where humans can appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we find out when we first approach the
conventional grow, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: work as well as synthetic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not compatible with the synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have pre-shields, but all of
these are just proven when you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk with the representatives of the
companies for the biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest one that we find, even at the
retail consumer level, is that don't cause
[SPEAKER_01]: fibro-tex.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA listing, even though it can cause
the fibro-tex, it's all in how you view
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do they really do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, they suppress a lot of
the plant diseases and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do not just try to wipe
motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes them so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really they're, to carry that theme on,
they're really effective at low to
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate disease or pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, we don't want that
explosion to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about curative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about products that are
meant to be used to help you manage the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole ecology around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really how we have to think about
using bio-pesticides on predators and
[SPEAKER_00]: predators as we approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also provide the benefits,
their side benefits, not just giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: a nicer environment for your plants to be
in, a greenhouse and a safer environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for your employees to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some of the microbial
bio-pesticides that actually do some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effects on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of, for example, Root Shield
Plus, for instance, and Root Shield,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the fungi that are in those
formulations can also help to make
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients more available to the plant,
especially micronutrients, iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum, phosphorus, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they don't do is offer 100%
protection, and we've alluded to that
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but let's keep in mind that there
aren't any pesticides technically that
[SPEAKER_00]: offer 100% protection either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the fungicides in your
cabinet or in your pesticide room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got one for phytophthora,
you've got one for rhizotonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got one for spirulina, you've got
one for phytonites, you've got one for
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not offering you broad-spectrum
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the bio-pesticides can actually
provide support for multiple pathogens or
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple insect pests, but quite frankly,
none of them offer 100% protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: even against a single pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cases where we see trials being
done for IR4 or for other research
[SPEAKER_00]: programs nationally and internationally,
where we just have to see failures of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most reliable products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that is due to resistance being
built up to a chemical pesticide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in other cases, it's all about the
timing and all about the right
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of the bio-pesticides that are on
the market are actually cure diseases or
[SPEAKER_00]: cure pest issues that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of maybe a couple that can
be used as curatives for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the example of Milstock for that,
but I think by and large, most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products are prevented.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't work in environmental
instruments, especially the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the living products,
because they're not a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are living organisms, so when it's
too cold or when it's too hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: they slow down their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really too hot, you could possibly
kill them as well, which would require
[SPEAKER_00]: re-optication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't work at high disease or
pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't last indefinitely, and I mean
that in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have very defined shelf
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are still living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, they will complete their own
energy and nutrient reserves with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: using the example of enthmocathogenic
nematodes, like styreneina, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no mouth parts, so you are
really relying upon their own fat stores
[SPEAKER_00]: there to keep them going, and that's why
you keep them refrigerated to slow down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tablets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you pull them out of the shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't find the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also may require more frequent
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some products will require that,
especially when you're applying to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fold, since they are not systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: By and large, you need to be able to treat
new plant tissue with them, since they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't live as fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely don't make it that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing magical about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not silver bullets by any stretch
of the word, although we get comments from
[SPEAKER_00]: our colleagues in the biofesticide
industry, they get comments all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: about, look at the stick in my plant and
not have to worry about this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pest or this particular issue because I
use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you're not using good,
complete IPM practices, which include
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and sanitation, et cetera,
from the very beginning of the production
[SPEAKER_00]: process throughout your production,
if you're really a dirty grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not paying attention to the
overall needs of the plant, these products
[SPEAKER_00]: won't help you at all.
Next, we're going to move on to general
pest use practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what you've probably heard
before, but we find that it's very helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: to drill into key concerning little
reminders as to some of the ways that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can really alter the environment or the
growing conditions that would go against
[SPEAKER_01]: the development of disease or your pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Clair brought up a good example,
although we didn't include it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about the disease problem,
where you have the host, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, and you have the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can knock out any one of those
legs there is the opportunity to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact of disease and even the insect
like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to go on from that is to understand
what the disease is that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to combat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is to understand the life cycle
of the pest that you're bringing in or
[SPEAKER_01]: that is showing up in your production
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going back to the basic biology
of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being proactive is really important
because in any use of biological to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to protect yourself or your joints or
your paracetalias, you have to start with
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, select the right product for your
disease or pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes without saying, but sometimes
you'll get a girl who comes in too quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: and will ruin another product that may
have the same life cycle, but it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: under a different name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reading the label becomes really
important there for selecting the right
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can say a million times but we get
growers who still have an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get one who wasn't very nice about one
of our products, only to find out that
[SPEAKER_01]: they applied four times the highest level
rate and still expected us to cover the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of the production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just from being the insider into the
development of new products, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those that label for a lot of good reasons
is no different than the instruction
[SPEAKER_01]: manual when we get a put together item at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you have any questions
to all the suppliers, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors, I know we have many kind of
normals, everybody else does because we
[SPEAKER_01]: realize questions can arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just selecting what works
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other product where the radical cowl
is probably better under some growing
[SPEAKER_01]: condition as opposed to the emulsified
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that can be
identified once you have experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only a distributor but back to the
actual content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the formulation issues really
are built around what your needs are as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what you're capable of doing,
what makes economic sense for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may choose a granular product to be
re-incorporated into your growing medium
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's more difficult for you to go
in afterwards and do a branch application
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of these biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there is a softer formulation,
we'll use the example of the Tanagard ES.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tanagard ES is a very awesome product
for controlling haphids, white fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES formulation can be harsh on some
varieties of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a leadable powder formulation
that's also available of the Tanagard
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Tanagard 22WP that can be used
in place of the Tanagard ES and still
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you the same level of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's less detrimental to those very
sensitive varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, we really strongly suggest
that whenever you're considering coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into changing any product within your test
management program, that you try that on a
[SPEAKER_01]: small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: To become smooth, responsive, active,
and know the greenhouse setting in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fields if you so choose to go in your
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important just to make sure you
know your equipment the right way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: expect it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends up in the working environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have a comparison to what
you are familiar with and what is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any difference in the way
that you'd like to investigate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we highly recommend that when you do
try out biologics for the first time or a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological for the first time,
that you try to integrate it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: program with what you're currently doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than going in and doing it out like
you're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just doing it on a small scale,
but really familiarizing yourself with
[SPEAKER_00]: that product and seeing what it can do for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least getting advice from other
growers or from the companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: providing these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very important because you're
basically bringing a new organism into
[SPEAKER_01]: your production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like if you're bringing in a new
crop and a variety of totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say like I own into your
lineup and a variety of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to get to know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people sometimes forget
when they're first working in biological
[SPEAKER_01]: is that you are working with a new
organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get to know that new organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to have likes and
dislikes as anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a new crop and you have to
come to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Application is really important that goes
without saying with any type of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the right equipment for the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: The example we use is that many of the
chemicals can take a high temperature type
[SPEAKER_01]: of application where something like an
auto product will have a lower temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and will not on its course going through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just how to apply and when to
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they connect differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different, some of them have
really more stringent environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's raising hands here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people calibrated their spray
book in the last six months?
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrating is not just important for
getting the product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also dangerous on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not calibrating your spray
book, you could be throwing money down
[SPEAKER_00]: your drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you are using biologicals
which tend to be per application a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more expensive when you're spraying
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very important that you're
calibrating your spray book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you're changing nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nozzles wear and there can be
change in the spray pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change in the profit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not operating under the
right pressure, et cetera, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: really be actually wasting a lot of money
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again you're working with a
biological, there are limitations to
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to make sure it's stored
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most biologicals cannot take the higher
extremes of temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them cannot take the freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it's due to their formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily due to organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to be more aware of what the
storage conditions are for successful
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: By and large most biologicals that you're
using will definitely do better if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in a refrigerated setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do not tolerate freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many do not tolerate temperatures
higher than 50 or 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or their shelf lives are compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a much shorter shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another time saving aspect to using
biologicals or any production aspect is
[SPEAKER_01]: just the tank mixing compatibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a question you may see a lot with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because growers like to just save time
which we all can certainly respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them especially come in with
fungicides and insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're using a bioinsecticide that's
100% of the base of the fungus base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you need to be able to know if you
can take them successfully or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just taking one that's going to be killing
off the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there those of you who are interested
in or are currently using predators and
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even some of you that may have
pollinators in your greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important you can still use many
of the biologicals compatible with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may cause you to look at the actual
application time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spraying these products before you do a
new release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because something we didn't talk about
here is that there usually aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: residues left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: After spraying these a lot of these
biologicals are contact materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that as long as you're not
applying let's say during the period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time when for instance bumblebees are
active in foraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to worry about
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of how biology supports
that aspect to a grower's production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have available online on our website
the comparability for many of our products
[SPEAKER_01]: in a team mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one is the botanica which is a
very nice sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of fungus a lot of growers do
like to mix from inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone through and done many tests
on how some of these are biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: compatible with some of our biological
theory to better germinate and penetrate
[SPEAKER_01]: on the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on their own we'll have some of our
competitions on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will just be open to the needs of
the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So use the comparability to your
advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the aspects that is gaining a lot
of popularity as you have a biological
[SPEAKER_01]: control exposure going on with the mites
is the use of dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a dip is taking a fungicide and an
insecticide, bio fungicide, bio
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticide, and totally immersing your
incoming plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by doing it this way you're
totally covering and you're diminishing
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers that you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in a biological program you want
to start low, you want to start the venom
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a dip sheet on our website
to actually study the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: antipodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something for some of our workers,
but really it's the products that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these principles certainly are
applicable to other biologicals out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, certainly it's something to
consider, especially with the people using
[SPEAKER_01]: NWBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to start low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact we have a grower, a co-chart,
one of our technical sales managers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a pair of braces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a real pain in the butt to be doing
these dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time May came around,
when the grower had a lot less time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grower was doing fewer sprays than
when he had traditionally not been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: them until years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did dip dipping on his incoming
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just thinking about stepping down a few
hundred thousand bricks and getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: repotting, what they impact when you're
doing a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so tank mixing not only supplies the
dips, but also the sprays that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing for wrenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stacking materials in there,
compatible materials that save time and
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also take advantage of co-worker
MRIs during that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are other types of
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if two materials aren't compatible and
tank together, there are many
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for you to apply them
separately, usually within a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: window, a day to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when you go further and there's a
fundus side that you want to use just as
[SPEAKER_00]: an initial hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On some plank materials that you know
already has Rhizoc or Pythium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you still want to be able to use a
microbial that isn't compatible with that
[SPEAKER_00]: fundus side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can come back two weeks later and
be able to use a biological and still have
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect and not have to worry about
disrupting the protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes without saying that just by
alternating the mode of action,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are eliminating and reducing the
capability of developing a resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a pest or disease coming
in, you would not be
[SPEAKER_01]: to the pest or disease coming into your
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you choose the same product that
it's been applying for the prior five
[SPEAKER_01]: months, you may be entering into a
challenge with that way that you'd rather
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by using your biological, you're mixing
up your program and therefore giving
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself a much better opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing this right now with the
Tritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plank material coming in from
offshore and from the southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has come up into the mid-Atlantic and
into the northeast and the mid-west this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where many other conventional chemistries
are not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Against that, that's an experience with
some of the biologicals from our company
[SPEAKER_00]: and from other companies that have
actually made a dent and have helped to
[SPEAKER_00]: break out that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least giving a few weeks of delay,
which is enough to allow those fundusides
[SPEAKER_00]: to gain back their accuracy and potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been very, very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at reducing the chemical
inputs in your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, especially if you're trying to
improve, you can become a softer grower
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can preserve the chemistries
for when you actually need them and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be a lot more effective because
you have chemical systems built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see, and you can talk to
anybody that's been doing biopatrol or
[SPEAKER_00]: been using biopatrols in their programs
for a few years or more, that their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually are a little healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what a lot of people don't realize
is that the chemistries that you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: do have an impact on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not see outright phytotoxicity or
outright plant injury, but we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are fundusides and insecticides that
disrupt certain plant functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that uses thiopanate knuckle,
T-knuckle, as a funduside should know that
[SPEAKER_00]: T-knuckle can actually inhibit root hair
formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's affecting the plant's ability to
take up root roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can minimize those types of
impacts, and especially with the systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that are out there, you're
actually going to create a healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: environment around that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to have microbes that
are in those environments that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually support the biologicals that
you're using as well as the chemicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using because they're supporting
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible also to use the chemistries
in conjunction with the biologicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: help take care of problems with incoming
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very common practice that has been
around since RootShield even came into the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace is, for instance, anybody
that's bringing in rooted poinsettia
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings from offshore especially,
we have a lot of growers that will do a
[SPEAKER_00]: tanker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subdue Max and RootShield or RootShield
Plus, when they get that plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: in, they'll treat their products with that
or their root cuttings with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll also treat the plant
material that's been transplanted into
[SPEAKER_00]: their growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get the quick knockdown of the
fifth one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get the longer lasting
effect of the RootShield and RootShield
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually is limited to one
application for the entire season of one
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and two to three applications
for an entire growing season for
[SPEAKER_00]: poinsettia with, for instance,
RootShield Plus or RootShield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also works with some of the other
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in the end, you can
actually have increased efficacy as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as cost efficiency if you're willing to
talk about that in a few moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Amanda's done is she's developed
some programs just to get you thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's going to be reviewing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to be disease-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the principles are right there for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different ways to come
about in creating or changing your
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, these are going to give you
some thoughts as to how you might be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the next step in your programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so very quickly, for collier
programs, again, we're talking for
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits use control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just using a biological program,
you're not bringing in necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would do an initial spray
application, either a single material or a
[SPEAKER_00]: tank mix of multiple biologics in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would do repeat applications
every five to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you want to do that, not just to
update what's already on the collier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these, again, are really,
for the surface, they're not systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also want to introduce that
material to new plant growth that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would want to do that when you
have the first two leaves or when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing a rotation-type program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're looking at what I just said
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're introducing chemistries
within that program too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can keep a good rotation
going and minimize resistance buildup to
[SPEAKER_00]: your chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, what's very
interesting, and a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_00]: consider, but you can be doing a
biofesticides spray right before harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: and right before shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the biofesticides that are on the
market today have a four-hour or less REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get right out there and work
with the plants without having to dumb the
[SPEAKER_00]: PPE, protective equipment PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also providing something that
can last during the shipping of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, as well as, in some cases,
by going to the end user or the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center where you're typically going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that the chemistries
can't really allow you to do unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a day or two of a head application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you a tomato greenhouse here,
a greenhouse hydroponic operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the largest in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 48-year greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is, for their foliar program,
they use two biological insecticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: two foliar fungicides, and they're
biological fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products they're using are dye panel
and a botanical guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're also using for insect
control, and they're using cease and mill
[SPEAKER_00]: stop for foliar disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started out only integrating those
individually into their kind of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their customers influenced them,
but they also saw that there was an added
[SPEAKER_00]: value to them of being able to get out
into the greenhouse with low REIs and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest every day, as opposed to
harvesting every other day, which meant
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was less fruit left on the vine
or less fruit that was going out and
[SPEAKER_00]: degrading during transport or storage at
the food distribution warehouse or at the
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this also afforded them was the
ability to do all of these applications
[SPEAKER_00]: stack more products into there because
they were more compatible and safer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is very important to them as
well, because they have 120 miles of spray
[SPEAKER_00]: rack in their greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their spray rack, it's a robot sprayer
that goes through and gets everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes through that 40 acres in five
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to have products that are
compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very concerned about
pesticide residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a program that works for them,
and it makes economic sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually not necessarily
rewarded in the marketplace for it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're selling it to hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling it to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling it to Costco, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is is that they have a
product that has a better shelf life and
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually fresher because the people can
get out into the greenhouse and work more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly than having to wait through an REI
or having to go on a spray suit to get out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what those tomatoes
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see very clean spots, and these are
TOB type tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about halfway through the
production of those particular levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to look very closely on
those, you still wouldn't see a spot or a
[SPEAKER_00]: speck or a pest in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for soil and water disease programs,
they really involve wrenching or pre-plant
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporation of a biological for disease
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be applied whether it's at
seeding or sticking or transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing transplants, as Debbie
mentioned before, transplant dips are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, too, just so you can get a head
start if the prior grower of your pulp
[SPEAKER_00]: material hasn't been using biological.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a similar strategy applies to what we
would see in the fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although these types of applications of
the soil corn or the soil fungicide and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil insecticides tend to last longer than
those on the fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get by with two to,
let's say, 10 weeks between applications
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned earlier about the
knockdown programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into any detail on that for a
lack of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have those in your focus there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a grower who does
one of those knockdown programs on a new
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material coming in as a plot for
rooting cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 100-acre member of the von
Wierden family of operations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest that uses these biological
approaches along with their chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches quite consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times involves a chemical
knockdown program at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: when they receive plant material that
they're not using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked earlier about the pro-hacket
preventer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into details on that for the
first three items for developing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really it's important upfront that you
identify what those gaps are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just use biological because you
think it's cool and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great reason to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really look at your program and see
where you have gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you missing things?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing more pitotoxicity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of injury?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having issues with getting out of
the greenhouse working with plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly so you're not wasting time
with your labor force?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there things that will make it more
convenient for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for something with safety,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really identify those gaps as you consider
using these different products and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: their fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really try to figure out how you're
going to measure those when you do want to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's all important to look at why
you're making that decision to switch it
[SPEAKER_00]: over to why you stay with that when it
comes five years from now and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the bottom line saying,
well, you know, I'm spending this much on
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only considering the cost of the
program, the economic cost, and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at all the other factors,
you may be missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really define what success looks like
based on what we saw before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because a biological is as effective
as chemicals doesn't mean that that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sometimes have growers that tell us,
you know, the biological worked just as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expect it to work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it does, sometimes many times
they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work just as effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But consider all the other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also consult with the manufacturers of
those products, other growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: extensions for advice on how you get your
program going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only put so much on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label is just a set of guidelines and
restrictions, et cetera, set forth by U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't tell you about timing of the
applications, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do is help you or provide
you with some contacts maybe with some
[SPEAKER_00]: other growers who have had success that
can walk through that with you and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you about the optimum timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum rate, et cetera, for that
particular crop or what is compatible with
[SPEAKER_00]: that and what is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot is on the label,
but there's a lot that's not on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't hesitate to reach out to us or to
your extension folks and to other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know have had success or have had
experience with by all means.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide, this is an example on our
website, you know, even the chance for you
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to call in and ask a question or
to email, but you can actually send an
[SPEAKER_00]: electronic message to us that gets to us
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually we try to respond within four
business hours to your message and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you understand what's going on and
how you might be able to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to tell you that it may not be possible
for one of our products to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also provide, as we said before,
all kinds of information about
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility, protocols that don't look
blank like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we said before, testing products on a
smaller scale before you go all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some growers that are so
enthusiastic, they race to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, you know, we saw this talk by a
butt lady, Susan Lane right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by Debbie, and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to get out there and
they're so enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can work all of their production
over to biological and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard for us to go in and help
them if you have nothing to compare it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to say what could have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a plant pathologist, Debbie's a
plant pathologist, a lot of them all have
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for us to be able to help
diagnose what the problem is if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something in there that serves as a
comparison of what your current practice
[SPEAKER_00]: is versus what you want to be in your new
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that enables us to help diagnose the
issues so that the next time you use a
[SPEAKER_00]: product, if you decide you want to use a
product, we can help you optimize and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, set up a good comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrate the resources in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of growers who have
done just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up good comparisons, usually on a
smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the bottom right photo there,
that's actually a small comparison for
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular grower out in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a quarter of an acre was a good
comparison for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth especially because they have
about 40 acres in production just at that
[SPEAKER_00]: one site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, more comparisons on a smaller
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document your tasks, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photographic at least, with and without or
this practice versus that practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep good notes because they'll also
value on what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, yeah, I don't want to use
that radio, I want to use this radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I don't want to use that equipment,
I want to use this equipment, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, that good, the other way,
can really surprise us because that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you will see if you work with
biocontrol for even the shortest period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to surprise yourself,
which leads me to the next point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also be open-minded to be looking for
the things that you're not normally
[SPEAKER_00]: looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a step back, look at the plants in a
different light.
[SPEAKER_00]: See whether you see differences there or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even bring in some other people within
your operation to see if they see any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick, quick, quickly, quickly,
decision-making considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about the actual physical
cost of the product that you're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: to each application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't discount that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will get cost in use too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the actual cost to use the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not just the cost of the
product, it's also the cost per
[SPEAKER_00]: application in terms of the product
itself, the labor, and what you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for that equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also based on the number of
applications that you need for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some of the biologicals can
be applied over a longer interval,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that you don't have to make as
many applications for the force of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you would with a conventional
fundus-side program or a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're able to, even though you
might have a higher initial cost per
[SPEAKER_00]: application of that biological,
you might actually be saving money because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're applying less frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also probably going to get
better efficacy on some of those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the number of diseases or pests
that are controlled by that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, the biologicals that go to
moderate insect or disease pressure can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide support or control of multiple
pathogens and multiple pests, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry may be limited in that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, what the actual cost or the
actual benefits of it, not just what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see as the direct costs or the direct
benefits, but really look at what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned before, being able to go
out and harvest or being able to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants without having to have a day of
waiting and clean, meaning that you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more efficiency with your workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, workers' safety is very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that growers that have more
biological or higher-intensity biological
[SPEAKER_00]: program tend to have people working for
them have fewer safety days, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really consider all of those points,
not just the actual product cost and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you see as only the financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have any time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be here for the rest of the day.
So I'm going to leave the presentation on
the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there are some quick questions
while the whole audience is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the products that you're going
to get, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have best buy date on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there'll be a date code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the package, it will tell you
how many months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for BioLux products, we always put a
best buy date on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's here for the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine that there's something on
your website at all in place?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the guidelines or tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any examples of what items might be used
as tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, it has the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, because it's a BioLux
publication, it has a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a countryside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will include minotauro rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a fertilizer that has been
made into a growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only hormones, but it just gives a
stronger effect to the organism.
Have you seen resistance, test resistance,
to any of the Bio products?
And if not, should we be concerned about
in development?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there best practices that we can
educate for them in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen, within BioWorks,
and I can speak for those of our
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues within the biofesticide
industry, we haven't seen any resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, due to multiple moments ago,
we haven't seen any action in brute force
[SPEAKER_00]: type forms of action, like soft oil acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a true biological, living
biological, but it falls under USNPA's
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of a biofesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something where there's a gene
for gene resistance that can be built on,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, we haven't seen any yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always watching for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we say, we never say,
that they're never going to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're constantly evaluating,
we're also looking at our strains to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we're producing the same
efficacy every batch, every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, so we don't seem to drift away
from efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question, you're the last thing
that's keeping us from breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, because yes,
they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a compatibility sheet
would let you know what you could use in
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part is to just do an
overall assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is detrimental, even to your BCA,
your mind, so you're a person,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have to evaluate that in your
whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it's a question that should be
asked before you go out and do a total of
[SPEAKER_01]: spray programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of use in conjunction would you
want to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would just want to look for
what's compatible with one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're going to do sequential
drenches or sequential sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lots of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our other colleagues in the
industry are saying there are still others
[SPEAKER_00]: who've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still have technical people who
can help you through it.
Thank you.
Time to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
