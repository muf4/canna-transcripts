[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks, Don, for inviting me and for
you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, thanks for your contributions to
EE capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don's going to be teaching an online
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had several grad students helping
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's in collaboration with
Chicago Botanic Gardens and American
[SPEAKER_01]: Public Gardening Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be starting in February,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: January?
[SPEAKER_01]: January.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like probably a lot of you in this
room, I actually think quite a bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like winter and cold weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always feel kind of sad when we have
those slushing events, or what we call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: ifecating events in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather see snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hadn't really done much about
climate change education professionally
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of consider myself almost as a
climate change denier, and not like a
[SPEAKER_01]: denier in that I don't believe that
climate change is occurring, but a denier
[SPEAKER_01]: in that I kept wishing that it would go
away and that somebody else would solve
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Hurricane Sandy occurred a couple
of years ago, and I was in Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I wasn't down in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the images and thinking about people I
knew going through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you know Gretchen Farins,
who recently retired from Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in Fire Rockaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just taking the brunt of the storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the media attention really made
me sort of think about climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a way it was a tipping point
for me in terms of my profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially since, as Don mentioned,
I direct EPA's National Environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: Education Training Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a large cooperative agreement with
EPA, five years, $11 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I felt like as a leader in the
field, I really needed to take more
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility than I was taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my presentation today is sort of
about my search for what we should do in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the field of environmental
education and how we should be addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know all the answers,
but I'll be talking about several projects
[SPEAKER_01]: that are helping me to find the answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should have plenty of time for
discussion at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that some of these ideas
will generate some discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you saw the images.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really kind of disturbing, scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to turn down the lights a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the way in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, East 34th Street, the Midtown
Tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was, as you know,
a lot of media attention to climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially Bloomberg, I think,
is really a leader in taking action in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of mayors nationally and
internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of knew that people are going
to rebuild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to restore sites like this
community garden before it was restored
[SPEAKER_01]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after it was restored.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is immediately after Hurricane
Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't really know how they'd
rebuild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the sort of event would make them
rebuild in different ways, if they would
[SPEAKER_01]: adapt and think about things differently
as a result of this major event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm particularly interested,
since I'm in environmental education,
[SPEAKER_01]: about interested in the learning
opportunities that occur through community
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening or through another stewardship
or civic ecology practice like this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is dune restoration after Hurricane
Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are planting dune grasses to try
and restore the dunes to protect from high
[SPEAKER_01]: water events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I talk about Hurricane Sandy
and how people reacted in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental educators, I wanted to give
you a quick primer on environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education for those of you who aren't
familiar with the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, environmental education is
about increasing knowledge and attitudes
[SPEAKER_01]: about the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also about increasing people's
ability to make informed decisions and
[SPEAKER_01]: take responsible actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a land-grant university,
we do a lot of science education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of think of our mission as
extending the science-based knowledge to
[SPEAKER_01]: the people of the state and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we more stick to science knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And environmental education also
incorporates science knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of environmental sciences
education, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we add on civic engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a very normative or
values-driven field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing this for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is to hopefully encourage
environmentally responsible behaviors and
[SPEAKER_01]: then increase environmental quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a bit different from
science education, per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple of problems with
environmental education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this one also applies to
science education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is that basically knowledge,
even though we assume that, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: if people know more about climate change,
then they'll act according to the ways
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like them to act.
[SPEAKER_01]: But knowledge doesn't necessarily lead to
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two figures are taken from a
paper by Dan Cain, who's at Yale
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at this first one,
on the y-axis, you have climate science
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much they know, how many correct
responses they get on a survey or a test
[SPEAKER_01]: about climate science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look across here, it's people's
positions on global warming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you believe your position is
that there's no warming occurring,
[SPEAKER_01]: warming is naturally caused, or warming is
human-induced, doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation with how much you know about
climate science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see this bottom graph here,
it kind of explains what does determine
[SPEAKER_01]: our positions on climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much you perceive global warming as
a risk, whether it's extremely high risk
[SPEAKER_01]: or not a risk at all, has a whole lot to
do with whether you identify yourself as a
[SPEAKER_01]: very liberal, strong Democrat,
or a very conservative, strong Republican.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has less to do, they actually have
some other graphs in this paper that show
[SPEAKER_01]: that the Republicans may have just as much
knowledge as the Democrats, but how they
[SPEAKER_01]: react is determined by our identity,
essentially, what political identity that
[SPEAKER_01]: we assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another problem with knowledge,
the assumption that knowledge leads to
[SPEAKER_01]: action, can be viewed through this lens of
terror management theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many of you know my
colleague, Janice Dickinson, she wrote a
[SPEAKER_01]: paper in 2009, it's in Ecology and
Society, and she synthesized a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of empirical studies that are going
through the lens, using the lens of terror
[SPEAKER_01]: management theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she applied that to how we think
about or how we react to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole idea here is that if I were
to tell you that global warming is
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring, it's a disaster, we're not
going to be able to produce the crops
[SPEAKER_01]: we're producing in New York State,
we're going to have droughts, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have flooding, and what's more,
we're going to have diseases, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be total devastation,
then I might make you feel vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you want to do is then make
yourself feel invincible, less vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we see this with, I apologize,
this is a little sexist, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, when they get to sort of be the
midlife crisis, they like to buy SUVs,
[SPEAKER_01]: or trucks, or nice little sport car
convertibles, they might be feeling of
[SPEAKER_01]: age, a little age-related vulnerability,
and they want to be invincible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when Sarah Palin and her colleagues,
or her supporters, you know, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting sort of bombarded by sort of
drilling in Alaska and environmentalists,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they really made themselves feel
really strong and invincible by talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about drill, baby, drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how many of you can see
this guy here, but he looks a lot to me
[SPEAKER_01]: like Vladimir Putin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know how close Russia is to
Alaska, so maybe he was there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he probably believes in drill,
baby, drill, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is this terror management
theory is that we might have reactions
[SPEAKER_01]: unintended, or people might have reactions
that we didn't intend when we tell them
[SPEAKER_01]: how bad things are, because they want to
make themselves feel less vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so another problem with
environmental education is that the type
[SPEAKER_01]: of action that environmental education
often, not always, but often sort of tries
[SPEAKER_01]: to foster is individual behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's behavior is usually, not always,
but it's often like, okay, reduce water
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're taking a shower, while you're
brushing your teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk to work instead of drive to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you consider the scale and the
magnitude is sort of the timing that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: here already, global warming, as well as
the magnitude of the issue, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a bit of a scale mismatch in some
of the behaviors that we promote and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the idea of mitigation
versus adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So environmental education has almost
totally been focused on mitigating our
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on global warming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're reducing our energy use,
we're reducing our use of plastics,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, we're recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to mitigate human impact
on climate change or on the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given what we know about climate
change that is already here, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: field really needs to think about
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the reasons I avoided
this for a long time is because for
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptations almost like you're being a
turncoat if you're an environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: educator or you're sort of giving up the
fight because you're all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that, you know, we're not just
going to try to conserve what we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're also going to face reality and adapt
to what's already happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in summary, three issues that I
think face our field of environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education and are why we need to think
about changes in our practice of
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental education or in our
discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are that knowledge doesn't
necessarily lead to behavior change,
[SPEAKER_01]: scale mismatch of the actions that we
foster or promote versus what's occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: with global warming, and then the need to
consider adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really know how we should
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I did, I like to
think of it as crowd sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three projects that I'll discuss
today that we're using to help us figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how our field might evolve or change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one is actually a research
project where we looked at New York City
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental educators who experienced
Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to talk about it's
really an outreach or extension type
[SPEAKER_01]: project, climate change, environmental
education fellows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also convened a panel of
national experts in global warming and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental education to help us
understand what they thought the field
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the first one, we looked at New
York City environmental educators after
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question we asked was,
how did their programs respond to the
[SPEAKER_01]: event to the super storm?
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of a sample of over, I think it's
about 2000 environmental stewardship
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these have been documented and mapped
by the US Forest Service, urban field
[SPEAKER_01]: station, urban research station in the
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they include everything from,
you know, major sort of policy
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations to these small scale
community gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why there's a lot and we took a
sample of 45 that we thought it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: purposeful sample that we thought were
most likely to be engaged in environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we interviewed them, open ended
interviews, conducted site visits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then analyze these open ended
responses to look at what themes might
[SPEAKER_01]: come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say that the majority of this
work was conducted by a person who works
[SPEAKER_01]: for me in New York City and his name is
Bryce Dubois.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we found two kinds of changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was in the programs, the actual
environmental education programs that
[SPEAKER_01]: people were conducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other was in the organizations
that were doing these programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to talk about the
first, the program changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were three that emerged through
these interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was that organizations or programs
were reinforcing existing content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second was that they were conducting new
types of stewardship or restoration
[SPEAKER_01]: activities and the third was that they
were incorporating this notion of
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience quite a bit into their
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example of reinforcing existing
activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Map is an organization in New York
City and they map green spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: green places around the city so that
people, if they want to visit a community
[SPEAKER_01]: garden or they want to go to Highline Park
or they want to go to another small or
[SPEAKER_01]: large park, they can kind of know where
these green spaces are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after Hurricane Sandy, they simply
imposed places that were impacted by
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Sandy on their maps and also
thought of them as opportunities where
[SPEAKER_01]: they might restore some of this green
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sort of idea of really reinforcing
what you're already doing was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think another example is a school
and it was in Queens and they had been
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching about energy for water resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they simply used Hurricane Sandy then
as examples for what they'd already been
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching about because kids were very
aware of energy since their energy was cut
[SPEAKER_01]: off sometimes for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a second type of change was new
environmental stewardship activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's with the Breezy Point Green
Committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, for those of you who know
Gretchen Farrens, this is her neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Rockaways and she was a leader of
this activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I showed another slide earlier,
but the idea of trying to restore dunes to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the impact of future high water
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we weren't really surprised that
people were engaging in these stewardship
[SPEAKER_01]: activities, not just because they think it
can protect them against a future event,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because our past research,
and this is Keith Tidball in my lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, we've seen over and over again how
after a disaster or during times of
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict, people often turn to gardening
and other forms of greening as a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more sort of their individual
psychological resilience in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, although they may also say it's
gonna bring their neighborhood or their
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as other examples, after 9-11,
we saw a lot of memorial gardens sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: spontaneously created.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might take a median strip and plant
there or take a community garden and add
[SPEAKER_01]: some daffodils to it as a memorial garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Keith worked a lot after her
experience with Hurricane Katrina in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Orleans and he found a lot of tree
planting and tree care, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent with New Orleans and the idea
of the live oaks and how important they
[SPEAKER_01]: are to the identity of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Don mentioned, we captured all that
in this, examples really from around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an edited volume, but we have
somebody from Berlin who talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: greening of the Berlin Wall after the fall
of communism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots and lots of examples of
this greening in what we call red zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the third kind of change was this
incorporation of resilience and resilience
[SPEAKER_01]: speak into these programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: UPROSE is a community organization in
Brooklyn and they created a climate
[SPEAKER_01]: justice community resilience center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then GreenMap, or excuse me,
Grow New York City, they created this
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient New York City community
gardening guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's how people can address issues like
saltwater inundation of their soils and
[SPEAKER_01]: trees falling in the middle of their
gardens and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably not surprising that
people are using this term resilience
[SPEAKER_01]: because Bloomberg actually created this
new resilience guide as part of Plan New
[SPEAKER_01]: York City, which, well, he's no longer as
mayor, but was his sustainability plan for
[SPEAKER_01]: the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also this term resilience is really
popping up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that people often don't know
what they're referring to because the term
[SPEAKER_01]: has so many different meanings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's individual or psychological
resilience, there's ecological resilience,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's engineering resilience,
and there's social ecological systems
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience, just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Bryce Dubois and I now we're
following up with some of these groups in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City to determine what they
really mean by resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in New York City giving a talk
last Friday and somebody said that the
[SPEAKER_01]: term resilience is very resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a resilience workshop last
Friday that D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soche put on in Mann Library and somebody
said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to show you how much this term is
catching on, I was reading the journal,
[SPEAKER_01]: our own Ithaca Journal this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually it's USA Today Ithaca
Journal, but anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, Hoboken, New Jersey,
Paul finds that neighborliness matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neighbor helping neighbor, trust in a
community, looking out for each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: An Associated Press NORC Center for Public
Affairs research survey suggests that
[SPEAKER_01]: those factors collectively termed social
resilience have a big impact on how
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared communities feel for disasters,
such as Superstorm Sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: 37% of residents in areas reporting high
levels of neighbors helping each other are
[SPEAKER_01]: very or extremely confident their
neighborhood would recover quickly from a
[SPEAKER_01]: disaster, compared to 22% in areas with
lower levels of neighborhood, neighborly
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they probably would have called
this social capital or social connections
[SPEAKER_01]: or something else a few years ago,
but now it's becoming social resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my question that I addressed in
this part of the talk was whether
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Sandy was really a tipping point
for environmental education and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental educators in New York City
and sort of whether it's because they
[SPEAKER_01]: stretched the limits of what they were
doing and they went over, sort of broke
[SPEAKER_01]: with what they were doing in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that the answer is
probably no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a bunch of small innovations,
but it wasn't as I sort of maybe hoped for
[SPEAKER_01]: that they came up with all the solutions
of how we should address global warming in
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn to the next project,
and this is a project that's part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: National Environmental Education Training
Program that Don mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a fellows program.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called Community Climate Change
Fellows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did, we have 26 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were selected from a group from
across the country and in Mexico and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a workshop with them for a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of this workshop and the
resources we're putting into them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're supposed to do some local
community climate change interventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, we're kind of looking for
what do these practitioners in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can we learn from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to do now is share with
you, here's just some of the fellows.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, we have 26.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to share with you a couple of
the projects they came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one's by Jason Davis, and he's in
Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came up with this idea of recording
climate change stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to play one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to ask you to think about
whether this story feels impactful to you
[SPEAKER_01]: about how you think about climate change
and whether it might move you or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even make you think differently or want to
do something differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Fred Small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the senior minister at First Parish in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, Unitarian
[SPEAKER_02]: Universalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the special places to me is the
coast of Maine, where my wife's family has
[SPEAKER_02]: had a place for generations on Penobscot
Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I have kayaked all along the
Maine coast and up off Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in New Jersey, which is not that
dissimilar a climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a Four Seasons guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the changing of the seasons that
excites me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about that cycle of
seasons that is very nourishing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading Bill McKibben's book, The End of
Nature, in 1989 was painful for me and
[SPEAKER_02]: many of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just began a decades long
season of grief so that what might have
[SPEAKER_02]: been a beautiful, sometimes called Indian
summer day, just a kind of gift like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, what a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so warm and pleasant here in October
or November or December then becomes an
[SPEAKER_02]: omen, something disturbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter is 11 and she's already said
that she wished she had been born earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: because she doesn't look forward to what
is in store for her and her generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a parent, that breaks my heart to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bad things have happened before in
human history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very bad things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The great plague in Europe, the Holocaust,
slavery, all kinds of suffering,
[SPEAKER_02]: some, if you will, natural, some
perpetrated by human depravity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't to minimize it, but to say that
we do have the capacity to get through
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think is crucial is that we've
got to do it with love and not lose our
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual center or our moral compass as
we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, as a religious leader,
the question is not, are we going to win
[SPEAKER_02]: or are we going to lose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in a sense, we've already lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've lost tremendous amounts of people
and species and good things that we will
[SPEAKER_02]: not be able to recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is not winning or losing,
but, if you will, how we play the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we stay loving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we stay compassionate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we treat each other well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we treat our enemies well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we love our enemies, as Jesus
challenged us to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could... Oops, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you all want to hear some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that he has a bunch of,
he's recorded a bunch of these climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change stories from people in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one from Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go onto his website and listen
to others if you think that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanted to play you,
this one's two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our climate change fellows,
Maria Tolero, just made a video of
[SPEAKER_01]: herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of pieces of different lectures
and she covers a lot of the points that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to show that one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a difficult topic, the topic of
climate change and maybe more specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a difficult topic because if
you think about it, there's no place to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on not the science, to work on
these human questions of how can I relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every workshop that I do is tailored for
the group that I'm presenting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want us to work together to expand
our concept of what it means to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional presentations,
I would now bombard you with the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: news imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think, oh my God,
I wish I hadn't come here this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much weight do climate change have on
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much weight do the people you're
trying to reach give to what scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What role does that play in their life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we often operate under the
assumption that everybody's ready to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: through the scientific channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a part of you that wants to
just kind of reach in and do something and
[SPEAKER_00]: do something on a scale appropriate to the
size of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business as usual is built into the very
way we perceive the world around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our social workspaces show us the world as
a place where we should preserve and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain our personal status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can change our social workspaces,
we can change our perception of reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we change our perception of
reality, our actions will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need urgently to let go of the idea
that it's the stressed, over-scheduled
[SPEAKER_00]: individual in each of us who needs to wake
up, single-handedly activate her moral
[SPEAKER_00]: conscience, step up and take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we need to look at the social
workspaces we're already sharing with
[SPEAKER_00]: others and ask, what kind of potential is
there here for transforming them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it take for you to join a
nonviolent resistance movement on climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no easy solution, but there is
something we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to argue that that something we
can do is join the movement, help create a
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful grassroots movement that moves
the needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so those are just two of our fellows,
Jason Davis and Maria Tolero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one, as I mentioned, is doing a
different project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're interested in more,
I could share with you some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to conclude this, the second project is
the question is, what is the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: each of these individual projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a way, really, we can make a
larger project through the group of
[SPEAKER_01]: fellows, along with our staff?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the EE capacity project, and we have
lots of other collaborators across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that both the video and the audio
were very impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether it makes an impact at a larger
level, I think is a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so now I'm going to go to the third
and the final project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that we convened a panel of
national experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we asked them to address the question,
is environmental education that focuses on
[SPEAKER_01]: small, individual actions, appropriate,
given the scale of climate change?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are our experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had John Carey, who's a freelance
environmental journalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Fraser, who's an environmental and
science researcher in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he works nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carey Fulton, who's with the Environmental
Justice Climate Change Initiative in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Caroline Lewis, who I think a number
of you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody knows her besides
Don.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she used to work at Fairchild Botanic
Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in Miami, and now she's started
her own organization, Climate Leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: Engagement Opportunities, or CLIO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, operating in Miami, which is ground
zero, as you probably know, of climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change and of sort of the mix of very
conservative politics and people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing climate change daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the mayor of South Miami,
because Miami has all these little cities
[SPEAKER_01]: that are sort of part of the larger
metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a movement down there for them to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's five themes that came
out of this workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should mention, there were about 90
people from New York City, environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: educators and related professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came out of the discussions
amongst the experts and with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who participated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first is about emotion,
and that environmental education should
[SPEAKER_01]: really be considering how we help people
cope with emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these emotions can be the sort of
feelings of vulnerability and climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change denial that I discussed earlier
when I mentioned terror management theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can also be these feelings of
sadness and loss, I think, as the minister
[SPEAKER_01]: in the audio talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard when you think about,
are you just telling, say, young people
[SPEAKER_01]: about the science of climate change and
what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to sort of, what do you
do about how they react to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second is environmental justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find this one really interesting,
not only because it's sort of about a
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and that there's already an
environmental justice movement and that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can join forces with them and then maybe
have a larger impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also really interesting because I
think the civil rights movement has
[SPEAKER_01]: something, has possibly some lessons for
us in dealing with climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, you can imagine what
a sort of overwhelming problem civil
[SPEAKER_01]: rights or racial inequities were to people
in the 60s and 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, there was a really well organized
sort of starting at the grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: movements that made incredible changes in
our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may be things we can learn about
how they organized and how they worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, third is collective action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the idea that we need to think
about not just these individual behavior
[SPEAKER_01]: changes that we've thought about in the
past, like, you know, changing our water
[SPEAKER_01]: use at a home level, but also more
collectively how we can make a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maria Tolero really spoke about that
in the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if we're going to do think
about collective action, one things we
[SPEAKER_01]: might do is think about what the research
is largely coming out of sociology that
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about what are the elements that are
usually present before collective action
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is social capital or trust
and connections between people,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as social norms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of sort of starting an
environmental ed program with what is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, climate change and global
warming, you might start a program with
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about, well, how do we create
some social connections and trust amongst
[SPEAKER_01]: the people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we create strong social norms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the theory would predict that
people have more capacity to act
[SPEAKER_01]: collectively to address these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advocacy education, and this one is really
the most controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just controversial for science
educators, it's also really controversial
[SPEAKER_01]: for environmental educators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in part because the field has been
criticized extensively for being advocates
[SPEAKER_01]: and being, you know, left wing,
socialist, communist, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reaction has been to really
retreat from any of this normative stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and just say, well, we're going to teach
the facts and then we're going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people to make their own decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, I think, given the scale,
again, of the problem, I think we should
[SPEAKER_01]: reconsider this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think we can look back at the
civil rights movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about us as a land grant
institution and think about the 50s or
[SPEAKER_01]: 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we would think,
well, our role is to do, and it's too bad
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Peters isn't here because he would
have a lot to say about this, but our role
[SPEAKER_01]: is just to, is to sort of, you know,
transfer what's known about race or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that based on the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look back on it now,
we might say that would have been quite
[SPEAKER_01]: irresponsible or even immoral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a parallel here with climate
change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last is climate change is the
new normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about that earlier, explicitly
acknowledging that the earth has changed
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can't really conserve our natural
heritage, at least in many cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we might have tried to do before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said I'd present three different
projects, but I'm going to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more in depth on this last project in
particular, I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation in relation to climate change
as the new normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So climate change simply means adjustments
in ecological, social or, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: climate adaptation means adjustments in
ecological, social or economic systems in
[SPEAKER_01]: response to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the IPC report that
just came out this year, they have three
[SPEAKER_01]: different major categories of adaptation
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's physical, structural,
social, which has to do with equity
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, and then institutional,
which has to do with changing government
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies or non-profits or international
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within each of those categories,
they have subcategories that I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've just chosen the ones that I think
are most consistent with environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ecosystem based under physical,
structural, community based, and education
[SPEAKER_01]: under social, and engagement under
institutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, this I just picked up last
night, I think it was on a BBC article and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about Boston re-envisioning itself as
Venice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually, yeah, they mentioned
Amsterdam also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so ecosystem based adaptation is the
use of biodiversity and ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_01]: to help communities and people adapt to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can think of, again,
this falls under physical, structural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can think of seawalls or putting all
our utilities on the second floor of
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings where they're on flood zones or
high water zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can also think about sort of
plantings, oyster reefs, oyster
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge effort on oyster
restoration in New York City estuary right
[SPEAKER_01]: now as sort of more consistent with the
environmental values of environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And community based adaptation,
which are locally driven adaptation
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies that operate on learning by
doing bottom up and empowerment paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I like to think of community
gardens as a really good example of a
[SPEAKER_01]: community based adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because I think people
in community gardens, they engage in these
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of discussions, as Megan knows,
and has helped them with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to make a lot of decisions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to decide, okay, how do we
decide who gets a plot?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we decide on whether pesticides are
allowed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody lets their weeds grow,
what kind of sanctions are we going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been some work done by Erica
Svensson in New York City at that Forest
[SPEAKER_01]: Service Urban Research Station,
looking at how what goes on this decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making in these little kind of
interventions and empowerment that people
[SPEAKER_01]: get, how it scales up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are, I like to think of these as
kind of training grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times the people that are in
community gardens are immigrants and they
[SPEAKER_01]: may not have participated in civil society
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes people that have been
in these gardens and been in decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making roles or participated in these
discussions then go on and they become
[SPEAKER_01]: advocates at a larger scale, like for
preserving green space in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's a lot of these
kinds of civic ecology practices or
[SPEAKER_01]: greening practices that we can think of as
combining ecosystem based, community
[SPEAKER_01]: based, and education adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, they provide opportunities
for environmental learning even though
[SPEAKER_01]: there might not be a formal education
program there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can be things like restoring
wetlands and salt marshes to buffer
[SPEAKER_01]: against sea level rise and installing
green infrastructure such as this green
[SPEAKER_01]: roof garden in New York City, as well as
porous pavements and community gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting back to my originally question,
was Superstorm Sandy a tipping point for
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental education?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not, but I do think that there's
a lot of new ideas being generated that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can follow up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are seeing changes in EE and
some of the major changes I think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing are the use of the terms resilience
and people starting to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These environmental stewardship like the
dune restoration practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: More thinking about collective action and
then reconsidering the notion of advocacy
[SPEAKER_01]: given the scale of the issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that I'd like to thank my
colleagues Bryce Dubois, Judy Brouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: Anne Ferguson, and John Fraser who have
helped me think about some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, as well as my funders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I talked about advocacy,
views expressed are not necessarily those
[SPEAKER_01]: of the funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
