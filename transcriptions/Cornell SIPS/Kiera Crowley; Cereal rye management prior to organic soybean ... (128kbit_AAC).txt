[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Kira Crowley, as Matt just
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've spent the last two years working
in Matt's Sustainable Cropping Systems
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my research has focused on cereal rye
as a cover crop and the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: different management strategies on soil
health, weed suppression, soybean yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be presenting to you some
of my results today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to be up here after
these two years and two seasons of field
[SPEAKER_00]: work and finally, at this point,
presenting this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get started, I just want to
thank Dr. Harold Van Ness and Dr. Miguel
[SPEAKER_00]: Gomez for being on my committee as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start just with a brief
introduction to my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to focus on the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of 2016, there were 330,000 acres of
soybean planted in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two and a half times the acreage in
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soybean production is a large and
growing industry in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, as of 2014, New York raked
number three in the country in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: number of organic farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic production is also a large and
growing industry in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as I'm sure many of you are aware
of, there are many challenges with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps the main challenge is with
wheat suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, in organic systems,
the main tool for managing weeds is
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, reliance on tillage can lead to
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, it can destroy soil
structure, which can lead to erosion and
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also quite fuel and labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that presents a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third challenge I'd like to talk about
is not only a challenge to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production, but to all agricultural
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's increased climate variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing in this map is that
between 1958 and 2012, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation falling during heavy
rainfall events increased 71% in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing more intense storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing more drought like we
experienced last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to deal with all of
these challenges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one possible solution is planting
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what our lab focuses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an exciting solution that a lot
of farmers and researchers are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has potential to improve soil health
and weed suppression and perhaps even
[SPEAKER_00]: increase profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my research is really focused on
cereal rye as a cover crop and assessing
[SPEAKER_00]: the extent to which it can address some of
these challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why cereal rye?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cereal rye is a really great cover
crop for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that it's feasible for a late fall
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really important, especially in
the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're harvesting is typically later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really need to get a cover crop
established and going before the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal rye also reduces winter soil
erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a large amount of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is good at suppressing weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also be used as a forage,
which we'll talk a little bit more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three different management
methods of cereal rye that we were really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first involves incorporating the
cereal rye at jointing stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call this the plow down treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had a rylage treatment where the
cereal rye was harvested at boot stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stubble was incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we have a plow down
treatment where the cereal rye was roller
[SPEAKER_00]: crimped and laid on the soil surface to
remain there throughout the season as a
[SPEAKER_00]: weed suppressive mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a short clip of a roller
crimper in a second in case you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these three treatments were compared
to a no cover crop treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were especially interested in the
rylage and roll down treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rylage because of growing interest
from farmers in harvesting their cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops to increase profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roll down because of its ability
to suppress weeds and therefore allow no
[SPEAKER_00]: till during the soybean season in organic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case some of you haven't seen a roll
down treatment, this is a roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the roller crimper rolling down
the cereal rye in my experiment in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, this cylinder is
literally rolling the rye down and
[SPEAKER_00]: crimping it to terminate it so that it
will not come back as a weed and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: stay on the soil surface and as a weed
suppressive mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypothesis was that compared to a
no cover crop control, integrating a
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal rye cover crop prior to organic
soybean would improve soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: weed suppression, soybean yield,
and profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give a brief outline of our
materials and methods, the experiment was
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated in 2014 and repeated in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was set up as a randomized complete
block design with four replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal rye was drilled at 188 kilograms
per hectare in the fall and the soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: was planted at 600 and 18,000 seeds per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data was analyzed with linear mixed
effects models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fixed effects were treatment,
year, and a treatment by year interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the random effects were a block and
block by year interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compared the LS means with
Tukey's HSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data collection included cover crop
biomass, soil sampling, Cornell soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health analyses including soil
respiration, potentially mineralizable
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, wet aggregate stability,
and active carbon, water infiltration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we measured with Cornell sprinkle
infiltrometers, which I'll show you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, soil moisture, soil temperature,
weed biomass, grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I conducted an economic
analysis where I looked at the variable
[SPEAKER_00]: costs, the labor required, and the return
over variable costs for each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Cornell sprinkle
infiltrometer for those of you who haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was designed by Dr. Helvannes and Bob
Schindelbeck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is used to apply a constant
rainfall rate to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the indicator that we calculate
from that is sorptivity, which takes into
[SPEAKER_00]: account both the time to runoff,
TRO, and R, the rainfall rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're able to compare how long it
takes to runoff in each treatment where
[SPEAKER_00]: you do this measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get into the results,
I just wanted to remind you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue line is the 30-year average of
accumulated precipitation between April
[SPEAKER_00]: and October.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line is 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green line is 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, 2015 was an abnormally wet
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2016 was abnormally dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's especially important to note this
flat line here in June and throughout a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of July where we were really getting
no rain at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really did affect our results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at cereal rye biomass,
there was no treatment by year interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did include bars for years within
the treatments just because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you that there was a year effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more cereal rye biomass in 2016
than in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply because the cereal rye
was seeded earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seeded on September 18th in that
second year, whereas it was seeded on
[SPEAKER_00]: October 7th, the year before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did have more cereal rye biomass the
second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's more important to note here is
the treatment differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these letters indicate differences
pooled over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that the roll down had a
higher cereal rye biomass than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply because it was in the
ground growing for longer, like two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was significantly more biomass
there that was rolled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into some of the soil health
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I did several soil health
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were no treatment
differences with wet aggregate stability
[SPEAKER_00]: or active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really have time today to get
into the potentially mineralizable
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to present the soil
respiration results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil respiration is really a measure
of how much CO2 is evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: During a certain time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's measuring microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did see a higher soil respiration
in the roll down treatment compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: no cover treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be explained by the fact that
there was more biomass in that treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cereal rye was growing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots were developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense that there would be
more microbial activity in that treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: than in the no cover, where there was no
cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at sorptivity, just to remind you,
this was an indicator that was calculated
[SPEAKER_00]: by using the Cornell sprinkle
infiltrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're measuring the time to run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing that in the roll down
treatment, the time to run off was longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than in the no cover treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the water is dripping from the
infiltrometer, in the roll down treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that cereal rye is absorbing a lot of that
water and also slowing down the water
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the soil surface, giving it more
time to infiltrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's macro pores that the
cereal rye roots have created growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil that also facilitates
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that there would be a
longer time to run off in the roll down
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment compared to the no cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is soil moisture in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, we started measuring at the
beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the stars here are to
signify that the roll down treatment had a
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that was significantly different than
the other three treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that the roll down
treatment on these four dates had
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly higher soil moisture than
all of the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be explained by the cereal
rye slowing down evaporation and also
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing water infiltration, as we saw
with the sorptivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw this trend again in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I knew what I was doing a little
bit better and started measuring earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started measuring soil moisture May
31st when we planted the soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw higher, again, higher soil
moisture in the roll down treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to all the other treatments on
many of the dates measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been seen in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it makes sense, slowed
evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improved infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at soil temperature, I'm going to
only present soil temperature data from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 because, again, we only started
collecting data in 2015 in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were no differences between
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2016, we did see differences
between treatments when we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly, average, and maximum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, again,
the stars indicating when the roll down
[SPEAKER_00]: had a significantly different mean
compared to the other three treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time a lower mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the roll down on
several of the dates had a lower average
[SPEAKER_00]: and lower maximum weekly temperature
compared to the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply because of the
insulative effects of the cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's blocking that solar radiation and
also reflecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lower soil temperatures have been
seen in other literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could be a bad thing earlier in the
season when soybeans are just germinating
[SPEAKER_00]: and starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could also be a good thing later in
the season when soybeans in tilled
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments have higher soil temperature
and might be experiencing heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this treatment, they're really
protected from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see higher weed biomass in the roll
down treatment compared to the other
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was still relatively low for
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just 400 kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very low for an organic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into the yield data,
I just wanted to show you some pictures to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there aren't really any
noticeable differences between treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: in this year, in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in 2016, there were some
noticeable differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the soybeans in the roll down
treatment were pretty far behind the other
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was reflected in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, all of the three cereal rye
treatments, the plow down, the rye ledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roll down, performed well compared to
the no cover treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in 2016, the yield in the roll
down treatment really dropped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note, though,
that in 2015, when the climate was more
[SPEAKER_00]: normal, when there was more rain,
the roll down treatment did perform very
[SPEAKER_00]: well compared to the no cover treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the drop in yield in the drought year
can really be explained by a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is problems with seed placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a seed that's on top of cereal
rye that's been pushed into the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been seen as a problem in
rolled systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, in a normal year,
it's not a big issue because the seed does
[SPEAKER_00]: get rainwater and is able to imbibe and
send down those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a dry year, we didn't get any rain
after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't able to imbibe and send down
those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this did affect yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, moving on to the economic
analysis, I looked at total costs and
[SPEAKER_00]: total labor by looking at all of the field
operations that occurred in each
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all of the field operations
in 2014 and 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar to the field operations
that occurred in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is this year we had,
I mean, in 2015, there were five inter-row
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation events, whereas in 2016,
with the dry weather, there weren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: many weeds, so not as much need to
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were fewer cultivation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to calculate the total cost,
we took the custom rates for all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also added the cost of the
cereal rye seed and the soybean seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate these total variable costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the no cover treatment
had the lowest costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there was no cereal rye
being drilled in that treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they avoided that expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roll down treatment is also a pretty
low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's showing that the lack of
cultivation, that money saved from not
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating in that treatment,
was almost enough to compensate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the labor,
this is really, really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the low labor in the roll down
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because, again, of the lack of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're saving a lot of labor time
in that treatment by not doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only compared to the no cover is it
lower labor, but also compared to the plow
[SPEAKER_00]: down, which might be a more typical way of
managing cereal rye in organic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is much lower labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the return over variable
costs, the rye-ledge performed very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it had higher costs, as we saw in
the past slide, mainly because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting and baling expenses,
you're getting a lot of added income from
[SPEAKER_00]: that rye-ledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did have higher profitability than
the other two cereal rye treatments in
[SPEAKER_00]: both years and even higher profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the no cover treatment in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the roll down treatment in
2015, we saw that the profitability was
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable to the no cover and the plow
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in 2016, the profitability
dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that was because of the yield
drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, compared to the no cover
treatment, there was greater soil
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration in the roll down treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was greater infiltration and soil
moisture in the roll down treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed biomass was greater in the roll down
treatment, but again, very reasonable for
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic system, really pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield was very low in the roll down
treatment in the drought year in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important to note that it
was also very good in 2015 when we had
[SPEAKER_00]: more rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more of a typical year for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important to learn that it
doesn't do well in drought, but it does do
[SPEAKER_00]: well when there is more moisture,
more rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The costs were lowest in the no cover
treatment, but the labor requirement was
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest in the roll down treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, profitability was greater in
the rye-ledge treatment than other cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: rye treatments in both of the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, in summary, there is no one
cereal rye management method that gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you all of the benefits, the soil health,
the weed suppression, the soybean yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: the profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain ones give you a smattering of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the rye-ledge, you're getting
increased profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the roll down, you're getting some
increases in soil health and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in labor, which is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are, as I said, also having
comparable yields and comparable
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability in that roll down treatment
in a good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the roll down treatment is really
getting pretty close to hitting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But good to note that it doesn't work so
well in a drought year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I would like to thank everybody
that helped me in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really worried I was going to forget
somebody, and I think I did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab,
Tatiana and Alejandro and Shelley,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you all for your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to thank the USDORG
program for funding this research,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab,
all of our present and past members,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the research assistants that helped
with the field work, and finally,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cornell Soil Health Lab for helping me
with all those analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Paul Stachowski out at Musgrave
Research Prime and all of his team for
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with the field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have another presentation,
so I think we'll limit the questions to
[SPEAKER_01]: just one or two quick ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering about the weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that for one particular year or an
average over the two years?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an average over the two years,
because there was no treatment by year
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did the two years differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more weed biomass in the first
year, because there was more moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, David?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you can do if you
planted the soybeans and two weeks later,
[SPEAKER_02]: you still haven't had any rain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way to then incorporate that,
or drill that, or recover from that
[SPEAKER_02]: situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, practically, what a farmer might
do, they've already invested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They print, they plant, they say,
now no rain came.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get that seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any mechanical way to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about a mechanical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that irrigation could work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried irrigating, but we didn't have
the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't really set up to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were only able to add a quarter inch
of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were really set up for that,
then that would help, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about a mechanical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should we?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking, because of the soil
moisture, it would fire in the crimp down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in fact, if you could get the seed
established, it would do very well in the
[SPEAKER_03]: draft.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
