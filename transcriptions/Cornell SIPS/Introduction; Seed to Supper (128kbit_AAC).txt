[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of program would best benefit
those people who want to garden versus
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going into the community and
trying to persuade people to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that takes a different approach
and it goes beyond food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes beyond food.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a facilitator, the community's needs
always come first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to watch that because we are
also in an educational system where there
[SPEAKER_00]: are sort of experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the people who are not experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as experts, we come in thinking,
oh, well, this is what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what has failed for so many
years, coming in with that mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming in with letting the community
decide what they want in the day is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partnerships are very, very community
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you're working with a
senior living center, it's not about
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the food they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the type of spices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds them of home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds them of a time of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of seniors, aging can bring
about issues of isolation, loneliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that can remind them of home
is something that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen in downtown Ithaca and
some of the senior living centers is that
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the gardens are herb based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an example of being community
specific and understanding community
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going into a population
that has knowledge of the old days and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to remember the old days and
honor the old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the partnership is also about being
community specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encourages community involvement and
participation at all levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it also empowers communities to
commit to long term change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because the bean plant
grows perfectly around the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't suffocate the corn at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, they grow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about senior separate
facilitation, it's a partnership,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not defined based on what we
think a partnership is to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times we think it's a
50-50 thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When working with communities,
it's never 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 80-20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 20-40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it might not even be 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to rid ourselves of the idea
of what we think a partnership is and
[SPEAKER_00]: rethink the idea of a partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what seed to supper is all
about when it comes to community
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
Thank you.
