[SPEAKER_08]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's a great honor to be here today
and thank you for joining me and I hope
[SPEAKER_05]: you enjoy my talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so today we talk about suppression of
the host immune system and how ink-set and
[SPEAKER_05]: microbe infectors take control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I would like to give you a brief
introduction about the plant immune system
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can see here different pathogens
and they're trying to attack the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: cells and possibly to gather nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other part, we have a plant cells
that during the co-evolution develop
[SPEAKER_05]: strategy to first recognize these
pathogens and then to effectively give a
[SPEAKER_05]: defense responses and these rely on the
plant immune system and we can divide this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant immune system to major layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is called a PTI, Palm Triggered Immune
immunity and it relies on a surface
[SPEAKER_05]: receptor kinase called PRR, pattern
recognition receptor.
[SPEAKER_05]: This receptor can perceive concerned
molecule from pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are called PAMPs,
pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when these receptor like FLS2
recognize the gelling, will first
[SPEAKER_05]: associate with a coreceptor, for example,
BAC1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And which is required for the signaling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these will follow calcium elevation
followed by a ROS production.
[SPEAKER_05]: ROS are reactive oxygen species like
hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_05]: peroxide oxidates all the membrane and can
sell that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pathogen cannot spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for many of the pathogen, this is the
end of their journey, but also bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: co-evolve with the plants and they develop
different strategies like effector
[SPEAKER_05]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: These molecules are translocated directly
inside the cell and they can manipulate,
[SPEAKER_05]: interfere with the PTI.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have any more the ROS
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we have the second layer of a
plant immune system called ETI.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have another class of receptor also
known as a resistance receptor.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a new entry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a recent concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of effector secreted effectors to modulate
the plant host.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are these effectors?
[SPEAKER_05]: So effectors are molecule produced by
pathogen that modify host molecular
[SPEAKER_05]: behavior to enable parasitism.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have different kinds of effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, apoplastic effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are secreted to the host
extracellular space and they can target
[SPEAKER_05]: host proteases.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have also cytoplasmic effectors and
these effectors are translocated inside
[SPEAKER_05]: the cell and can suppress or otherwise
manipulate host processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now characterization of molecular
functions or effectors provide key
[SPEAKER_05]: information for understanding processes
underlying plant colonization by pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I'm doing with my
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to functionally characterize
effector from different pathosystems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's go back and this is a little bit
of my background.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I obtained my bachelor and master
degree in plant biology in Turin and in
[SPEAKER_05]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that I did my study in England,
Norwich.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here I tried to expand my research
topic and I was studying plant-insect
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more recently I moved here in the US
at USDA-RS and my study was we're focusing
[SPEAKER_05]: on plant-insect microbe interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now at UF I'm also trying to develop
tools in order to solve agricultural
[SPEAKER_05]: problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also interested in interaction
between fungus and insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after my study in Turin I went to
Norwich and here they have a really nice
[SPEAKER_05]: research park.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for example this is a genomic analysis
center.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Sainsbury laboratory and the
Johninus Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was able to establish a
collaboration between the University of
[SPEAKER_05]: Turin and the Johninus Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here I was we were trying to
functionally characterize effector protein
[SPEAKER_05]: from UF in myelospersice and epizome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is an EM picture from an epizome
and you can see it is a peculiar mouth
[SPEAKER_05]: part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for a plant pathogen to be successful
manipulation of host cell processes to
[SPEAKER_05]: promote virulence is essential,
which is achieved by the secretion
[SPEAKER_05]: molecule thermal effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do that we use this novel approach
based on a combination of bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_05]: and functional assay to identify effectors
from myelospersice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is how we identify these effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we start with EST's cellular gland from
myelospersice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we look for a protein containing a
signal peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Signal peptide tells to the cell to
translocate outside the protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we remove all the protein with
the transmembrane domain.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want a protein that can move.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we finish to identify fortices
candidate effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the functional analysis
we need to characterize these effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we overspread this candidate in
Nicotiana mentamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we cut leaf disc and use it as
acrylic plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we add four nymphs each leaf
disc.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we count the number of nymphs
produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one effector MpCO2 increased the
number of the nymphs when they were
[SPEAKER_05]: feeding on this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may indicate that this protein is
important on the plant-insect interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have two Mp10 and Mp42 that
actually decrease the numbers of nymphs
[SPEAKER_05]: produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also found that Mp10 is actually
inducing chlorosine in a weak cell death.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also it can suppress PTI induced by
pamphlagellin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is quite a contradictory
observation, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hypothesis is that overspreading
Mp10 is actually triggering some plant
[SPEAKER_05]: defense responses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps in a normal effort plant
interaction, other effectors are
[SPEAKER_05]: suppressing this response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mp10 can contribute to the variance by
suppressing the PTI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there is another way to functionally
characterize gene function.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's using RNA silencing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can knock down the gene expression
of affected genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how this RNA interference works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we know a sequence of RNA messenger,
we can synthesize double-cell RNA and then
[SPEAKER_05]: deliver it to the cells, which will
recognize double-cell RNA using Dicer
[SPEAKER_05]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will chop the double-cell RNA in small
interference RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it will complex with risk,
which will identify the corresponding
[SPEAKER_05]: messenger RNA and block the transcription.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, at that time, there were two systems
for double-cell RNA delivery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the injection or artificial diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But both systems have some drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you need an injector.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to make glass needles.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to produce double-cell RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for the artificial diet,
you need to optimize the diet for the
[SPEAKER_05]: effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to replace the diet because of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And both are in artificial condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I decide to use a different system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I use this vector that allows the
expression of double-cell RNA in plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I generate transgenic Arabidopsis,
expressing double-cell RNA to target
[SPEAKER_05]: affected genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also use a transient expression
using Nicotiana mentamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to show you the results using
the transient expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we select two genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, MPCO from salivaglans.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the gene that increase the nymphs
when they feed on of expression plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a GAT protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see if the signal was able to
move from the GAT and the salivaglans.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the results using the leaf
disc I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are after 17 days of aphid
feeding on this plant, expressing
[SPEAKER_05]: double-cell RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see we can suppress the gene
expression of both genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are almost 50%, which is similar
to the amount of silencing you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: with the injection and with the feeding on
artificial diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are aphids feeding on the
double-cell RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the fecundity results.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found that silencing MPCO to reduce the
number of nymphs produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you over express this gene,
increase the number of the nymphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you silence this gene, you decrease the
number of the nymphs produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this rack is the GAT protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we think that it may be important for
uptake in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by silencing them, we have a less
natural uptake, and that will decrease the
[SPEAKER_05]: fecundity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are northern bloc using the leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are expressing double-cell RNA in
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can detect small interferon RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the leaf tissue from a plant
expressing double-cell RNA for MPCO2 and
[SPEAKER_05]: this for rack.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I told you before, the plant
recognized double-cell RNA and chopped in
[SPEAKER_05]: small interferon RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the aphid is actually uptaking small
interference RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a quite system that I
developed to have an easy way to deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: double-cell RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't expect that then later,
this system was actually used not only in
[SPEAKER_05]: aphid, but in other insect species.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, it can be used as a tool for
insect management.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we were also interested to see if
these aphid effectors have adapted to
[SPEAKER_05]: modulate processes in a specific plant
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a generalist aphid,
like mysospersaceae, and we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: specialist aphid, like epizome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can fit only on legumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we generate a transgenic plant
expressing mysospersaceae effectors,
[SPEAKER_05]: and a transgenic plant expressing epizome
orthologs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did the fecundity assay on our
aphidopsis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we add the adults on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we wait for new names so we can
synchronize the age of the names.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we cage them again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we wait for 16 days, and we count
the number of the names produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mysospersaceae, effectors promote
fecundity in mysospersaceae only when they
[SPEAKER_05]: are feeding on a plant expressing
mysospersaceae effectors, not when they
[SPEAKER_05]: are feeding on epizome orthologs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we reveal that there is a high
non-synonymous versus synonymous
[SPEAKER_05]: nucleotide substitution rates with
effector orthologs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So indicating that the effectors in
mysospersaceae are fast evolving as a
[SPEAKER_05]: consequence of evolutionary pressure,
which drives rapid diversification on
[SPEAKER_05]: effector function to improve function when
they are secreted in the cell or for
[SPEAKER_05]: escaping the recognition by plant immune
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the last work we did with
aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the beginning, I show you that one
of the earliest physiological response to
[SPEAKER_05]: plant is a calcium elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found that aphid feed inside
triggered this calcium elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a transgenic plant expressing a
biomarker that binds calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the feeding site of aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we didn't see calcium elevation when
we used a transgenic plant expressing this
[SPEAKER_05]: biomarker in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So only when the aphid was probing in the
mesofil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found that this calcium elevation
is back one dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back one is the core receptor required for
signaling.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a back one mutant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any more of the calcium
elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, there is a bacterial ion
channel, TPC1, that contributes to the
[SPEAKER_05]: calcium elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a mutant for the TPC1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a lower calcium concentration.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we use a TPC1 overreaction with a
burst of calcium that can actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: we use a fecundity assay on this plant and
reduce the aphid performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So aphid trigger calcium elevation during
probing of epidermal and mesofil cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And saliva, which contain effectors,
is secreted into the cell types,
[SPEAKER_05]: different cell types.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can actually suppress the feeding
site of calcium elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most cells along the stylet pathway
are punctured intracellularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that the cell are punctured by
using the electrical penetration graft.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see here there's a aphid wire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now this is a part of the circuit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the aphids start probing with the
stylet, we generate a signal, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: converted in waveforms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this waveform corresponds to a
particular feeding behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, PD is a potential drug drop
when the stylet puncture the cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: E1 and E2 is when the stylet reach the
phloem and start feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see the aphid puncture many
epidermal and mesofil cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the model now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aphid, similar to plant pathogens,
inject protein into host plants to
[SPEAKER_05]: manipulate host cell process enabling
successful manifestation of plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is a cell with the stylet and the
saliva-contained effectors that can
[SPEAKER_05]: modulate the PTI response.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So concluding remarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our work provides important evidence
that herbivores insect, similar to plant
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogenic microbes, secrete effector
inside host cells that interact with host
[SPEAKER_05]: protein and modify their activity to
facilitate infestation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was my work during my PhD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, I moved to here in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: And first with USDA and now at UF,
I'm trying to conduct research to develop
[SPEAKER_05]: and transfer solution to solve agriculture
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how do we transfer basic principles
to disease management programs?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we control vector using
sustainable system?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we reduce the economic impact
caused by plant disease?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we minimize the input and maximize
the output?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I want to show you a screening I
developed to identify citrus less
[SPEAKER_05]: susceptible to cancer disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a cancer disease and is caused by
these bacteria, Santa Mona citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the symptoms on leaves and
on fruits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we know that during the PTI,
plant cells using the PRR receptor like
[SPEAKER_05]: FLS-2 can recognize flagellin and start
the PTI.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can also use a peptide called
FLS-22.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't need to use the living
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will trigger the same PTI
response with the rose production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of that, I designed this
screening and I show you how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take leaf disc from citrus plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we use this 96 plates.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put the leaf disc on this 96 plates
plus the flagellin.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the list of the trigger hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can convert this hydrogen peroxide
in a signal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the end results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see it's a really quick
response.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a few minutes, we can measure the
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have a peak and then it goes
to a basic level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting is that we have a
different level of rose production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found that citrus, more susceptible
to citrus cancer, produce low amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why plant less susceptible to citrus
cancer produce high concentration of rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I screen hundreds of citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Caterantus rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sour orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I separate plant with high rose
production and plant with low rose
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I infect this plant with living
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the high rose production corresponded
to lower cancer lesion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with low rose production correspond to
high cancer lesion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with this system, live pathogen is
substituted with the flagellin peptide,
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly when the pathogen is
regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a rapid method for identify
citrus seedling, less susceptible to Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Mona citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't need to propagate plants for
pathogenicity test.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now this system is implemented in
citrus hybrid selection, USDA for Pierce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this system allows us to identify
plants that are less susceptible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have some citrus that are normally
very susceptible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't produce high rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how can we improve the tolerance,
the resistance of these plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this case, we use a transgenic
stools.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took the FLS2 PRR receptor from
Nicotera mentamiana and we generate
[SPEAKER_05]: transgenics with orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: With orange, usually produce low rose
using the flagellin-22.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So transgenic plant expressing Nicotera
mentamiana FLS2 has a high rose compared
[SPEAKER_05]: to the control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these, again, after infection with
living bacteria, cause less lesion on the
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of expression of Nicotera FLS2 in
transgenic citrus increase cancer
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I will switch to another citrus
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is called citrus anglum bean,
HLB, or citrus greening disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the most destructive
diseases of citrus worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's already jeopardizing all the
Florida citrus industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem is spread really quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have this nice growth,
in Florida, without proper management,
[SPEAKER_05]: in less than five years, you can end up
like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow skeletons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now in Florida, we have more
than 130,000 acres of growth abandoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this disease is caused by Candidatus
liberobacteriaticus, and is spread by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Deferina citrus, which can feed all citrus
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are typical symptoms of HLB.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have an uneven distribution of yellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to give you some numbers,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, I don't know if the zoom is
interfering.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So SILAS was initially detected in Florida
in 2005.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, the production of boxes
dropped from 300 million to 68 millions.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, the cost of the extract
acres increased from $700 to more than
[SPEAKER_05]: $2,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most important, there is no cure for
HLB disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are many groups that are trying
to figure out how to fight back these
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way we are trying to fight these
bacteria has some nice novelty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are trying, with this
multi-institutional collaboration,
[SPEAKER_05]: to develop a synthetic bacteria with this
particular feature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want a culture of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: SILAS right now is not cultured,
and it is slow down the research on this
[SPEAKER_05]: pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted to create also a secretion
system to deploy bacteriocines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can use this bacteria, which is
cultured, which has a system to secrete
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteriocines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can use as a cross-protection
against SILAS.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, this system not only can work on
SILAS, it can potentially be used for
[SPEAKER_05]: studying other pathosystems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have a different team task.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for example, SGI, funded by Craig
Renter, and in 2010, for the first time,
[SPEAKER_05]: was able to generate a synthetic bacteria
from scratch in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are taking care of the synthetic
genome generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here in Cornell, Michelle is working
on the vector acquisition and
[SPEAKER_05]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at USDA in Fort Pierce, they are
working and looking for bacteriocines that
[SPEAKER_05]: can be used against SILAS.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are my tasks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to identify a vector gene
that are helping the synthetic bacteria to
[SPEAKER_05]: help the infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, I'm looking for genes that can
induce pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to include genes that allow
infestation, but we want to remove genes
[SPEAKER_05]: that can cause pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also looking for a mechanical
inoculation system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will give us a quick way to study
the bacteria without using the vector
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the name of the synthetic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we call it Liberabacter Difensorium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, we can use it to fight
SILAS.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first task, effective identification.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how SILAS manipulates its host.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to do that, so SILAS is a
floam-limited bacterium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes advantage of its vector,
cilids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar to aphid, it uses the stylet to
probe the plant cells and eventually then
[SPEAKER_05]: find the c elements.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, an infected cilid will secrete also
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these bacteria will secrete effector
proteins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, these effector proteins can move in
the floam and possibly target different
[SPEAKER_05]: organelles and modulate function.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the pipeline we use to identify
SILAS effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is similar to the one we use for
effector in aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we start with the ASEAD SILAS coding
genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we apply different filters,
like presence of signal peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we remove protein with the
transmembrane domain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we end up with 28 putative secreted
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we clone without the signal
peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also express only in the natural
protein, in Nicotiana mentamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also look for localization of these
effector in plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look also for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of these proteins, last 5315,
it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, two days later,
the expression we had cell death.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will talk about this in the next few
slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, this protein was targeting
chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can see the signal surrounding the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, this protein was inducing callus
deposition in the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of the symptoms we have in
HLB disease plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a high callus deposition.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the position in the vascular
tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see there is a signal peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have a chloroplast targeting
sequence, and then the rest of the
[SPEAKER_05]: protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last 5315 is a protein without the
signal peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I generate another construct
without the signal peptide in a
[SPEAKER_05]: chloroplast targeting sequence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while the 5315 was causing cell death,
the one without the chloroplast targeting
[SPEAKER_05]: sequence was causing chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found that the chlorosis was caused
by starch accumulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this protein triggered a massive starch
accumulation in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see during the day,
we have accumulation of the starch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then more interestingly, we see that
during the night, there is no degradation
[SPEAKER_05]: of the starch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also look from some gene expression
of gene related to the starch synthesis
[SPEAKER_05]: and the starch degradation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this gene related to the starch
degradation are downregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And HLB symptoms are caused by massive
starch accumulation until chloroplast
[SPEAKER_05]: structures are disrupted with the
resulting chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this protein seems to be very important
in the HLB pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is also some follow up of this
protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we discovered these effectors
candidate, other groups are working on
[SPEAKER_05]: these effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they found, first, that this protein
is highly secreted in plant infected and
[SPEAKER_05]: can be used as a detection marker,
as this protein is moving away from the
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can detect this infection even if
the bacteria is not present in the leaf by
[SPEAKER_05]: another part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, they found that these proteins
play a key role in the HLB pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I was talking about cell death caused
by these effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found three effectors caused by
cell death.
[SPEAKER_05]: And effector trigger immunity relies on a
resistant protein that recognizes
[SPEAKER_05]: effectors in a specific manner,
inducing programmed cell death to prevent
[SPEAKER_05]: the pathogen from spreading.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the components for this
response are the resistant protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea is that nicotinamintamiana,
as a resistant protein, they can recognize
[SPEAKER_05]: these effectors while C2 doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are now in collaboration with
Michel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to try to see if we can identify
these R genes from nicotinamintamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we always press these effectors in
nicotinamintamiana fused to a flag pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can bind with the magnetic
beads this tag, and possibly R gene
[SPEAKER_05]: interacting with the protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we remove, washing all the other
host protein, and then we can sequence the
[SPEAKER_05]: R gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we have an R gene from
nicotinamintamiana that recognize this
[SPEAKER_05]: effector, we can eventually generate
heterogenic citrus expressing
[SPEAKER_05]: nicotinamintamiana R gene that can allow
the citrus plant to recognize it and be
[SPEAKER_05]: immune to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, for this pathosystem, the best
management for this disease is the
[SPEAKER_05]: prevention of the introduction and
establishment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's important to have a system for
early detection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can remove the infected plant and
avoid spreading in your groves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are really fascinating way to
detect SILAS infected citrus tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a USDA arrest, King Gotwell and his
group, they are using dogs to recognize
[SPEAKER_05]: SILAS infected tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this dog can detect the infection two
weeks after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually with QPCR, it takes two to 12
months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because the QPCR is not reliable,
but because the sampling of the tree is
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think the SILAS can feed on the top
of the tree, and then you take leaves,
[SPEAKER_05]: random leaves, you can have a negative
tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are a really nice way to detect
SILAS in the groves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, these dogs recognize plant early
volatiles triggered by SILAS bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we know the SILAS bacteria secrete
effector molecules after infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can detect this effector gene after
six hours after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this effector, we know that they can
travel to the vascular system and modulate
[SPEAKER_05]: host activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my idea was, are these dogs detecting
volatiles triggered by effector molecules?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I designed this experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have four buckets, contain 16 nicotiana
mentamiana plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wild type, net control, and 16 SILAS
effector.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the effector that are early
expressed during infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the dogs, when they identify a SILAS
infected citrus, they sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They never work with the nicotiana
mentamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm the only one that knows that these
buckets contain the SILAS effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we run the dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use eight dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are dogs, first bucket,
second bucket, and this is the bucket with
[SPEAKER_05]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really amazing when he was
recognizing and sits there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're recognizing this plant,
and they think it is infected.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are recognizing the same volatiles
we have in citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the same volatiles is triggered by one
effector in nicotiana mentamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are another dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all dogs recognize these buckets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are a bucket with 16 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the dog very quickly recognized these
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also line up these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every plant was expressing one
effector.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end, they recognize four
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so these dogs are recognizing SILAS
infected citrus at the early stage with an
[SPEAKER_05]: effector's marker.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are indirect recognition.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use a volatiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our idea is now to develop an antibody
protein detection kit against these
[SPEAKER_05]: effector molecules that are early
expressed and that are detected by the
[SPEAKER_05]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully, this kit we can be using in
the groves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can detect early the SILAS in
citrus leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the second task was a mechanical
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is no mechanical inoculation for
SILAS so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we developed a new way to inoculate
SILAS in plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, SILAS is not cultured yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use a SILAS-infected drug for the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we use this system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 3D printer device that can be
attached to the plant and communicated
[SPEAKER_05]: with the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I extract the gut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I extract the bacteria from the gut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I add the bacteria in the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I wait 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I use QPCR to detect bacteria in
the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 24 hours, I was able to detect SILAS
in all the tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two months later, also, I could detect
SILAS bacteria into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a systemic infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to show you how it works, I am now
using a fluorescent probe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I'm using this fluorescent
probe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I add this molecule in the device.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wait 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I slice the stem and the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I look under a fluorescent
microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to see that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the different sections.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the fluorescent probe is
evenly distributed in the vascular tissue,
[SPEAKER_05]: both the stem, but also in the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this system can deliver bacteria,
but can also deliver molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why did we stop there?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can use to screen molecule against
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can also screen molecule against
insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can also use this device to deliver
double serone to regulate host genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we can deliver double serone for plant
feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this system will deliver the
molecule where the insect is feeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was the second task.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my last project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this project, I'm studying the
interaction between fungus and insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do that, I'm using the
entopathogenic angi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to use this system to manage
citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They transmit the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, the main control for
the HRB is to control the vector.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to reduce the number of the
vector.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do that, they use a chemical
insecticide.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is not a sustainable strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, we have environmental pollution.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a reduction of three trophic
interactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And insect can become resistant to
insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we may have pesticide residue in food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, we need constant
application to maintain the effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are trying now these fungus,
Isaria fumorosaea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are results after six days post
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way we do is spraying the spore to
the psyllids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we look the percent of mortality
over six days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see after six days,
we have already almost 100% of mortality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But already after three days, you can see
disease symptoms on our psyllids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in four days, we have the fungus
breaking through the esoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_05]: And six days later, the fungus is ready to
spread again, in effect horizontally or
[SPEAKER_05]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these entomatopoietogenic fungi are
well known.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mechanism underlying the molecular
pathogenesis of entomatopoietogenic fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: are rather limited understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially the vector machinery has not
been established in the interaction
[SPEAKER_05]: between fungus and insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here again, we are trying to identify
potential effector candidates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we start with the coding protein
counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we apply our filters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we end up with 170 candidate
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are also combining these effectors
with RNA sequences, analysis, and gene
[SPEAKER_05]: expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found that many genes, many
candidate effectors, are highly expressed
[SPEAKER_05]: during the first hours, also after 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the very beginning of this
project.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also want to later do some protein
functional analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can try to express these protein
plants or use an artificial diet and check
[SPEAKER_05]: insect fecundity and performance to see
what molecule can interfere with the
[SPEAKER_05]: insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was my last slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So final remarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most pathogens are defeated following
detection of conserved pathogen molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And pathogens deliver molecules called
effector inside their host to enable
[SPEAKER_05]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And effector molecules are a key component
for all pathosystems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And effector molecules can be used as a
guide to improve resistant implants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would like to thank these people
that really helped me to build my strength
[SPEAKER_05]: in my career and helped me to build my
research program.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: The microphone isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious in terms of the work and
research you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the results of this work is going to be
more applicable in terms of detecting the
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogen in the citrus tree, or is it
going to be more used in terms of actual
[SPEAKER_04]: control procedures?
[SPEAKER_04]: The effectors program?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, both.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to use effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, we want to identify the effector
function.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know yet the function of these
effectors or the target.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we know the target, we may know
the function.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the importance of this molecule in
the interaction in this pathosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can use these as a tool to
improve the citrus resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we can, for example, we can use,
if we can, resistant genes to improve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other way is to find the target of
these effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they are susceptible molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we really identify the function,
we may find a way to improve the
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a dog question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dogs are detecting the volatile
made by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be working on making
antibodies to the effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you also working on collecting
headspace and seeing, identifying what
[SPEAKER_00]: these volatiles could be?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something that we will do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something really recent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea is actually to see what
volatiles are expressed, triggering
[SPEAKER_05]: nicotinamine tamiana with effector,
non-effector, and also in citrus infected,
[SPEAKER_05]: non-infected, and see if there is an
overlapping.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will also look for volatiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really intrigued by the 3D printed
device that you attached.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was curious if you know if the CLAS
is actually alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we think it's alive because two months
later, I can detect gene expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are looking at DNA and RNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look at the expression of the
effectors, 28 effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are upregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like the bacteria is alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question actually follows straight on
from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a question about your CLAS effectors
expressed in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you then infect the plant with CLAS,
is the population size of the CLAS
[SPEAKER_06]: increased or decreased?
[SPEAKER_06]: And does it affect the transmissibility
back to the insect?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's asking about the effector proteins
not from the perspective of their
[SPEAKER_06]: immediate function, but in terms of the
effect on the CLAS and whether the CLAS
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits from the secretion of those
proteins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you repeat, please, the question
first?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have plants that are expressing
CLAS effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you done the experiments to then
infect those plants with CLAS and see if
[SPEAKER_06]: they have a selectable benefit?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were using nicotinamine tamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's difficult to infect the
nicotinamine tamiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, we are generating
transgenic citrus expressing this
[SPEAKER_05]: effector.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that case, we can try to inoculate
CLAS in this transgenic plant and see if
[SPEAKER_05]: it increases or decreases the growth of
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Brian over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question follows on from the dog
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make either a diagnostic or some
kind of treatment that's targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially at one of the effectors,
why don't you expect the CLAS to just drop
[SPEAKER_01]: that effector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any reason to think that it's
essential for infection?
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolutionarily, why doesn't the CLAS just
dump that effector so that your diagnostic
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer works, that your intervention no
longer works?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should it dump the effector?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the effector is what you're using to
recognize plants that then need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called, say, that's a strong selective
pressure against the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would be a strong selective
advantage for a pathogen that dropped that
[SPEAKER_01]: effector so that you could no longer
detect the infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are using a cocktail of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it needs to drop many effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case, I don't know if you can
maybe not survive anymore if you keep
[SPEAKER_05]: dropping all the effectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially the question is,
how much do you know about the
[SPEAKER_01]: essentialness for infection of these
effectors?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The function.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know the function.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that some of the effectors are
early expressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six hours later, we can detect these
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 hours later, we have different waves of
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: A week later, we have different waves of
effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we still don't know the function of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hypothesize that the early effector
are important for modified, modulated,
[SPEAKER_05]: and defense responses.
[SPEAKER_05]: The later effector are probably important
for spreading the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the psyllid is delivering C-LAS into
the phloem, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that your device is
introducing C-LAS into the xylem?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it's actually possible because we
see on the top of the plant, on the bottom
[SPEAKER_05]: of the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only way to go up is actually the
xylem taking the bacteria and moving up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And possibly the bacteria can move from
the xylem to the phloem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a day later, we can see the
bacteria in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are studies that show that these
bacteria sometimes you can find in the
[SPEAKER_05]: xylem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they remove the phloem, and the
bacteria can still move from one part of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant to another part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is getting into the phloem with
your device.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe xylem also, but you're sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it starts with the xylem,
and then it moves back to the phloem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't know yet because we don't
have a picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make a picture and section.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see where it actually is present in
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there any evidence that some of
these effectors, these plant effectors,
[SPEAKER_07]: are also expressed in the insect and then
injected through the saliva and not really
[SPEAKER_07]: made by the bacteria inside the plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that first wave that you get six hours,
I assume that you're delivering by insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a graft in inoculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a graft in inoculation of ACP
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because there is, or I guess it's
controversial, is C.
[SPEAKER_07]: lass actually replicating inside the
insect?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea is also that the insect,
while it's puncturing the cell,
[SPEAKER_05]: is actually injecting potentially effector
from the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is already, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the effectors are produced by
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please join me in thanking Marco once
again for an excellent presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
