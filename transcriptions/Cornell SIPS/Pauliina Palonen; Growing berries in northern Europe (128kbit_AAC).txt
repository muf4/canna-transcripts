[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to say a few words
about my home university, University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Helsinki, Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been established in 1640,
so it's quite old.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 25,000 students,
so it's a little bit bigger than Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University, and about 8,000 staff members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the main building of the
university, right downtown in Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole university is divided in
four different campus areas in different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of Helsinki area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work on Viikki campus, which looks
more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a research farm, and we are
situated about six miles from downtown
[SPEAKER_00]: Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a research farm with almost 100
dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the pictures below, you see my
research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also offer international master's
degree programs in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should mention here that university
education is free in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Finnish students don't pay any
tuition fee, but the international
[SPEAKER_00]: students coming from outside European
Union would have to pay tuition fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really nice and green place in
Helsinki to work at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Finland is the most northern
agricultural country in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are situated as far north as Alaska,
between 60 and 70 degrees of northern
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helsinki is here exactly as north as
Anchorage in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this 800-mile-long borderline
with Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side, we have Sweden and
Norway as neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are five and a half million
people living on an area that is about two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half times as large as New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really scarcely populated country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the map of the southern
part of Finland, you see that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of water, a lot of lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are anything between 200,000 of half
a million lakes, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate, which is the minimum size
regarded to be a lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as there are so many lakes,
almost every family has a cabin by the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are our girls sitting on the front
porch of our sauna at our cabin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is directly by the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can jump from the sauna to the
lake, swimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wintertime, this lake is frozen,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have an ice saw, and we cut a
hole in the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go swimming through that hole
in the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the major field crops that are grown in
Finland are barley, wheat, oat,
[SPEAKER_00]: rye, grape seed oil, sugar peat,
potato, and caraway, which is produced for
[SPEAKER_00]: export, almost only for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these crops are grown mainly in the
southern part of Finland, because up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the north, the growing season is too short
for growing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, a lot of dairy farms are
situated around this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for horticultural purposes,
the country is divided into eight
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, apples can only be grown
here, in zone one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the berry production is
concentrated in this area, which is much
[SPEAKER_00]: colder than these coastal areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have a very thick and
permanent snow cover during wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that protects the overwintering berry
plants from winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our light conditions are also really
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in northern Finland, at 70 degrees
northern latitude, in midsummer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun doesn't set at all for a certain
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in wintertime, there is six weeks
period that the sun doesn't rise at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Helsinki, the chain seas in photo
period are less dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, during summertime, it doesn't
get really dark at all at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wintertime, the sun is always very low
in horizon, so it's kind of dusk all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, also during daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many greenhouse crops such as
cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated year round, and many herbs as
well, in greenhouses using artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more and more, the growers are
starting to use LED lighting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is an example of lettuce that is
grown in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those lettuce plants are harvested
with their small pots, with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also sold like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they keep very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place that pot in a glass of water
at home, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about berry production in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was recently a survey among berry
growers, and they tell us that the average
[SPEAKER_00]: berry grow in Finland is 48 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most of them are planning to
continue farming berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them are planning to buy more
tunnels for growing their strawberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major concerns were the high cost
for the places where you can set your cell
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell about this a little bit more
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fake origin of berries, because what
happens every spring, early in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the price for the berries,
for strawberries, especially is very high,
[SPEAKER_00]: always somebody imports berries from
Central Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And puts them into these boxes,
which say Finnish berries, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them as Finnish berries for a good
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may spoil the image of Finnish
berries, because the quality might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the labor is also a big concern,
because now all the people working on
[SPEAKER_00]: berry farms come from either Russia,
White Russia, Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of work for the growers
during the wintertime to organize visas
[SPEAKER_00]: and working permits for all these people
traveling to Finland for the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the farmers have to make sure
these people have a place to live,
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodate themselves, and a place to
cook, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Finnish people are too spoiled to work
on berry farms anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strawberry is the most widely grown
berry crop, followed by black currant,
[SPEAKER_00]: red currant, white currant, and raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a little bit of sea
buckthorn, blueberry, and some aronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would like to share with you some
management practices of each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, and also very briefly to tell about
the research we have done with each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only June-bearing strawberry cultivars are
grown in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polka is the most popular one,
because it has very good-tasting berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberries are usually grown on
raised beds, which are covered with black
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are drip-irrigated, and acryl cover
is used to protect them from winter
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry planting stock comes mainly
from Netherlands, Holland, either as tray
[SPEAKER_00]: plants like this one, which has a small
pot of soil with it, or as bare root
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which are graded according to
their size, the biggest one being waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: bed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are different size
categories based on the diameter of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells how much yield this plant
would produce after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants are stored frozen in
frigo storage, and then they are shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: to the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they are planted, they would
produce a yield 60 days after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they are also called 60-day
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that way, the grower can predict what
time he wants to have yield and adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: planting time accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantalogica is a Dutch company that
provides a very nice service to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who grow strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send your plants to this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will dissect them and count the
flower initials inside the strawberry
crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will get this kind of flower
mapping report, which tells you how many
[SPEAKER_00]: flower trusses were there inside of the
strawberry crown, at which developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stage they were, and how much yield you
can expect back from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant, the one who sells the plants
can use this as a kind of warranty that he
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell how much the plants will produce
yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a sample from your production
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of machine that can be used
before planting the strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would form the raised beds on the
field, cover the bed with a black plastic,
[SPEAKER_00]: make the holes, and then two guys could be
sitting here and putting the plants inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it all can be done in one round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you see the newly planted
strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while, it would look like this
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another picture of the strawberry
farm by the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a Finnish strawberry grower,
or berry grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They studied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he has this really nice big berry
farm in southern Finland by the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he relies on pick your own in
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, he also has a cafeteria on
the farm and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: attractions that people would come there,
spend time, pick berries, buy something at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the popularity of the pick your own has
gone down recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, there are some farms,
pick your own farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in addition to the berries to
sell, you must have a cafeteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice transportation to the field,
farm shop with several different nice
[SPEAKER_00]: products, some pets, animals for kids to
look at, and some other attractions for
[SPEAKER_00]: the kids and the whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will not go there only for the
berries, but also for entertaining and
[SPEAKER_00]: being close to the nature and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berries in supermarket would be sold
in these kind of small clam shells,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like here, but in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of berries also get sold in
these kind of big boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are five kilogram containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, many grocery stores,
they don't want to take berries for sale
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore because they are very perishable
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to keep them good
looking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to everyday check and throw the
bad berries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has happened recently,
they just rent out the place for the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to set up the booth and to sell his
berries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this booth would usually be outside a
huge grocery store by the parking place or
[SPEAKER_00]: right there where you enter the grocery
store in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices for these places,
the rent for them, they are extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big competition for these
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pay really much for the renting
this place, you really also have to sell a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of berries to cover the cost for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how it has turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are marketplaces in almost
every city in Finland or a town in
[SPEAKER_00]: Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a central square with a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of berries, vegetables,
plants are sold there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very popular places, especially
in summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major problem in growing
strawberries is gray mout, or through this
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a way to control gray mout
also biologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gliocladium catenolatum fungus,
which is applied as a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you set powder here in front of the
beehive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when bees come out of their hive,
they have to go through this powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they transport this powder in their
fur to the flowers, which they pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that way, this fungus is
distributed all around the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has proven to be quite efficient in
controlling gray mout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can then also be used in organic
farming, because it's a biological agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem that we encountered about
four years ago is phytophthora fragariae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was found in many Finnish
strawberry fields during one very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very rainy summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found out that it had come with
the plants from the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when it is there in the fields,
you won't get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers have to learn to live with
that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strawberry is not a very cold-hearted
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the strawberry crowns can only
tolerate temperatures until minus 10
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the growth will just decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at minus 12, minus 14, the crowns
would die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, in January, there was
almost no snow at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the temperature dropped to minus
35 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's minus 31 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there was no snow cover,
there were really, really bad damages to
[SPEAKER_00]: many strawberry fields around Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how these injured crowns would
then look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after this major frost damage during
winter, this last summer was very rainy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some rain almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were really big problems with
gray mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens now, more and more,
the growers are moving their strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are cultivated in soilless
cultivation, usually, using peat bags like
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a Frigo plant, A-plus plant,
coming from Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it is planted in this peat bag,
after two weeks, it will look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really starts to grow quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 60 days, it will produce yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are Sonata strawberry plants in peat
bags, high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eliani, also in high tunnels, peat bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry plants are also cultivated on
tabletop cultivation, which makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to pick them and do all kinds of
management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these nets are there to support the
flower trusses when they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they are full of berries,
they are very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can break if there is no support
for the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers also use coco coir instead of
peat in soilless cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strawberries are also produced year
round in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the market for this kind of berries is
quite limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: As there is a general trend in Europe to
get rid of peat in horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production, we have also studied different
alternative growth substrates that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be used in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we tested red canary grass straw
in growing strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that the strawberries
could manage just fine in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as water and nutrients are
provided through drip irrigation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really care where their roots
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of research now going on
and looking for these alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates to substitute peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second most important crops
cultivated in Finland are blackcurrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is greencurrant, which is similar
to blackcurrant in taste, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: tart as blackcurrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redcurrants, reddutch is the main
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whitecurrants, whitedutch is the main
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these have been traditionally
cultivated for processing industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: not for fresh market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how blackcurrant bush would
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing on raised bed also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the row would be covered by black
plastic or mypex mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is grass between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a blackcurrant field in
Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks pretty much similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cultivar bentroon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are mechanically harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonas is a berry harvester manufactured in
Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be used to harvest different
currant species and also blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how blackcurrants look like
after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mainly used for producing jam,
juice, or wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackcurrant really has a very good aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good tasting berry,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the price for processing
berries has gone down quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the cheap import from Poland,
many of these berry farms that have
[SPEAKER_00]: produced berries for processing had to
find new ways to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have turned into wineries,
berry wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they produce and sell berry wines
on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the price for blackcurrant in
fresh market has more than doubled during
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because people are more and
more interested in healthy diets and
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming these healthy berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blackcurrant is extremely rich in
antioxidants and many vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, we have to find new
varieties that can be grown for a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: market, because our traditional varieties
like Öyjöbyn is more suited for processing
[SPEAKER_00]: in fresh market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are testing Scottish
blackcurrant varieties that are prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for fresh market use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One possibility to produce currants for
fresh market is this cordon training
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you harvest the currants as whole
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pack them in small clam shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the price can be much, much higher
than for processing berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a very, very long shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a special way of pruning and
training the bushes so that they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: these long clusters filled with big
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have examined this way of training
currants with whitecurrant cultivars last
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed to function fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There on the right side, you see the
comparison of the berry cluster from the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally brewed bush, the upper one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower one is from the bush that
was trained using this cordon training
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gooseberries are not commercially
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mainly grown in home gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their popularity also seems to be
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see if they become more
important commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these currant species are very easy to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very well suited to northern
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But red raspberry is growing on its
northern limit in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we grow floricane cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot grow primocane cultivars because
our growing season is too short for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also raspberries are usually grown on
raised beds covered with black plastic or
[SPEAKER_00]: mypex mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is grass sown between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you see overwintering raspberry
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cultivars which we grow in
Finland, the major cultivars are muskouka
[SPEAKER_00]: and ottava.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very old Canadian cultivars,
which nobody else knows anymore even.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are the only ones that are winter
hardy enough in our conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not very high yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berries are quite small, although they
are very good tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now many of the growers have started
with this Scottish cultivar, Glen Ample,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has very big, nice berries and is
also very high yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with Glen Ample is that
two winters out of five, it would look
[SPEAKER_00]: like this in summer and spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these overwintering canes that
should produce crop this summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have died during winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the Finnish cultivar Takalan
Herkku, which seems to be doing just fine
[SPEAKER_00]: after this harsh winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the raspberry growers are also
moving their plants into high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly because of berry
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries are extremely perishable
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they are grown in high tunnels
where they are not exposed to rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit quality and shelf life are much,
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be infested with grahamout
after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the yields are higher and the
working conditions are much nicer inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are raspberries in the tunnel
planted in soil and in substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Norway, I think they are growing
all of the raspberries in tunnels now,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of the post-harvest quality
and better shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long cane plants are used for production
in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are one year old canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower initials are differentiated in
these parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are stored in freezing
temperatures, just like the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were, and get dormant until they
are planted in the field or in high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: or in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they produce yield about three
months after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how a raspberry long cane
plant would look like when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's planted in this kind of pot,
in coco coir usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water and nutrients are provided
through drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the plants are in high tunnel,
starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have more canes, like here
are four canes in this kind of container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see this white plastic net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will provide support to the laterals
when the laterals start to grow out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are heavy with berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would break without the support of
this provided by this net.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of coco coir bags
that can be used for planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dry cake of coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ready in this plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just add some water and then you plant
your raspberries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a raspberry grower and he is
explaining how happy he is with his
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries growing in a tunnel now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has four tunnels and 140 pickers
picking his raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glen ample raspberries and he is happy
with the quality and yield he is now
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the growers would buy new plants
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after planting these long cane plants
in high tunnel and harvesting the yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they just compost the plants and next
spring they order new plants again from
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands or England.
[SPEAKER_00]: New plants coming to the farm and that way
it's easier to handle pests and diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our studies we wanted to look if it
is possible to control the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry using a photo selective film
because raspberry grows very vigorously
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a very vegetative plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had raspberries growing in two
tunnels covered with a clear film and then
[SPEAKER_00]: this photo selective film and we found out
that it was useful for controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of primocane raspberries and also
yield potential was increased but it could
[SPEAKER_00]: not be used for growing primocanes of
biennial raspberries because their flower
[SPEAKER_00]: development was impaired in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall the effects were not that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also studied root frost hardiness
in plants because if the raspberry plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are over wintered like this then the root
systems are exposed to low temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and the roots are usually more susceptible
to cold than the canes and they may make
[SPEAKER_00]: it damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: After an artificial freezing test we found
out that Glen ample, the Scottish
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, suffered a lot of damage also at
minus 10 degrees whereas these hardy
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars Maurin Macca and Muskoka they
did fine until minus 18 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the growers are using susceptible
cultivars like Glen ample they should
[SPEAKER_00]: really pay attention for protecting them
during winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also studied the effect of high
tunnel conditions on berry quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the health related bioactive
substances in raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three different cultivars growing
in a tunnel and outside in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course the yields were much higher
inside the tunnel, almost double and also
[SPEAKER_00]: much earlier in the tunnel than in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly we found that berry
bioactive substances like phenolic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and antioxidant activity they
were not affected by tunnel growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the differences between the cultivars
were much more pronounced than the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences caused by the different
growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are studying whether we could grow
these primocane raspberry cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are too late for our conditions,
whether we could grow them as primocane
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seven different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew the canes in the tunnel,
they were over wintered and then they were
[SPEAKER_00]: brought back to the tunnel again the next
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is my student measuring the
plants, a lot of plants to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to produce the summer crop of
these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out, the berry quality
in some of these cultivars is just very
[SPEAKER_00]: good, but we are still analyzing the
results to see if the timing of yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of yield is sufficient for
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now I have to skip some of the slides
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow some blueberries in Finland as
well, but it's a rather new crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has only expanded recently when some of
the Finnish cultivars have been produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by the breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has been a little bit difficult to
market these berries because we also have
[SPEAKER_00]: this wild blueberry, Vakkinium myrtilus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when marketing these berries I think
one should distinguish between our wild
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry and these high bush blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one thing I should mention is that
we have the so-called everyman's right in
[SPEAKER_00]: Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to translate that
correctly, but it means that everybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: a right everywhere in Finland to go to the
forest and harvest wild berries or
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms or whatever, regardless of whose
forest it is, as long as you don't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody's front yard or backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people really harvest these wild
blueberries in the wild and somehow it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to understand why you should pay
for buying your blueberries on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lingonberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only grown in the wild and it grows
everywhere in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average total yield is estimated to be
250 million kilos and only about 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: per cent of the total yield is harvested
annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very easy to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use a hand-held rake like this and in
a few hours you can have like two 10-liter
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets full of berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also very easy to preserve
because it's very high in benzoic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to cook it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just smash the berries and then you
can store it in refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in a cool place and it keeps for a year
at least, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consume a lot of lingonberry jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually consumed with meat dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really Finnish specialty,
Arctic Bramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rubus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an indigenous plant in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows wild and it has always been
harvested from wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the places where this plant grows are
getting scarce because there are less cows
[SPEAKER_00]: going on the pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the places where this plant
likes to grow and produce berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been efforts to cultivate
this berry for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there have also been a lot of problems
when you move a wild plant from the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: to a field where it's a monoculture
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of problems used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially then rice, diseases,
pests, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the berries are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are expensive because they are
used for making this liquor, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: popular and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this berry, it has a very distinctive
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot mimic it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the company who makes this liquor or
jams, they really want to buy all the
[SPEAKER_00]: berries they can just get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is how the Arctic Bramble
field would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picking cost is also very high because the
berries are quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the harvest season is long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have studied the biology of this plant,
including flower induction, dormancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fruit sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have also studied soil-less
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We studied the possibility of improving
fruit set in Arctic Bramble by using
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-stimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these products proved to be
efficient in improving fruit set and fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are continuing this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bio-stimulants can be used in
organic growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now recently we have studied soil-less
cultivation of Arctic Bramble using grow
[SPEAKER_00]: towers and different substrates,
peat, coir, and sphagnum peat moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even wood shavings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sphagnum peat moss is now,
it's very popular to study that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that it could very well be
used as a substitute for peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it renews much more quickly in the
nature than peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a more ecological alternative for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the Arctic Bramble plants just
recently planted in this grow tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are in high tunnel now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is cloudberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wildberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not cultivated, but it's another
rubus species related to Arctic Bramble
[SPEAKER_00]: and raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are also quite expensive,
but they are only harvested from wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show you because it's a
beautiful plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have wild cranberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a species grown in Finland,
but it's a Vakinium oxycoccus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is harvested from wild,
but you see that these berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: they form and they are almost inside this
sphagnum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's very cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil might be frozen when you pick
them, and it's very tough work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several people have tried to grow
American cranberry species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vakinium macrocarbon in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the efforts have not been very
successful because our growing season is
[SPEAKER_00]: too short for your cranberry to be grown
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have taken a different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are now trying to grow American
cranberry in high tunnels in these hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: baskets and also using different growth
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are from last summer,
these pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pilgrim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, I think, seven different cultivars
from here, from the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are now growing nicely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to compete with the
cranberry production here in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the aim is more like produce a niche
crop, very expensive, healthy berries sold
[SPEAKER_00]: in small containers for the high price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are very much interested
also in buying more and eating more
[SPEAKER_00]: cranberries in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will see how this will work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then I would just like to
acknowledge the people I work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: several students at the University of
Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I collaborate with the researchers at
the Natural Research Institute Finland,
[SPEAKER_00]: LUKE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And researchers at the University of
Eastern Finland as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my funding sources are
mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer if you have any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between European gooseberry species,
which are not resistant to powder mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm the right person to
answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe it's just tradition of
growing some certain species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you answer that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel probably more than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just that we have to modify the
soil, the sulfur, lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, Finland is very much
environmentally conscious country and
[SPEAKER_01]: people are really, they want free water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now we're seeing all this plastic
coming into agriculture, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes seen as not very environmentally
friendly to use plastic mulches and
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic cones and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the reaction of the public to more
of this greenhouse and plastic in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there has been a lot of
discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This black plastic mulch on strawberry
fields, they have been used forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody questions that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now these high tunnels, it's a
relatively new thing, but it's also that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a big country, a lot of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farms would usually be in the middle
of the forest somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow people don't, you don't see that
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maybe it doesn't bother you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought about that when I was
visiting Norway and in Norway they really
[SPEAKER_00]: have these mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see really far and somehow it's a
very traditional landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have a lot of these very
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this nice view,
open view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a huge concentration of
plastic tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, it did not look very good,
but it's different in Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are hide hidden in inside the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there really hasn't been a lot
of discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been distinguished between peat and
sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is the peat that you were mentioning,
is that reed peat or sedge peat?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the difference between that
peat and the sphagnum peat?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sphagnum peat is a plant that is still
growing and you harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called sphagnum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You harvest it and you dry it and you can
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that as a growth substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And peat that is traditionally used is
this composted that has been composting in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would imagine that the peat that
you're talking about is sphagnum peat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the length of the growing season
in southern Finland?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 180 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Alina, we thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
