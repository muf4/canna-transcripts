[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for inviting me up to
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get started, I know we've got
some, at least one retailer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many growers are in the audience?
Landscapers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Educators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Master gardeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm very pleased to talk to you
about pollinators because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can all, we can definitely all
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to Carol was very helpful to
see, you know, where is our gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: public going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who do we need to reach out to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just coming about three weeks ago from the
International Pollinator Conference at
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State, I can tell you that the
pollinator crisis is very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that we have to address
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the good news is that all of us
here working in the screen industry can be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, listening to Carol,
I was thinking about the connection with
[SPEAKER_00]: kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's a more wonderful connection
than plants, butterflies, bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things that move, because kids
love this kind of thing, and food
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do, I'm going to kind of
take you through a quick introduction for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you who might not be terribly
familiar with pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the stressors on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the important part, what can we
do to help them with our floral resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of you guys know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are pollinators important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to eat watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to eat squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to eat blueberries and apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all things that are insect
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without these, our diets become very
bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an economic value going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without pollinators, we definitely have
some economic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without pollination of plants,
we have no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no berries, which means we have no
food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything really does collapse,
which is why we call pollinators keystone
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot pull these guys out and still
have all of us survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when you're gardening for
pollinators and you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for them, it's important to know
who our pollinators are because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just honey bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very wide range of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these guys use something just
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flies, I know flies aren't a big sell
to the public, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surfer fly over here on the left,
sometimes also called hoverfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very frequent flower visitors,
and they do their share of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a bonus, their larvae are wonderful
aphid eaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got beneficial insects going on
here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pachnid fly, not quite as pretty over
on the left, or excuse me, on your right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pachnid fly is actually very
important because it's a parasitoid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brown marmorated stink bug, lays its eggs
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pollinators that are visiting
these plants have more benefit than just
[SPEAKER_00]: moving pollen and nectar or moving pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beetles, very frequent flower visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many people bring
these into the office after they've killed
[SPEAKER_00]: them because they've said they're on my
flowers and must be doing something bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this soldier beetle is actually
another beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually does eat some aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a flower visitor, it's moving some
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butterflies and moths, easy sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe post your child for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as efficient because their legs hold
them above the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not moving around as much
pollen, but they're absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely have another role in the
environment, and that's their caterpillars
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding birds, which is supporting the
whole food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking to people about
pollinators, sometimes this is the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them into pollinator gardening because
who doesn't love butterflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very beloved pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that cardinal flower and
this beebomb monarda would be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that in our Master Gardener plant
sales because people want to support these
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the hymenoptera,
the wasps and the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, if you have pollinator-friendly
plants, you are going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are solitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the yellow jacket type social
wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're solitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female's doing all of her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's far too busy to even think about
stinging.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are ground nesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually one we've been doing some
work on at our pollinator plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bicertes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a ground nester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during her lifetime, which is very
short, she can kill and take back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nest 40 brown marmorated stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flower visitors, but they're also
performing other functions for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our main pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bees are very effective at
pollination because they are collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other visitors are strictly getting
nectar and kind of accidentally moving
[SPEAKER_00]: things with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have to collect pollen to take
back to the nest to feed their larva,
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed the young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very well-adapted for it with
their bodies and pollen collectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's familiar with honeybees,
but not everybody knows that honeybees are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a farmed bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not considered wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were brought over from Europe with
the Jamestown settlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been an economic farm product
ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: What folks aren't too familiar with is the
native bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before these honeybees were brought over,
pollination was happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great ecosystem going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are over 20,000 species
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here in the mid-Atlantic region,
we figured in Pennsylvania we have about
[SPEAKER_00]: 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discovering new species every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because until we had the problem with
pollinators, nobody was doing a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now with everything being geared
up, we are learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these species are very, very varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of bees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumblebees most people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a social bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The queen actually has workers in a small
colony in the ground, maybe 250 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these other bees, these bees are
solitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the queen is doing all of her own
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might only be laying 10, 12 eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might be laying them in the ground in
hollow stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might be using dead wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these nesting sites become
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bees vary from the pretty large
carpenter bee down to the tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat bee that is really difficult to
identify when they're on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bees that are specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important when we're thinking
about what we're planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squash bee on your left over here
actually nests underneath squash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need honey bees if you're
growing squash, because if you plant it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your farming practices are not
disturbing their nests, they will be there
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males fall asleep in the flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are very, very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take care of your crop for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a native bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mining bee on the right I put in here
because there is a particular mining bee
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a specialist on goldenrod that the
way it collects pollen and its collectors
[SPEAKER_00]: only fit one size of pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from goldenrod or aster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without goldenrod or aster,
those bees are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these specialist bees are not as
common, but they have a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to keep the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other bees have a really wide floral
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumblebees are this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wonderful little leaf cutter bee can
go from one species to another and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we visit many, many different
families of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need both of these groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad news is pollinators are declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a rather steep decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 34 animals identified as
pollinators that are endangered or
[SPEAKER_00]: threatened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at the number of flowering
species that are also endangered or
[SPEAKER_00]: threatened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the relationship between the flowers
and their pollinators is very tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if you lose a floral
resource, you're going to lose a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a concerning issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last winter, honeybees declined
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our farmed bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost 45%, 15% loss is what they
normally would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been going on now for quite a
few years, ever since we've heard about
[SPEAKER_00]: the colony collapse disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our wild bees are also in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might never have known this if colony
collapse hadn't happened with the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may never have actually started to
study these other bees, but we've got at
[SPEAKER_00]: least five species of our North American
bumblebees that are shrinking in range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this is due to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other reasons as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 out of 46 species of our bumblebees are
now threatened or near threatened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not good news, because the
bumblebee globally is our second most
[SPEAKER_00]: important pollinator of crops,
second only to that farmed honeybee that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being taken around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then butterflies, wow, 141 different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: At risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the latest one that everybody
knows about is the monarch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what in the world is going on with our
pollinators?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is stressing them out so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is no one smoking gun to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do research on these
wonderful, you know, wonderful creatures
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so many factors coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that habitat nutrition is one,
pesticide exposure, we've got diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, funguses out there, past
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that climate change is playing a
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when these all come together,
it's somewhat of a recipe for disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about these two,
the pesticides and the nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are things we can do
something about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of this we have to kind of leave
to the researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And habitat loss is huge, both of nesting
habitat, you know, they can't nest in
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch, they can't nest in thick turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our gardening practices are kind of
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've fragmented our landscape so much
that some of these insects can't fly
[SPEAKER_00]: across some of the more urban areas that
we've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a noted ecologist down in Arizona has
determined over 95 percent of the land in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower 48 states is either in
agriculture or development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't leave a whole lot for our
pollinator friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our farming practices in the Midwest
have changed drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know this is a definite problem for
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vast fields of monocultures,
you know, hedgerows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator strips, you know, there's just
nothing there for the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the Northeast, we're a little
better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our farms are smaller,
we still do have hedgerows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, you know, forest lands in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're definitely, we're definitely
better here than in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our suburban areas are the other part of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As natural fields and forests are plowed
down or taken down for development for
[SPEAKER_00]: homes and businesses, what we put back in
our yards does not begin to satisfy the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our turf, our plants, which we're
importing mostly from other countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: just not a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even our campuses, as beautiful as our
own Penn State campus is, when I walk
[SPEAKER_00]: around, I see a lot of places where,
you know, we could do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could be putting in more floral
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be filling this up with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[SPEAKER_00]: We fill everything with flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the natural lands that are left
have been overrun with invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have a talk on that a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a state forest in Pennsylvania,
which is being overrun by Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: steelgrass and Japanese barberry that has
escaped from our yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get that kind of monoculture
in the forest crowding out, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wildflowers are pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pollinators have trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are a tough issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not an expert on pesticides,
so I'll kind of relay to you what our
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Pollinator Research has found
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that pesticides are part of this
whole problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that whatever we put down,
pollinators pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a study back around 2007,
of pollen samples, we found out that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were 121 different pesticides identified
in wax and pollen samples from honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we put it out, they're picking it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were very few samples that didn't
have anything in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the 121 different ones,
here is a list of some of the categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some very familiar pesticides
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure what percentage,
but we can find that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked what percentage of the samples
did not have any detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says very few, but I don't have that
actual percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have systemics out there that are
getting into pollen to nectar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the pollinators are getting them that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And per pollen sample, each one had an
average of six different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very eye-opening for our
researchers to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many samples they looked
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the Center for Pollinator Research,
we can get that from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many samples they sampled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whether they were looking at pollen
and wax, they were looking at them both
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the systemics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize, I don't have all of those
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Marianne Frazier, who was our
researcher at Penn State that did this,
[SPEAKER_00]: she has since retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all available at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys want that, I can try to
get more of the total study for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have an idea of what all the
parameters were.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I just wanted to bring to
your attention is there are different
[SPEAKER_00]: modes of action of these pesticides with
the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lethal means, well, carbaryl is a good
example, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spray it, they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They immediately die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are sublethal effects as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the four that are listed here,
reduced immune function, reduced lifespan,
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired foraging behavior, reduced
reproduction, which one do you think would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a sublethal effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a difficult thing to study,
but there are many, many studies out there
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes, when they're exposed to
these pesticides, you don't get an
[SPEAKER_00]: outright kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are impaired in such a way that
the colony eventually is affected or the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual may die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick word about neonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, my expertise is in the plants,
not so much in the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have found sublethal effects from
the neonics and impaired foraging
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior, the decreased reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the recommendation that is coming
out is don't use neonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use neonics prophylactically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing a lot of the plants
that we're going to be talking about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few minutes, there's no need to be using
anything in them because these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so wherever you can, especially with
pollinator plants, try to stay away from
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also discovered that fungicides play
a role here, which really complicates
[SPEAKER_00]: things, especially for the orchard folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fungicides can actually synergize
with some of the insecticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the three listed here,
and become stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also don't know what the inert
ingredients of the pesticides do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some researchers looking at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in those inert ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can they affect pollinators?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the pesticides, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicides play a role, too, in that by
spraying our roadsides or median strips,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're killing off a lot of our floral
resources, reducing habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lawns, violets are a good early
season source of nectar for bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: host plant for the fritillary butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover, which used to be a mainstay in our
lawns back, my grandfather always seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: clover into his lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, in this generation,
clover is a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of made it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clover is a wonderful source for bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the herbicides can do some damage to
us, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in general, these are some of the
recommendations that the Center came out
[SPEAKER_00]: with for protecting pollinators from
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how toxic it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's not so easy, because
what's toxic to a honeybee might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic to a bumblebee, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never use pesticides on blooming
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pre-bloom, don't use the
systemics, because some of these can
[SPEAKER_00]: linger in the plant for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad news, but there's good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this international conference,
this last month, the one theme that came
[SPEAKER_00]: through of so many of the papers was that
even in the presence of diseases and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of pesticides, if these
pollinators were well fed, if they had
[SPEAKER_00]: good nutrition, they could fight off some
of these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no different from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're run down, we don't have a good
diet, we don't have a diverse diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can easily pick up a cold, pick up a
flu, pick up anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can really make a difference,
even in the face of the other things
[SPEAKER_00]: they're facing, by giving them a diverse
diet, by giving them what they really
[SPEAKER_00]: need, the best possible nectar,
the best possible pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can dilute some of these compounds and
dilute the effects of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I kind of came away from that
conference feeling like, yes, what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the green industry responds to
this really can make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other good news is the gardeners that
I talked to are aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're kind of tied into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those new gardeners that Carol was
talking about, they want their kids to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tied in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that we have some environmental
problems going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're anxious for the kids to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a wonderful learning opportunity
that could be paired with our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are hungry and providing food
is also a very feel-good thing for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be lucrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan State just did a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually on the labeling of
plants treated with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study found that plants that were
labeled bee-friendly, as being grown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bee-friendly way, were much preferred by
the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are responding to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also found out that people are
willing to pay a little more for a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was grown in a bee-friendly way,
up to a dollar more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an opportunity there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming, because of how consumers
are reacting, that they would react the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way to not just plants that were
grown in a pollinator-friendly way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but growing plants that are truly,
really nutritious and good for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the labeling of these plants would
definitely be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all kinds of things you could
do in a garden center to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big question is, what are the best
pollinator plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still trying to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some of our modern hybrids
that are being developed, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the annual world, are being developed for
color or size or just appeal, may or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have pollen or nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the nectaries are bred out of
the plants, so the pollen is bred out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the plant can become so
complicated in structure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator has no idea how to get to the
pollen that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at our native plants,
they have been co-evolved to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to show you some here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are just saying, hey guys,
your pollinators may not be too smart
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a plant like this, it's a little
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down at our Penn State Research
Station, near where I live in Landisville,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have our flower trials,
the Center for Pollinator Research has set
[SPEAKER_00]: up a row for pollinator insect study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've taken some of the most common
good sellers at garden centers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the researchers from the center are
coming down and evaluating them for
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing a pollinator visitation,
which I'm really glad they're doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nothing wrong with having a plant
in your garden that doesn't attract
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators, but we also need to be
including plants that do attract
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know from our studies that most
native perennials are good pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Karen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing existing varieties that are
at garden centers in this test?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what they chose when
availability was part of the issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, when they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they go forward, they're going to
target specific plants a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to see what are the best sellers
out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are people buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we label them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we label these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most native perennial plants, we know,
are good for pollinators because they
[SPEAKER_00]: co-evolve together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without their pollinators, these plants
wouldn't have made it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we change them and we create
cultivars from them, what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left is a straight species of
echinacea, our coneflower, and boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pollinator heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is another one in our trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't spent much time over there
looking, but the few times that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: over, I haven't seen any pollinators on
that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we've changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anything still there?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things we need to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mount Cuba is doing some great studies
down at the university, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Delaware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Delaney and one of her grad
students, Owen Cass, have been looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: Monardas and Choriopsis and trying to
determine which ones of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: attracting pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're even looking at the nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're analyzing the nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have the proteins and the lipids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have what pollinators really need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking at a lot of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever get down there,
it's a really neat place to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do have some reports out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also just looking at the plants
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones are the most attractive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones hold up the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pollinator study is now a little
addition to all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these reports are online.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their Choriopsis report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owen should be putting his Monarda report
out pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we did a trial study at
our research station, 2012 to 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we looked at 84 different species of
native plants and their cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were replicated in five-by-five
plots, three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had master gardeners helping us
with this, as well as our researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go into the results of that
study, which is what your handout is all
[SPEAKER_00]: about, for those of you that are
landscapers, just wanted to mention a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things about how we can make some changes
in our landscaping to help out the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are three properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the top is about 35 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been landscaped in native plants,
unprofessionally done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the pool area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a wonderful floral
resource for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But down on the bottom left is a small
garden in the city of York, postage stamp
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look what she's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has put a lot of wonderful floral
resources in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still has a little bit of lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's beauty year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, three seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, this is a nursing
home, also in York County, where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: taken grass and they've turned it into a
therapeutic place for their residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place of beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place alive with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place for the pollinators that the
residents are lining up to get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: nursing home, because they want to be able
to look out on this wonderful courtyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So size doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every space that we have can be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what all three of these places have in
common is they have put plants closer
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plants touching each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have reduced use of mulch and
landscape fabric, because they can't nest
[SPEAKER_00]: with landscape fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by packing in our plants,
letting them touch, letting them be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more natural, weed-free,
there's no space there for weeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really big help as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still maintenance, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a different kind of maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In really large areas, landscape plugs can
be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is if you're placing plants,
you know, two, three feet apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: but have a need for mulch, you don't have
many floral resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have weeds growing down
through that mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nesting sites become limited, because bees
can't, the ground nesters can't go down
[SPEAKER_00]: through the mulch or the landscape fabric.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a cost saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a group that said they had
spent $15,000 for their homeowners
[SPEAKER_00]: association on mulch last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, but they were wondering
how they could get more flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, take that $15,000 and
maybe move it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things are kind of a negative
when we're talking about pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the front of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So landscape plugs are a really
cost-effective way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're landscaping, they can be a
dollar a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are native plant wholesalers that
are growing these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling to keep up because
there's a demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody looking for a niche market,
maybe might be a place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plugs can also be purchased and
potted up into quarts and sold at garden
[SPEAKER_00]: centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a source for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also seed sources out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are collecting local
ecotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, when you're placing these,
diversity is really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that plants, pollinators and
their plants are closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this penstemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This penstemon isn't letting anything go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a landing pad for the bumblebee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these plants is going to
attract a different kind of pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: because they all have different sized
tongues and different needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversity is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get people to planting
groups and drifts because one single plant
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to help a pollinator too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll see a mass much better and
have plants to move between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succession of bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants from spring through fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different kinds of bees emerging
in March and the whole way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: season until the first really hard frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all need food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So picking a succession of bloom,
it also means, hey, we're getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're selling more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're enjoying more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing more color in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the results of the 84 species
that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the full results on your papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to touch on a few of these
plants for the sake of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we discovered that plants with
large compound inflorescences of tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers attracted more different kinds of
pollinators than other flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we got our diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think swamp milkweed over here on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boneset in the middle, which is one of the
epitoriums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joe Pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many flowers out there
that have these kind of flower heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the only thing you should
plant, but if you're trying to get a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to a new gardener, see the biggest bang
for their buck, these are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to start with our
number one winner right off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pycnanthemum muticum, the clustered
mountain mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody growing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of pollinators?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mint family in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mint family, the astra family are both
huge families for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a native mint, but yes,
other mints will do well too if you let
[SPEAKER_00]: them flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this clustered mountain mint was a
plant that we felt could be a gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for the garden as well as valuable
for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 21 different kinds of pollinators
visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: From butterflies to flies to beetles to
bees to wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed as though you could tell where
it was in the child plot because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: this buzz over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually had one educator come visit
our plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about the plot before we
went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me later, if you hadn't told me
that that was a good thing, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: made a big berth around that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, because there was so much stuff
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, now I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need some education too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only grows about three to four feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does like some soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a plant for real dry soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an advantage over the other plants
because it bloomed for 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were counting pollinators for a
lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best juices I've seen for this
plant was at Irvine Nature Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a parking lot divider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only downside to having that was
when people were getting in their cars
[SPEAKER_00]: with their purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get their cameras out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd be taking pictures of buckeyes
and all kinds of taking 20 minutes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, in the three years,
well five years now, that Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardeners, about 20 of them, have been
working in this child plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been not a single sting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the females can sting of the wasps
and the bees because it's the over
[SPEAKER_00]: closeter that's the stinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males can't sting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who has time on their hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: The males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females are doing all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to get the nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to get the palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to feed the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could care less about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are kind of hanging around and
being a little aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden rods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to, I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see, anybody here growing
golden rods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden rods are an extremely important
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really tied for number one with that
mountain mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stiff golden rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butterflies loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a project with the Xerces
Society right now to find out what nectar
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the monarch is using on its trek
from Canada to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're strongly suspecting that golden
rod has historically always been one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuels to help them get down to their
wintering grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so many butterflies on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really stands up very tall and will
withstand some medium to dry soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blooming as we speak and just
attracts so many different pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be great for back of the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: After five years, we're learning which
plants stayed in place and which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places, seeding around would be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of a homeowner, they might not
like it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, got another golden rod for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just kind of grows out from a
center patch and forms a larger patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You divide it and you can keep it in
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the golden rods were very good for
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to dispel the fact that
people think that golden rod is an
[SPEAKER_00]: allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insect-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not get carried by wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ragweed is the culprit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to England last fall,
I saw more golden rod in Garden of Zorby
[SPEAKER_00]: there than I ever see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a love affair with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't because it's become
invasive for them because they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecosystem built around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is Shakespeare's birthplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing use of golden rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling it back to us,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's their award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another wonderful, wonderful pollinator
plant attracted a lot of those parasitoids
[SPEAKER_00]: with the brown marmorated stink bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy-to-grow plant, likes dry soil
and full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these native plants ever need
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, fertilizer is counterproductive
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are adapted for nutrient-poor soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joe pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them were wonderful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cultivars, all the straight
species did very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I singled out dubium because it was our
number one plant for attracting
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over three years, we had 17 different
butterflies and skippers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the last one to bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually a plant of the coastal
plain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the shortest of all the joe pies,
which is always popular with homeowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the joe pies, average to moist
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is just beginning to bloom now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamp milkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a garden center, milkweeds are
so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: At our plant sales, at our office,
we can hardly get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers are having trouble keeping
them in stock because everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: about the monarch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even common milkweed is flying off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swamp milkweed is a great plant for
all kinds of pollinators, including a good
[SPEAKER_00]: nectar plant for the monarch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they love to lay their eggs on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does need moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other milkweeds that can be
grown that need other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a milkweed for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rattlesnake master, pretty cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody growing this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a bit of a surprise to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little surprised to see how good
it was as a pollinator plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those tiny little flowers were
attracting a lot of different diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was interested to see the new formal
garden by the mansion at Mount Cuba
[SPEAKER_00]: Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have incorporated rattlesnake master
into their garden as a structural element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have time for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the cultivar sheet there for
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the straight species of
Monarda pestilosa against Claire Grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we discovered is that the
straight species was very much preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is about Claire
Grace, that the butterflies or the bees
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't prefer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it was just the fact that we had
so much food available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this, you'll see on your sheets,
is a terrific plant for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six different kinds of bumblebees on here,
hummingbird moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you plant it with other plants so that
if it does get powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it with its friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another cultivar comparison between
the aromatic asters, three different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, you'll see that the
cultivar October skies was preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were surprised to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it actually did better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a shorter variety than the
straight species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did not seem to seed around very much,
which was kind of a plus two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at coreopsis,
three different types of coreopsis,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the straight species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after three years, Zagreb had done
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly because it had more flowers on it
than the straight species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was interesting, we're five years
into this, we're not counting pollinators
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plants any longer, but the plants
are still in the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after five years, Zagreb is starting
to fade under the weed pressure at the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can, you know, I only have 20
master gardeners, and trying to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: these weeds out of there is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of left moon being go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just isn't, it's still there,
but it doesn't have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zagreb is fading a little bit,
but the straight species, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do much to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just interesting watching what
happens over time with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give a shout out to this
particular plant the Monarda Peters Fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuchsia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not 100% sure of the parentage of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody knows, I'd like to know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our trials, it was a favorite of
bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would hang on to it to the very
last, you know, last flower, till it just
[SPEAKER_00]: about was ready to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our trials has really held up under
all this weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just feel it's a really good garden
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that came out of this
trial is a phenology chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept track of the bloom for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not in your handout or on the
website, but if you want it, I can send it
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, prints large, because it's
84 different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a really handy thing to have if
you want to think about planting that
[SPEAKER_00]: succession of bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really, I mean, all the
plants in our plot did pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see the full report,
you can go to the Center for Pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: Research website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the pollinator garden certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a master gardener program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under step one, provide food for
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link to bees, bugs,
and blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a card up here with the website
on it if you're interested.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, together, I mean,
this is a feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because getting plants out there and
getting plants in the hands of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: kids is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, helping pollinators at the same time
is even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, collectively, I think we can
make a real difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
