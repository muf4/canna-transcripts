[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the initial excitement wears off,
when people come by to see the Titan Arum,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm often asked, why do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we study strange plants and unusual
plants like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grand scheme of things,
does it cure disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it help us increase crop yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it good for?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, studying plants like the Titan
Arum are simply representative of
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery-based science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know before we do studies what
we're going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the essence of exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Titan Arum and plants like it are
another kind of landscape to explore in
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural world, part of the wonders of
biological diversity across the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to give tangible examples to
people of what's interesting and useful
[SPEAKER_00]: about discovery-based science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start with the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its biology is unusual enough to cause us
to wonder, why would a plant marshal that
[SPEAKER_00]: much energy and devote that much of its
reproductive effort to being so large and
[SPEAKER_00]: so stinky and so hot for such a short
amount of time and then go several years
[SPEAKER_00]: between reproductive events instead of
doing it every year like migrating birds?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take a closer look at what the
plant is doing, it's attracting flies and
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles that are decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their ecological niche is to use rotting
materials as their food for their larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: and grubs, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hidden benefit from studying a plant
like the Titan Arum is it has been finely
[SPEAKER_00]: tuned by natural science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been selected to be attractive to
what some humans regard as pest insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow flies or screw worms are the kinds of
flies that lay eggs or larvae into rotting
[SPEAKER_00]: meat, or in some cases, in the case of
screw worms, into wounds of animals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: These animals are pests to agriculture
because they cause a lot of damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back in the really applied
scientific literature, you'll find Lucy
[SPEAKER_00]: lure and S-worm lure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are code names or trademarks for
volatile lures that people use to trap
[SPEAKER_00]: these flies and keep them away from their
livestock or keep them off of their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of research went into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had to test different combinations
of these noxious odors and the right
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and the right barcode to attract
these flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have figured that out already.
[SPEAKER_00]: One immediate benefit from studying plants
like this, which are so effective at
[SPEAKER_00]: trapping flies, is that they were the code
breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could simply copy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A form of engineering is biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of where does Velcro come from or
the feet of geckos that allow them to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: on slippery surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are large industries based on using
artificial materials to mimic what are
[SPEAKER_00]: very effective ruses and devices in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have picked the code of
female flies and beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use the same volatile compounds and
the same ratios that they make as lures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one example very close to what the
plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another layer of this,
another level of discovery that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the connections, the hidden
connections that we don't see coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example I like to use with my students
is to talk about modern genomic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge, huge part of the wedding
between technology and science and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and health is the idea that we
now have the technology to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes, not only the human genome,
but the genomes of other creatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogens that live in us,
the creatures that are helpful to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: the animals and plants that we've
domesticated, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole field, the whole edifice of the
science of genomics is built upon
[SPEAKER_00]: serendipitous discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to Balbiani, who was an
embryologist in France in the 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century, Balbiani studied something that
people would think was frivolous,
[SPEAKER_00]: the salivary chromosomes of midges,
kind of little fly, a mosquito-like fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balbiani was just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Balbiani discovered was that they
have these polytene chromosomes that puff
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first way to visualize genes
as beads on a string before better
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy and better genetic technologies
were developed in the early part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foundation of genetics as a field
rests on this kind of frivolous discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: by Balbiani about what salivary gland
chromosomes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in fruit flies as well as midges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were our first beads on a string in
genetic dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of rapidly amplifying
specific DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The invention came out in the late 80s
when I was a beginning student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember how fundamentally it changed
the field of genetics, but you can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR without Taq polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an enzyme, DNA polymerase enzyme,
that's taken from the DNA polymerase from
[SPEAKER_00]: an extremophile, a bacterium named Thermos
Aquaticus, that lives in hot springs in
[SPEAKER_00]: places like Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would study that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frivolous to go on a boondoggle with
government money to a national park and
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop out bacteria from hot springs,
except it isn't frivolous because Thermos
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaticus has to do DNA replication in 70
or 80 degrees centigrade water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common bacteria can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carey Mullis and the inventors of
polymerase chain reaction realized through
[SPEAKER_00]: a long series of papers that were
published over a decade and a half that
[SPEAKER_00]: Taq polymerase was the tool they needed to
solve the problem of rapid cycling of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, to visualize, you know,
transformative genetics, you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter genes, and people have used all
kinds of different reporter genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the one that's really made a
difference is green fluorescent protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Nobel Prize given for this
discovery a few years ago, but it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would you ask the NIH to support
studies of jellyfish that light up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water column at night in the oceans?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's frivolous, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP is so incredibly important and useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And science is full of those kind of
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stinky plants that we're studying,
we don't know ahead of time whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give us a really valuable tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that it coordinates turning on
temperature and scent and opening and
[SPEAKER_00]: closing and its respiration, which is
really, really high for a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got molecular switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nano switches in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be so useful to apply what we
learn from these very, very specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to other plants that are important
to us in our daily lives.

Thank you.
