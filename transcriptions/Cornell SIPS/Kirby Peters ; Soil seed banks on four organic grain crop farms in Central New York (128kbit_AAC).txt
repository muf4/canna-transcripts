[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up today we have Kirby Peters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirby is from Roxbury, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with Matt Ryan, Jeff Liebert,
and Sandra Wayman in soil and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his post-graduation plans are to be a
greenhouse manager at Johnson's Backyard
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden in Austin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of Kirby's seminar is Soil Seed
Banks on Four Organic Grain Crop Farms in
[SPEAKER_01]: Central New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hello everyone again.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kirby Peters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an agricultural science student
graduating a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title of my project that I'll be
presenting to you today is The Soil Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Banks on Four Organic Grain Crop Farms in
Central New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thesis advisor again was Matthew
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I'm going to give you a quick
little outline of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we heard from several farmers that we
know is that red clover had been
[SPEAKER_00]: identified as a volunteer crop on several
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we decided to do was to sample
the weed seed bank in order to identify if
[SPEAKER_00]: there was truly a red clover seed bank
within the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we measured is the weed seed
density, the weed species richness,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red clover density, and lastly we
looked at the weed seed community as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I think we should talk about what
a soil weed seed bank is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a viable seed in the soil
that has the potential to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover specifically is what we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is extremely common in organic
agriculture mainly because organic
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture cannot use synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic growers tend to rely on
biological inputs such as red clover
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a legume and it can fix
nitrogen to the soil with its symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, here's a picture
of a clover in case you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, a few growers have
mentioned that they have seen this crop as
[SPEAKER_00]: a volunteer crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is basically the crop
has persisted past its time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clover can be frost seeded or can also
be seeded in the fall, go through winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then reemerge in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's then terminated in order to make room
for the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a grain as we like to say
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue with a volunteer crop is
then it persists past that and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still present in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people see this as a negative
implication because you have this red
[SPEAKER_00]: clover that's competing with your crop for
whatever resource, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, sunlight, or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this study kind of takes it into
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study looks at the possible benefit
of this volunteer red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's many benefits to red
clover itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it fixes nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we don't have to see seed red
clover, there's just this natural red
[SPEAKER_00]: clover seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save seed costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's less labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to make a trip into the
field to broadcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also potentially control the
emergence of your red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beneficial because there's times,
for example, wet times of the year when
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot get into your field because
it's too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you have this red clover seed
bank, it'll come up anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a nice benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to look at this red clover,
what we did is we looked at it within the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of the whole weed seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there, we decided just to make a
characterization of the whole weed seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we did the study over
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened, this occurred in 2015 and
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled four farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These farmers were chosen from our
advisory board and our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pretty experienced organic
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are organic growers that were some
of the first organic growers in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say they're experienced,
they're very experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're thankful for them to
volunteer for the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we asked each farmer to
pick three fields, their clean field,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high clover field, and a weedy field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea with this is when they chose,
for example, a high clover field,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be identifying a field with a red
clover seed bank present in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When farmers were choosing their clean
fields, generally they were picking fields
[SPEAKER_00]: that they observed low weed abundance in,
at least above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also they talked about how conducive
fields were for control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one farmer mentioned the friability of
the soil as making it more conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For high clover fields, farmers talked
about basically the presence it had in
[SPEAKER_00]: their rotation, but also all the farmers
were harvesting red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for these fields, they said they
noticed that a lot of seed was dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the soil, adding some red clover
seed into the soil seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, the weedy field, farmers chose
this generally because they had observed a
[SPEAKER_00]: high amount of abundance in these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they talked about how some of
these fields were not so conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some farmers talked about field being
really wet, and that kind of preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: them from getting into the fields and
controlling weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Potenza farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see he chose his weedy field
here, his high clover field, and lastly
[SPEAKER_00]: his clean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we did our soil
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we split each field into four
quadrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sampled each quadrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil sampling was done in early spring
before any weeds had merged.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, there are no weeds
present, no weeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil sampling was done with a soil
probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you see here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go eight inches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diameter of the probe was about 5
eighths of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did 30 soil cores per quadrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, what we would do with
the 30 soil cores is we would combine them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bucket, as you see here, to make one
composite sample per quadrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in all, we had four farms,
three fields, and four quadrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about 48 samples for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after two years, we had 96 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we had that composite sample,
what we did is we performed a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: germination bioessay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take one kilogram of soil from
each of those composite samples and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them into one of these trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each sample is represented in one of
these trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would allow the weed seed in the soil
to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we were able to identify,
we would identify them, count them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would identify them by genus and
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would do, this is just an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once these had germinated, we would
then identify them, count them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered one flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did two flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we identified, counted,
and removed, we then stirred, well mixed,
[SPEAKER_00]: watered, to hopefully stimulate some more
germination of weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, let them germinate,
identify, and remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we call it two flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to analyze this data,
we use analysis of variance or ANOVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to compare the means,
we use the Tukey Cramer method.
[SPEAKER_00]: We analyzed, like I said in the beginning,
weed seed density, which is just the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weed seedlings we observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed species richness, which is just the
amount of species per farm or per field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover density, which is just the
amount of red clover seedlings we
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the weed seed community,
which is just looking at all the species
[SPEAKER_00]: and abundance in all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first what we're looking at here is the
weed seed density we observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our response variable is the
soil weed seed bank density per seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to acknowledge that we
compared within farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just compared the weedy high clover
and clean within each farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different letters indicate a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NSC represents no significant
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main takeaways from this is we saw
a very large range of weed seed densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in the Martins high clover
field in 2015, right here, there was about
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,800 seedlings per meter squared
identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2016, in the Oshanara high
clover field, you can see it was much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 103,000 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very large range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing we took away from
this was that almost all the weedy fields
[SPEAKER_00]: had higher seed densities than the clean
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the one example that we didn't
see this was in the Meyer farm in 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there was no significant difference
between any of the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we're looking at the weed species
richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to acknowledge we're not
looking in a area variable now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking in a mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at species richness per
species per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a little more variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, between years, it stayed fairly
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here in Martins,
the weedy field had a higher species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness than the clean field in both
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Meyer, it stayed consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No significant difference between any of
the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with Oshanara.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the weedy field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an observed difference between
the weedy field and the clean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of variance we saw was
between the Potenza field, Potenza farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you saw the weedy field had a higher
richness than the clean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we didn't observe any difference
in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, we have the red clover density.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't as much variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, we didn't observe any
difference in the Martins farm between
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the Potenza.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we did notice we saw quite a bit
of difference in the Meyer farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: where in 2015 and 2016, the weedy fields
had a higher red clover density than the
[SPEAKER_00]: clean fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with the high clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other difference we saw was in
the Oshanara farm in 2015, where the weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: field had a higher red clover density than
both the high clover and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking at what we call the
weed seed bank community data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the species that make up the
top 75% of the abundance from each farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, we have the total
amount of abundance of the total weed seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we noticed from this is that there
was a lot of overlap of species between
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Path of Rush here and Path of
Rush here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see fleabane species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood sorrel and other wood sorrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some commonalities between a
lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were specific species that
were common on all farms or the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these examples were Purcell
and Speedwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it made up a high percentage
of Martins and the Oshanara farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lower percentage on the Potenza
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was still present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next example is giant foxtail,
which we found on a lot of farms in very
[SPEAKER_00]: high percentages, which you can see in the
Myers, Potenza, and Martins farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, red clover wasn't necessarily
a common species amongst all farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just for the sake of this
project, we should be pointing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the Martins farm,
we had about 3% of the total abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seed was red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really interesting in Myers'
farm we had about 18% of the total weed
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank density was red clover,
which is a high amount of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking at the 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see the same similar common
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giant foxtail, for example, is still
present in these three farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: 43% of the seed bank is now giant foxtail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, once again, it's still present
in the Martins and Potenza farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover, you can see now has
disappeared from the top 76% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Martins farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It decreased by half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Myers farm went from 18% to 9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it is present in the Potenza farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some variation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some conclusions from this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, we saw the majority of the
weedy fields had a higher seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: density than the clean fields,
which suggests that there's some support
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the farmers picking of each field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting is we found the
presence of red clover in the seed bank in
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found the red clover was present in
22 of the 24 fields over the two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The density ranges from 0 to 4,000
seedlings per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we saw some we saw in
certain farms that red clover had made up
[SPEAKER_00]: a large percentage of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in the Myers farm,
they made up 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, our last conclusion is
that there were common species amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of farms, or all farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those species were giant foxtail,
pigweed species, wood sorrel species,
[SPEAKER_00]: persian speedwell, common lambscorter,
and common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this adds to some research that we've
already seen, where these species have
[SPEAKER_00]: been identified as common species in
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some next steps to take from this
project would be to determine management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that would promote the
persistence of red clover seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this is volunteering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also heard from many farmers that
they're actually already utilizing this
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we start
investigating other methods and ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: managing red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, in the context of this study,
it's important to explore differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in the Myers farm,
we saw high levels of red clover compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just be good to explore the
differences in terms of management to see
[SPEAKER_00]: why they have such higher levels and how
we could use those management practices in
[SPEAKER_00]: other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project would not be possible
without the Sustainable Cropping Systems
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab, led by Matt Ryan, my great friend
Jeff Liebert, Sondre Weyman, Chris Pelzer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, the four farmers that
participate in this project, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: other people who just helped me with the
presentation, editing my thesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as well, just other suggestions and
helpful guiding lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, I presented common names
just because I thought it'd be easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: just the presentation sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it is pretty common to use
scientific names for species that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more annuals than perennials,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, wood sorrel was common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that at all farms, but at very
low levels, about 3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides that, off the top of my head,
I can't think of any that were common
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority were annuals.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so your first question, remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the paper at least that I'm
writing, I didn't present it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have taken soil health data from
each farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we can look at and
analyze further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who don't know, soil health
tests are just comprehensive tests of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological factors, chemical factors,
and physical factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil structure, chemical, pH,
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your second question,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so with nitrogen, it's important to
have a balance because there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that have shown that if you have
excess nitrogen, weeds are way more
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive at taking up that nitrogen
than crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, red clover as a biological
source of nitrogen is fairly good at just
[SPEAKER_00]: staying available for crops, just because
it's not immediately available
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you incorporate it as a green
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just the gist, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a little more complex than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The history of each field is clearly a
factor in what you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you determine the history?
[SPEAKER_02]: How far back do you go to your core of the
field and look at it different times?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you did, can you identify the facts
about the seed morphology?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, that would have a dramatic
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, I think a longer term
study would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only did two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were only to see a certain time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few studies suggest that it takes a
while for seed banks basically to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: to certain management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we don't necessarily see
that long term effect of management
[SPEAKER_00]: because we only have the two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have gone back and we've gone
about seven to four years back of
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices from each farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we didn't present it in this,
but that is something we have been looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
OK.
Thank you, Cody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
