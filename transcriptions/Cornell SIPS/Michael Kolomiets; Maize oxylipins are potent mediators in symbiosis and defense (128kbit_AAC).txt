[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for the kind
introduction and for, most importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: for having me here on this beautiful
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever visit Texas A&M and you would
like to see full colors, you will never
[SPEAKER_00]: see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not now, not later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be all the same gray in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so pretty here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish tomorrow when I fly back to Texas I
will take a picture from the plane for my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife because she misses beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a bit of slides, but the
majority of the slides are simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I will go through them fast,
and they are showing a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, and that's the point of my
presentation today, is to convince you
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is life beyond jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasmonic acid is just one of the exhibits
produced by the plants, and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: produce hundreds of different other
molecular species of oxalipans,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would like to leave you with a
strong conviction that other oxalipans in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have important physiological array
of functions in diverse physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and especially in defense
against pathogens and insects and even
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with beneficial microorganisms
called colonizing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to show this picture
simply because I'm really proud that Texas
[SPEAKER_00]: A &M decided to build a new building for
plant sociology and microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: department, and it's going to be right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab is quite large, simply because we
do a lot of breeding in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will explain to you how that works,
and so these are all graduate students
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and these are, there's another
graduate student, and these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I collaborated with a lot of
different plants, people in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was funded by the National Science
Foundation for maybe 10 years in a row,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that funding came to collaborate with
Nancy Keller at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin-Madison to study oxalipids in
maize, and oxalipids produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal pathogen aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collaborated a lot with Ivo Feustner at
the University of GÃ¶ttingen, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: until I went there in 2010 for sabbatical
leave, and I now am capable of running all
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochemical analysis that Ivo taught
me how to do while in his lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we are doing that in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we do not, I do not
collaborate any longer, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I collaborate with these people,
but I do not need these services any
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to run phytohormone analysis or
volatile organic compounds analysis or
[SPEAKER_00]: other volatiles used by the plants I
started collaboration with a group here,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Rebecca Nelson and Judy Kaufman,
and they are testing Ivo mutants for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to northern congolive blight,
which is a big problem here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern United States, but not a problem
in Texas at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas has its own problem, and that's
aspergillus laevis and mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination by the funders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collaborated with Chuck Hennerly,
he works on trichodermal mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you may know, and the role of
trichodermal mutants trichodermal mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: is a root colonizing endophyte that
induces systemic resistance in the above
[SPEAKER_00]: ground organs, and we just got funded by
USDA to study signaling events between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two organisms, and we have collaborated
with Seth Murray and Tom Isick,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is primarily for field-based testing
for mycotoxin contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, I collaborated with
Betsy and Sandy Pearson, and that's to
[SPEAKER_00]: study the effect of pseudomonas
chloroafis, which also is an endophyte of
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat and corn that induces systemic
resistance and promotes growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I do not have time to talk
about this research today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I will give you a brief overview of
what I do in my lab, and what the idea is
[SPEAKER_00]: behind all of these different projects
that we have in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We primarily work with two gene families,
laboxigenesis, and OXIFY to the enoate in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cases, and these genes are required
for not only just one case by synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the production of other OXO lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will focus primarily on what we
have found so far, in terms of the role
[SPEAKER_00]: that OXO lipids play in mace interactions
with his average ciliotis, it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: fumonacin, and especially slaves,
it produces aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: With showing you the data that suggests
that the epoxigenesis and OXO lipids that
[SPEAKER_00]: are expressed in roots have a strong,
either positive or negative role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with stocodermic variants and
conferring induced systemic resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what are OXO lipids?
[SPEAKER_00]: OXO lipids simply stand for oxygen
oxygenated lipids that are implants
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from two polyunsaturated fatty
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linoleic acid contains two double bonds,
AT2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linoleic acid contains three double bonds,
which is AT3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting products of this primary
oxygenation of fatty acids is production
[SPEAKER_00]: of a vast array of OXO lipids,
and I'll show you the scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis of these my OXO lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are suspected, in addition to just
monocates, they are suspected to possess
[SPEAKER_00]: potent signaling activities, strong
antimicrobial insecticidal activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we know very little about what
these molecules are doing in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they do in animal systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what they do in animal
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an inspiration for my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I show only here, there is several
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will never find a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will show you what OXO lipids do in
mammalian systems simply because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even call them usually OXO lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them by the class of hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, one of these classes of hormones
is called prostaglandins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are six other large groups of
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hypoxins, thromboxanes,
and so on that are produced by mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will only show you an example for
prostaglandins because these molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce from arachidonic acid
that has 20 carbon chain fatty acids that
[SPEAKER_00]: has four double bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a subset of prostaglandins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these letters and numbers indicate
a different molecular species of this
[SPEAKER_00]: prostaglandins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these prostaglandins is
produced specifically in specific cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and transported to by specific cell
transporters and perceived in other
[SPEAKER_00]: different cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a number of different G protein couple
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you think about just one case,
just one case, it has a single receptor in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called CoI1 receptor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, prostaglandins, different molecular
species of prostaglandins in mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: systems have different G protein couple
receptors and different functions that
[SPEAKER_00]: they convey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the list of all the
different physiological processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: prostaglandins regulate, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to regulate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pretty logical process in
mammalian systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspirin is known to all of you because
it's the mode of action of aspirin on us
[SPEAKER_00]: is to prevent biosynthesis of these
oxalates by binding to cyclooxygenases and
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting activity of lipoxygenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result of that is down regulation
of some of these oxalates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I will show you some of the data
showing that when you knock out some
[SPEAKER_00]: lipoxygenase genes in maize and all of a
sudden instead of increased susceptibility
[SPEAKER_00]: to pathogens, they display strong
increased resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you should think of them as,
of that effect, as effect of salicylic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid or aspirin winding to inhibiting
these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sometimes overproduction of these
molecules lead to array of physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this pathway is so well understood in
mammalian system that 60% of the drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: currently available on the United States
market target these pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, not only synthesis but also
transport but also specific process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, my proposal is calculated,
it's a data from the science paper in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2001, he calculated what is current number
of drugs that regulate this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is estimated 85% of FDA-approved
drugs target these pathways in mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's how much we know about them in
mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do we know about plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants produce a bunch of these
obsolescence and they are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily by the lipoxygenase pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what lipoxygenases do is oxidize fatty
acid in two different positions,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine or 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important that you discern
these two types of lipoxygenases because
[SPEAKER_00]: only 13 lipoxygenase is capable of
producing eventually just monocases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine oxalipins cannot take part in
oxalipin, in just monocases by synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce what we call nine oxalipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that reaction seems to be simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only four different products are produced
here by lipoxygenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, the problem is the lipoxygenase
pathway and the complexity comes when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take into account that these primary
products, hydroxyapatite acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: are converted by seven different
subbranches of the log pathway to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: tons of different oxalipins, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this, if I talk to Evo
Feusner, who knows best oxalipin field in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, I ask him one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Evo, how many oxalipins plants produce
collectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he measured them in many different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: He estimated 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he believes it's probably more to
700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year, there is about four to six
reports of non-new oxalipins being
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the best understood oxalipin in
plants, of course, is just monocase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced by the allinoxide synthesis
branch of the pestling and involves
[SPEAKER_00]: oxo-phytidinoid to the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few of them, not all of them,
to make just monocase and eventually just
[SPEAKER_00]: monocasetized solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can measure most of these
oxalipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my lab, we measure about 75 different
oxalipin species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because we purchased this
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not capable of measuring,
unfortunately, all 700 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could, but we only measure what
we can get standards for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my long-term goal of my lab is to
decide the functions of oxalipins in
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever those functions are,
we are after what the specific oxalipins
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing for plant responses to stress,
including abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do it is to generate
transposon insertional mutants in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes of the oxalipin biosynthesis
pestling, if those genes are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in maize, there are 13
lipoxygenase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five allinoxide-synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eight oxo-phytidinoid to the
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two hydroperoxide lasers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in Arabidopsis, these numbers
are about half of that for each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: gene families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the way we generate these mutants is
by taking advantage of that so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: clagicility system for corn available at
Pioneer, because that's where I worked as
[SPEAKER_00]: a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, Pioneer has been, a long time ago,
a couple of dozens of years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: created this huge population of about
48,000 plants in each one of each cell
[SPEAKER_00]: that was produced by crossing a new active
parent with diverse embryo clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that resulted in this large
mutagenized population, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do at Pioneer is to use
gene-specific primers and potato-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: primers in screening pools of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know how many plants are
in that pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they identify plants or pools and
individual plants and individual families
[SPEAKER_00]: that contain insertion of the gene in
your, insertion in your gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it takes about two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Mill is very good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes my lab about seven
back-crosses and about 10 years and two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three generations of graduate students to
produce near-sagenic clients at the
[SPEAKER_00]: back-cross seven stage that are now
apple-to-apple comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, because of how long does it
take to generate these mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We only published half, maybe 5% of the
mutants that we have generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a great time to be in my lab,
because the mutants are generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just come in my lab for graduate
students and do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so my genome contains
satelepopsigenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be grouped roughly into large,
two large subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are satelepopsigenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those genes are required for just
monogasic biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that all these three
genes are producing GLBs, but in different
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk today only about box 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And box 7, 8, and 9 are likely to be
involved in J biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides searching boxes, the main genome
encodes six, nine lipopsigenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of each is very unique to monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it Mux12, and I will show you data
about this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene somehow regulates biosynthesis,
so just monogasic by this lipopsigenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this huge potential for crosstalk
between the nine boxes versus searching
[SPEAKER_00]: box pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is unusual lipopsigenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even use fatty acid as a
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses hydroperoxide of fatty acid,
which is produced by another
[SPEAKER_00]: lipopsigenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it cleaves all fatty
acid into unusual fragments, C13 and C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, C5, many of you may not
have heard of pentanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this log-size of one is likely to be
involved specifically in biosynthesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: this volatile pentanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, today I will, so we generated mutants
for all of them, but one, for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, we tried many times to identify
mutator insertion in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It calls Green Harbor and Pioneer,
then Pioneer again, and we always fail to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify insertion of any mutator in LOX11
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's only one left for us to go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk today about the genotypes and
the function of exam LOX3, LOX5,
[SPEAKER_00]: and LOX10, and LOX12.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you want to know about any
other lipopsigenase, I can talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, like LOX2 and 1,
are involved in salt stress tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: drug intolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOX4 appear to be required for defense
against entrogensly-implied and stalkerot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will not mention about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOX5, sharing 90% identity to LOX4,
has complete opposite function in
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance against insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when you knock out that gene,
these plants are more resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: polytrot, and LOX10 is involved in green
leafy volatile biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, somehow insertion of mutator elements
results in unstable RNA that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we rarely see any transcript using
northern blot or RNA signal if insertions
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to be in exomes of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me tell you what we have found so
far about the function of lipopsigenases
[SPEAKER_00]: in mace interactions with Fusarium
reticuloides and Aspergillus slavus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Aspergillus slavus produces a potent
carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, aflatoxin is number one,
the most potent carcinogen produced by,
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, by microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's the most potent carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it causes cancer development in liver,
it's a mutagen, and it also causes
[SPEAKER_00]: immunosuppression in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Fusarium reticuloides produces another
mycotoxin called fumonacin, and fumonacin
[SPEAKER_00]: induces program cell death, inhibits the
sphingolipid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's how program cell death is
induced by fumonacin by binding to
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramide synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fumonacin takes and preventing
sphingolipid synthesis and accumulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors of sphingolipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the idea about lipopsigenases having
any something to do with the regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxin production came from Nancy
Keller's research where she showed when
[SPEAKER_00]: she disrupts an oxalipin biosynthesis
genes in Aspergillus, they're called
[SPEAKER_00]: Xifact of producing oxyopsigenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are named by Nancy as PPOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipoxigenases are also producing,
there is one lipoxigenase in Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: slavus that produces other subset of
oxalipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Xifactors, when you note them
out, they were shown to either inhibit or
[SPEAKER_00]: promote spherogenesis depending on what
spores are regulated, sexual or asexual,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are potent regulators like
regulators mycotoxin-based synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you shut down basis, the
Xifactors might be a stoichiometric system
[SPEAKER_00]: in Aspergillus nidulans or apotoxin is
inhibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were also shown to be involved in
corum-sensing fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you look at the chemical structure
of plant derived and fungal derived
[SPEAKER_00]: oxalipins, you can clearly see the
resemblance, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that suggests that there is
potentially a lipid-mediated crustal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the oxalipins produced by the fungal
species can be perceived by the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: modulate lipid metabolism in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant derived oxalipins may affect the
physiological processes of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have published a review paper in 2011,
which is kind of, it's very complex to
[SPEAKER_00]: show the schemes from the review paper
because it's been really heavy on detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me tell you what we found so far
towards testing the hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxalipins produced by the plant may,
in fact, have two different effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either induce mycotoxin synthesis by the
fungus or suppress mycotoxin synthesis by
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in this particular case, when we knock
out LOX3, what we have seen right away
[SPEAKER_00]: when we screened the seed, the production
of oxalipins in the seed, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: nine HOTs produced from Linolenic acid and
nine KUGs were reduced and nine HOT,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an oxalipin derivative from Linolenic
acid is completely gone in this LOX3-4
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so they are nine oxalipin
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, LOX3 is not involved in dysphonic acid
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nine lipoxygenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we tested how the fungi grow on
the seed, we found no difference
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fungi don't care in terms of
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about the presence of LOX3
gene in the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a big surprise came when we measured
few months in B1 synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, the mutant, when fungus
is grown on LOX3 mutant, they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: about 200-fold last mycotoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they suggest that LOX3 is required
for induction of mycotoxin-based
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not even know even now how it works,
but that is a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the LOX3 function is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, without LOX3 in the host,
the Fusarium reticulitis produces a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for that reason, we place LOX3 at
specifically regulating secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism and mycotoxin synthesis and
positively regulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for genesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it appears to have no role in
vegetative growth of the fungus on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we tested what it is in LOX3
mutants that may be responsible for such
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on fumonocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have ran microarray analysis long
time ago with Darren Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen that many other
lipoxygenase such as LOX6, LOX9,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 11, and OPR7, 8, these two are
involved in J-biosynthesis, are all
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpressed in this LOX3 seed,
colonized by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have tested independently some of
the genes for which you generated mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should read what we saw that LOX3
also overexpressed LOX10 and LOX5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That suggests that LOX3, somehow,
9 oxalibins produced by LOX3, suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of these other lipoxygenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you about the phenotypes
of these mutants in response to Fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: and Aspergillus labens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on, we will come back to the
same gene to show you how overexpression
[SPEAKER_00]: of these two genes in the roots impact
interaction with strechoderma as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we tested LOX5 mutants,
remember LOX3 mutants are colonized
[SPEAKER_00]: equally well when drawn on either the wild
type or the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use LOX5, it's clear that LOX5
mutant seed is much more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium and Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably corresponding to the
increased biomass given LOX5 mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see also increased number of carnidia
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was shocking to discover that it
had no effect whatsoever on femonocyn
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that placed LOX5 as regulating
vegetative growth and probably due to
[SPEAKER_00]: increased vegetative growth, increased
carnidiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, LOX5 has specific effect, productive
LOX5 has specific effect on the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOX10 mutants became, in contrast to LOX3
mutants, LOX10 mutants are heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: colonized by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it's femonocyn that was
increased, that probably corresponds well
[SPEAKER_00]: to increased fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carnidia was also increased but not as
strongly as femonocyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, suggestions in LOX10 has more specific
effect on femonocyn synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike LOX5 because the phenotypes of LOX5
mutants in turn, in terms of colonization
[SPEAKER_00]: are same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that places LOX10 together with LOX5
as controlling vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LOX10 potentially has more stronger
effect on inducing mycotoxin synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this different lipocytogenesis that we
have just finished generating,
[SPEAKER_00]: just published a long couple of years ago,
we have found that LOX12, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: another non-lipoxygenase, monocot-specific
lipoxygenase, no dicode to contain this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, it has a very specific effect on
defense against psilurias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just monic acid regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me show what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, LOX12 is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not a switching block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could not be involved in
J-biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, LOX12 mutants, similarly to 5 and 10,
is also heavily colonized by fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, fusarium produces a lot
more of both spores and femonocyn B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably what the function of LOX12
derived oxalate bands is to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how does LOX12 do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early papers, we were not able to measure
oxalate bands of our cells and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we had to send the samples to Germany
to be analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can do that analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we did a lot greater analysis of
oxalate bands produced by this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in addition to seed, LOX12 mutants
are a lot more susceptible in mesocotyls
[SPEAKER_00]: to fusarium colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when we measured oxalate bands,
we found that several of the nine oxalate
[SPEAKER_00]: bands, even some certain oxalate bands,
like this certain KG, not statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant though, but nine KG is
specifically reduced in the LOX12 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting that this molecule may be the
one involved in resistance, in providing
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance against fusarium-rich
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we tested just one case of
disillusioned levels, what we have found
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the wild tab, seed inoculated by
fusarium, just one case is increased
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not in LOX12 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, somehow it is nine LOX, and
potentially nine KG, regulates just one
[SPEAKER_00]: case by synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the question was then, so we submitted
a paper just like that, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the reviewers say, well,
since you have republished just
[SPEAKER_00]: J-deficient mutants, OPR7A double mutants,
why not test the role of dysphonic acid in
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to fusarium-rich cellulose,
which was a very valid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except, the LOX12 mutants are so
susceptible to fusarium-rich cellulose,
[SPEAKER_00]: that every time we plant it in the field,
it doesn't germinate well, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: succumbs to fusarium and potentially other
soil-borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it took us one year to fight with this
mutant, to grow it in such a way that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have any fusarium-pre-colonized
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but we were able to do it,
and we tested J-deficient mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, by the way, they also,
I will show you this data, they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive under severe conditions
due to extreme susceptibility to basing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we tested is this OPR7A double
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to knock out both of these genes
in order to get rid of your activity that
[SPEAKER_00]: is required for converting CISA-PDA,
the natural substrate for J-bisynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: into dysmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other OPRs, there are six of them in
the image, we do not know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, we do not know what they produce,
because they use CISA-PDA as a substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and convert it into some yet
unidentifying, unknown, potential
[SPEAKER_00]: obsulipin synthesis, and detoxification of
alpha-beta-unsaturated carbonates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we tested those mutants for
resistance against fusarium, it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we infected the plants before we left
work at about six or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come in the morning at eight o'clock,
and they already macerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, they just completely
collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that suggests that dysmonic acid is
clearly required for defense against
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium reticulitis, no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess that potentially, people who
work with fusarium reticulitis and
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus larvae still argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not confident what the lifestyles
of these two pathogens are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we still argue whether they are
necrotrophs, hemibiotrophs, or not
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely biotrophs, but we do not know
if they're hemibiotrophs or necrotrophs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it suggests, because of requirement of
J for defense against these pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: that fusarium reticulitis is likely to be
either a necrotroph or at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemibiotroph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, OPR7A double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took my postdoc to generate his double
mutants for about two years because he
[SPEAKER_00]: would plant a large field of segregating 1
in 16 population, and none of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that he genotyped were double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of coming and talking to me,
he says I failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, next year, he plants, instead of 200
individuals, he plants 5,000 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He screens them all, and none of them are
double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I talk to him, which is like,
you cannot fail two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, well, I don't know what happened,
but there is no double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, you were supposed to think
what that might mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, what that means is that these
plants, they are aliso, so they die for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, you can only,
yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damping off or dumping off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dumping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dumping off seems appropriate,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we did identify that the culprit
in this case was pythium aristosporum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we saw in Texas fields all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or commercial soils also have pythium,
and so it dies really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you germinate the plants in sterile
soil and then transplant them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, like this, and I don't even know
why he did that work, because I know they
[SPEAKER_00]: died from pythium, but he wanted to see
how fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, OK, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look how fast they sprung to the
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes only about 10 days to kill 100%
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're extremely susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was really surprising,
when you started testing for resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: against aspergillus leaves and aspergillus
tops, because that's what Texas farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about fusariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our problem is aflatoxin, and that's when
I lost funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because log-3 mutant, that was
characterized by extremely low level of
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination by fumonacin, are extremely
susceptible to aspergillus leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it in the kernel acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that they produce all this at a
much greater level of aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fumonacin down, aflatoxin is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colonization by fusarium is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flava is just low this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested them with these other loxas
that are all expressed in log-3 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, we saw the exact
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in contrast, log-3 mutants,
log-5 mutants were contaminated by
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin, about five-fold less in every
genetic background that we have tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked the breeders' use for
resistance to aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really amazing effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested log-10, and it was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2006 and 2007, we have every year we test
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still been published because I don't
understand how it works, because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we showed that log-10 mutants are
barely colonized by aspergillus leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever aspergillus, in fact,
produces very little aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two genes appear to be helping
the pathogen to colonize, helping the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen to produce more aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of log-5, I still cannot
pinpoint what exactly it produces,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of what oxalipin it produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do know for sure that log-10 is
the sole lipoxygenase in the meshenome
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for green leafy volatile
glycemic synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you wound a leaf of wild type,
you see a spike in the emission of these
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hexanol, this is the hexanol,
hexanol acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them grow up, but you cannot
identify any traces of these volatiles in
[SPEAKER_00]: log-10 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting log-10 is the only gene
required for GLB.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder now whether GLB have anything to
do with making plants susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And contamination is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me switch gears and tell you what
we have found for some of these mutants in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their interaction with these
beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can publish a paper before this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invited to publish a paper on
long-distance signaling route to shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, okay, it's some projects that
died long time ago in 2007, and I never
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out why log-3 mutants are more
resistant to anthracnose leaf blight,
[SPEAKER_00]: salvin corn leaf blight, and I will show
you this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you plant log-3 mutants in the
field, they have always shown the same
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more resistant to salvin corn
leaf blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are more resistant to anthracnose
leaf blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are more resistant to anthracnose
stock rot or fusarium stock rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really surprising,
that when we tested, the expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes in response to fungal
infection of the leaves, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the colitorial communicables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is true for global
heterostrophes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene is not induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how long you measure
expression of this gene after infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene is not expressed in the place
where it has effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are resistant to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would suspect that at least it has
to be expressed somehow during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a gene that is expressed in
leaves, period, where it's expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pointed to as potential significance
of root expression of these genes on what
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening in the above ground organs in
terms of resistance, increased resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hypothesis then was that log-3
mutants produce some signal in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are transported from the roots into
the leaves and stocks and induce increased
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you work with dipods,
you know what to do in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get log-3 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would do the crafting experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, for those of you who work
with monocots, it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we had to come up with a new
method how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A craft-like experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one time, my brother was cutting these
plants because he was done with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he looked at them, oh my god,
they produce so much xylem sap that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can collect milliliters of it within a
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, wow, that could be a way
for me to know if there is any signal
[SPEAKER_00]: present in xylem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how to apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make the tiny incisions,
one centimeter away from each other on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apply twice diluted xylem sap,
only 10 microliters, six hours before
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, in fact, we used it in
Coletotocum graminicola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you collect xylem sap from wild
type and apply it to plants, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: normally infected by Coletotocum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normal vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you take the same plant,
the same genotype, and after application,
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem sap collected from Phlox 3 mutants,
these plants were much more resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: Coletotocum infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supporting the idea that the roots of
Phlox 3 produce constitutively some
[SPEAKER_00]: signal, and you can collect it,
and you can measure it, and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the wilder plants, and you see this
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that also suggested that potentially,
this gene is regulated by trichodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance to colonize these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, when you get rid of Phlox 3,
the plants are more resistant in
[SPEAKER_00]: background organs, but Phlox 3 is not
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's expressed in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phlox 3 is a negative regulator of ISR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, then trichoderma may or may not
have effect on this gene or the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we treated, trichoderma means roots of
wild type, or Phlox 3 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in wild type, what you see,
trichoderma induces systemic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lesions are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in trichoderma, oh, I'm sorry,
you compared it to wild type here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichoderma induces increased resistance.
In Phlox 3 mutants, they're already
resistant.
Doesn't matter how much trichoderma they
have on the roots, they're already
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then hypothesis was that in order for
trichoderma to have an ISR-inducing
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, it must suppress Phlox 3
expression in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, it's easy to propose this
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like now, when my students were
doing this experiment, I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, what if it's not going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never be able to submit this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was shocked how beautiful it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, and what we did, we used Delta
SM1 mutant of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without this small peptide, it's a secret
peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you knock out that gene for SM1,
these plants are not able to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic resistance in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you overexpress, the leaves were
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this SM1 protein is required for
inducing systemic resistance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used this mutant and compared it to
the effect of this mutation versus wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type on expression of Phlox 3 in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw, that wild type indeed,
like I really hoped it would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In wild type trichoderma, in fact,
roots, Phlox 3 expression is repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Phlox 3 cannot be repressed when
you use this ISR-deficient mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that places Phlox 3 as one of the
targets for SM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: One function of SM1, fungal protein,
and fungal protein is to suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of Phlox 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question was, what it is in Phlox
3 that makes it so crazy that it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: this ISR signal all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have tested the expression of all
the lipoxygenases for which we have
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants or some other genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at nine lipoxygenase
expression in the roots compared to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type, there is 24 induction overexpression
of Phlox 4 in the Phlox 3 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phlox 5 was overexpressed, Phlox 12 was
overexpressed, and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this ACC seriesase or OPR8,
for example, 22-fold, 24-fold,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-fold, allenoxide cyclase, 48-fold
overexpression in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots of Phlox 3 overexpressed a
whole bunch of this other oxalibin
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis and ethylene biosynthesis
genes, which suggests that just one
[SPEAKER_00]: occasion, nine oxalibins and ethylene may
be the reason why these mutants are more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to foliar pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that signal is produced in the Phlox 3
mutant's constituent rather than in the
[SPEAKER_00]: inducible manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested Phlox 10 just because we knew
exactly what it is doing in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required for GLB biosynthesis,
but also because we found something really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique about Phlox 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a project to localize some cellular
variables, and it is in the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we produced transgenic plants with the
help of Dave Jackson from Goldsmith
[SPEAKER_00]: Harbor, and they produce transgenic plants
that express YFP tag-Lox 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked everywhere where Lox 10 is
and found that Lox 10 is found in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that it's found in chloroplasts,
and they also identified some other
[SPEAKER_00]: organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still do not know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was really surprising to see is
that Lox 10 seems to stream in both phloem
[SPEAKER_00]: and xylem because it moves in opposite
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lox 10 directly as a protein secreted
into a phloem and xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made Lox 10 a perfect candidate to
be relevant to long-distance signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we tested Lox 10 mutants for ISR
in response to trachodermal colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you infect and you have wildlife,
you simply see in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without trachoderma, they are normally
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of trachoderma to the roots
makes it more resistant to colitotrophic
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lox 10 mutants are very surprising because
GLBs are believed to be required for
[SPEAKER_00]: defense against pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, these mutants were more resistant
not only in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lox 10 mutants were resistant in the stem,
to endocrine-leaf blight, to fusariums,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were resistant to everything we
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But immediately after you treat Lox 10
mutants with trachoderma, these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: become all of a sudden completely
susceptible to colitotrophic infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only they have lost induced systemic
resistance, they gain some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it induced systemic susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, these plants are
resistant without trachoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are a lot more susceptible
than trachoderma is their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's suggest that Lox 10 is relevant
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested other mutants in that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least we found exactly the same
phenotype for Lox 12 mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lox 12 mutants are normally,
there is no change in resistance levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when plant is colonized with
trachoderma, they become a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now, we were funded by USDA to
identify these long-distance signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are utilizing the xylin set that we
can collect massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are profiling oxalipins, hormones,
and other metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already have several candidates
that needs to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those candidates, by the way,
are not dysmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally against the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because dysmonic acid is believed to be
required for ISR in diethylic species,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in man's.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we used OPR7, 8-G diffusion mutants,
they are still capable of responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: trachodermal colonization by increased
resistance in the stem and in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So J is not the long-distance signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some other oxalipins produced by
neither oxigenases or precursors of J that
[SPEAKER_00]: are required for induced systemic
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to invite your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
