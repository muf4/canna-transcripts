[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Nina just demonstrated, soils are
composed of different percentages of
[SPEAKER_01]: different sized particles, sand,
silt, and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a technique we can demonstrate now
that will give us an approximation of
[SPEAKER_01]: those representative percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those percentages are indicated on the
USDA texture triangle, which we also have
[SPEAKER_01]: with us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this technique that's going to give us
an approximation of the percentages is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give us an indication of the soil
texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by running through this flow chart
here, we're going to end up with a sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: rough estimation of the texture of these
two samples of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two samples here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to start with this one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just going to run through the
process on our flow chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts with taking a small amount of
soil in the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is soil texture by feel or by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to sort the soil a little
bit, removing sticks and stones,
[SPEAKER_01]: elements larger than the largest particle,
sand, that do not form part of the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: textural composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just pulling out the stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are just large particles of
soil that are kind of glued together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to remove those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to get down here to just
the basic composition of soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just kind of sieving them out,
filtering them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last piece is a gravel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I have what is pretty much just the
soil, the soil left, these are just field
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, just dug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wet the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to place just a couple of drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal here is to form a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get a ball of soil that's
roughly putty-like in consistency,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that kind of holds together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to keep wetting until
we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just add a little more soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want about a little golf ball size so
we have enough to run our diagnostic on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of mixing it in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going for here is we want the
soil to form a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first part of the test,
if it will form a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're just about there when your
hands are covered in dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now reading through our flow chart,
the first questions it will ask is will
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample form a ball when squeezed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give it a little squeeze,
and it retains its shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it then wants to just kind of shatter
and fall apart following through the
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnostic, we end up with that your
sample is sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not just sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the next part of this test is to
try to form a ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ability of the soil sample to form
a ribbon and hold it is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: measure of the percentage of clay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to form a ribbon, you can take the
sample in the palm of your hand like this
[SPEAKER_01]: and you start to kind of squeeze and feed
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want it to break naturally and
fall, okay, to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do that a couple of times and each
time estimating the length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have about three quarters of an
inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it back into a ball form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dry it out a little bit in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed it a little more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want water to be squeezed out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going back to forming a ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squeezing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this time we hit about an inch.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just do one more ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll take the average of the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shattered when it hit, but just
under an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now following through our flow chart
here, diagram, I'm reading, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a ball and the ribbon formation,
we had an inch or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the loam category.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part of the test is to
estimate the percentage of grit or sand in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take a little bit of it,
put the rest aside, about a teaspoon or
[SPEAKER_01]: two here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to wet it in the palm of my
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this process is intended to kind of
flatten it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Estimate the percentage of sand as a
factor of how gritty the soil sample
[SPEAKER_01]: feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diagram asks us, does the sample
feel very gritty, equally gritty and
[SPEAKER_01]: smooth, or very smooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of just got to give an estimation
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhat gritty and somewhat smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of feels somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diagnostic has led us to the
conclusion then that this sample is a
[SPEAKER_01]: loam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to listen to the sample and
see if I can hear the sound of the grit
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can hear it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere between a loam and a sandy
loam then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we turn to the texture triangle,
we can actually then convert that
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosis into percentages of the various
particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reading here, we have a sandy loam
being composed of something around 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: clay max and somewhere between 70 to 50%
sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a loam being as low as 30% sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably somewhere down in that
30% to 40% range, below sandy loam.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try the next sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: By appearance alone, there's not really
much we can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to visually distinguish
these two soils in terms of their texture
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by running through the soil texture by
feel, we should be able to make some
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure we get all the last sample
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're going to sort the sample
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving some roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we have a sufficient quantity
there to get our ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wetting the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not quite consolidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's starting to form a little film on
my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to oversaturate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to our flow chart, the first
diagnostic is to see if the sample will
[SPEAKER_01]: form a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have a nice ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and under a little pressure,
from the finger, it doesn't fall apart,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know we don't have a sand sample,
as we suspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still stays together, stays put.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a sand or a loamy sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to move down into the next
step, which is the ribbon forming process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get teed up in my hand, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And start feeding it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right away I can tell that it's
forming a longer ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one broke when it hit, but there we
have maybe an inch and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run that three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to let it naturally
just feed over my forefinger until it
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to fall.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be almost two inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one last sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe an inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about an inch and a half average.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reading across, we've gotten into the
clay loam category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we need to estimate the amount of
grit in the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take a small portion of it
in the palm of my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And re-wet it in order to form a film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get a sense of the percentage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recalling that this relates back to the
percentages of the various particles in
[SPEAKER_01]: the texture triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already I can tell there's some grit
there, certainly, but I'm not feeling as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as the previous sample at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of sound of friction,
but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly less than half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're more on the smooth side with this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere between clay loam and a silty
clay loam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going over here to the texture triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a clay loam here and a silty clay
loam here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell then that we're somewhere
between 30 to 40% clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't move much, but it definitely,
we didn't move the percentage of clay very
[SPEAKER_01]: far, but it definitely changed the
characteristic qualities of the texture of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it became more smooth, more capable of
forming a longer ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: With just a little bit more clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changed the, just that small amount
of adjustment changed the soil texture for
[SPEAKER_00]: us in our diagnostic.
