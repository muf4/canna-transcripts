[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal today is to share a few things
with you to get you thinking about your
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that some of you are faculty
and are currently in teaching roles,
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of you are graduate students and
probably will be in teaching roles at some
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope to get you thinking about some
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably not going to go as deep as
some of you might like to think,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I can certainly recommend some
resources if you want to look at some of
[SPEAKER_06]: these topics at a little bit deeper level.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do plan to have some interactivity built
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so hopefully you came prepared with
the mindset of at least being open to some
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion and some questioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we'll see where that leads.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first I want to pose a question to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to do a think pair share.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that if I understand from
Travis that you guys learned about some of
[SPEAKER_06]: these active learning strategies a little
while ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll pose the question to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you think about it for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can pair up with someone
around you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll have a few of you share
some of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, in your classes,
what does it look like when students are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so let's go ahead and pair up and
share what you think with someone around
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, let's rejoin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's come back together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what were some of the things that
you guys were discussing?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it look like when students are
getting it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have a few volunteers?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so the students are volunteering.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're asking their own questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell it because they're really
engaged.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, what else?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, OK, I get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're kind of reading their body
language and the psychological signs that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're giving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I won't ask this question,
but you can probably do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably as you were thinking about that,
we're also thinking, what's it look like
[SPEAKER_06]: when they're not getting it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully today, I'm going to give
you some things to think about so that we
[SPEAKER_06]: can really generate this more in your
classes, as opposed to the frustrating
[SPEAKER_06]: times when students aren't getting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to frame my discussion this
morning around five principles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a few handouts out and
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can feel free to jot down a few
extra things if you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: But five principles that I think will help
you create meaningful learning experiences
[SPEAKER_06]: in your classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my objectives for today are we're going
to describe the principles of experiential
[SPEAKER_06]: learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then ultimately, I'm going to
encourage you guys at the end to think
[SPEAKER_06]: about your own teaching, whether it's your
teaching now or whether you will have a
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching role in the future, about what
are some things that you can do in your
[SPEAKER_06]: own teaching to make it more meaningful
for your students.
[SPEAKER_06]: So principle one, learning begins with the
existing knowledge and experiences of the
[SPEAKER_06]: learner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning begins with the existing
knowledges and experiences of the learner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll let you read this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is this what we think about our
students?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just a brain on a stick and
nothing else matters?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really, it's this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what makes us uniquely human are
those individual experiences and
[SPEAKER_06]: aspirations and goals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would contend that one of the
things we ought to be doing as instructors
[SPEAKER_06]: is getting to know this student.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we still want to care about this
one, at least this part of this one,
[SPEAKER_06]: but getting to know this student so we
know who are our students.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do they want to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they want to be?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they already know?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the experiences they have?
[SPEAKER_06]: Second thing I want to bring up is there
is no such thing as a blank slate.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as a blank slate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether or no matter what you're
teaching, your students are coming to you
[SPEAKER_06]: with some level of understanding or
perhaps misunderstanding of the concepts
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're trying to teach.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no blank slate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if we go into the learning
environment thinking that there's a blank
[SPEAKER_06]: slate, we're starting at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really about trying to figure out
what is on their slate and building off of
[SPEAKER_06]: that as opposed to starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So principle number one, learning begins
with the existing knowledge and
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences of the learner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let me pose a question to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So based on principle number one,
what are some things you might think about
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to do in your classes to capture
principle number one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do some sort of an assessment,
whether it's formal or informal,
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of gather what these students
know.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more idea that you might do in your
classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so have them try to connect with the
new stuff you're giving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have them try to connect with what they
already know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will help you do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do an activity with some of my classes
called a concept map.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of you guys familiar with the concept
map?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a way to organize thoughts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so actually the graduate course I
teach on experiential learning,
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this very activity at the very
beginning of the semester.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have them create their concept map about
how people learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end of the semester,
I have them recreate that concept map.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I give them back the first one
that they did so they can see the growth
[SPEAKER_06]: in their own understanding of how people
learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all about what they know and what
they bring to the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are no blank slates.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was principle number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Principle number two, learning is a
cyclical process.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cyclical process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to walk you through a series
of little videos to kind of help us think
[SPEAKER_06]: about maybe a learning cycle that we might
share in common that we have been through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll pose this question to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you learn to ride a bike?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want you to think about that for
a sec and kind of recreate some memories
[SPEAKER_06]: or pull some memories out of the file
storage to think about what it was like
[SPEAKER_06]: when you learned to ride a bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got a series of short video
clips that I think might demonstrate what
[SPEAKER_06]: some of us have experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I would propose that step one for
many of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me ask before I give you what I
thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you guys what you think.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was step one for you guys in
learning how to ride a bike?
[SPEAKER_06]: No recollection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Creating the wheel in some people's faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that would be a precursor because
the wheel is a critical component of a
[SPEAKER_06]: bicycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other thoughts?
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting that first bike that you really
wanted to ride?
[SPEAKER_06]: Other memories?
[SPEAKER_06]: So seeing other people ride bikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other ideas?
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad holding the back of his seat.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I think many of us have similar
memories to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so all great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to see most of those
things, maybe with the exception of
[SPEAKER_06]: creating the wheel, in these video clips
that I'm going to show you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let me start with this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've got this where it's
going to work out, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're helping.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I would propose that that might
have been step one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might have been when we got that
first tricycle, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we probably did see someone ride the
bike before we got to this stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe this is step two, really,
other than step one.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what are some things that we probably
had to learn about riding a bike when we
[SPEAKER_06]: were at this stage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Coordination, OK, Travis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the pedal, it's a little bit
different motion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not walking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit different motion,
OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else might we have learned at this
stage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little bit of balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the tricycle has a little bit more
balance than a two-wheel bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, you can't lean way over or way
back because you'll fall off, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: What about stopping on the tricycle?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you stop on a tricycle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Either, yeah, you pedal reverse or just
stop pedaling or you stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put your feet down, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would propose that might be step one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I'll bring you to step two.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so step two is when we got that new
bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a two-wheel bike, but it had
training wheels on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what are some things that we
probably had to learn when we were at step
[SPEAKER_06]: two?
Steering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, steering's a little bit different on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the tricycle, the pedals are on the
front wheel, whereas the pedals are back
[SPEAKER_06]: further on those bikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do we have to learn at step two?
The brakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The brakes, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of brakes do those kind of
bikes have?
Pedal brakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You push back on the pedal, and when you
get good, you can leave the skid marks on
[SPEAKER_06]: the driveway.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, what else do we have to learn at that
stage?
[SPEAKER_06]: How to get on the bike because it's a lot
bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: How to get on, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one more thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This side of the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: This side of the room hasn't been as cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so you might get a little bit more
freedom, particularly as you get a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit older.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom or dad or whoever lets you get a
little bit more freedom, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: So our travel through the Bicycle Riding
Academy is continuing.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so step three was the day that the
training wheels came off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, when I ask that question,
that's usually where the people go,
[SPEAKER_06]: is your mom or dad holding onto the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do we have to learn the day that
the training wheels came off?
[SPEAKER_13]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Balance, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And balance is really critical when you
don't have the training wheels.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, what else do we have to learn at that
stage?
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to maintain a certain speed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to maintain a certain speed
because even if you've got, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a few people that can balance
standing still, but I'm not one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you've got to maintain some
level of speed, or you fall over.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do we have to learn at that one?
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_13]: Tipping over doesn't mean you're not going
to get off the bike, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because most of us were there,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of us tipped over a time or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we had some trust issues
with mom or dad hanging onto the back
[SPEAKER_06]: because those of you with children
probably went through this with your own
[SPEAKER_06]: children.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they make you promise to not let go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_06]: We let go every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I promise, I won't let go this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we let go again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working through that cycle,
and we're getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I say we move on to step four.
[SPEAKER_06]: So step four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Step four, we were a little bit braver,
and those boundaries are a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: further out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do we have to lose?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we have to learn at step four?
Wear a helmet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Safety, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wear a helmet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably getting faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look out for our surroundings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look out for our surroundings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably getting faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably getting a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mom or dad probably gave us a little
bit more room to stretch out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You let us take a few more risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, sometimes with the risk comes
those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so after we run into our friend and we
get up and we get a bandaid on our elbow
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever else, then we get back on the
bike and we learn to, well, next time
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe we need to look out where we're
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now let's see what's on step five.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens at step five?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that one was staged, because I have
not found a great video for this yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But step five is when we got that first
bigger bike, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did the bigger bikes have that
the smaller bikes don't have?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everyone's at handlebar brakes,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did we learn is a critical piece
of information related to handlebar
[SPEAKER_06]: brakes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Apply both at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're only going to apply one,
which one do you apply?
[SPEAKER_06]: The rear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what happens if you apply only the
front?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and how did we learn that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Either intentionally or unintentionally,
we did something like that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We flipped off and we said, ah,
oh, OK, I better not do that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just work on the back brakes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could tell that kid had practiced a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I would contend that our journey
through bike riding is still growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, a lot of wind noise on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was just a person riding a bike on
a leisurely thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, how many of you would say that even
if you haven't been on a bike in a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of years, you could probably handle that
today, at least on level ground,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe not on some of the hills you guys
have around here, but on level ground?
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of us would say we can do that
with reasonable thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've reached that level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I don't know about this campus,
our campus, the bicyclists are crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You about have to chase them around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a professor when I was an undergrad
who used to carry a golf club.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was infamous for carrying this golf
club around campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And any time somebody got close to me,
start swinging this golf club,
[SPEAKER_06]: because he wanted the bikes to stay away
from him, because they will zoom up right
[SPEAKER_06]: behind him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of us probably have skill level
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could, with a moderate amount of
success, get on a bike and travel across
[SPEAKER_06]: campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is that the pinnacle of bike riding
skill?
[SPEAKER_06]: I see some heads shaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what might be a next level of bike
riding skill?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some examples?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or riding up the hill, yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, clip-in pedals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too scared to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys seen those where your feet
actually attach to the pedal, and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a trick to get your foot out?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: What other kinds of bike riding might be
the next level?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the jumps and the ramps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the guys that do the racing and
such.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody here do BMX racing, or the
mountain biking, or the Tour de France
[SPEAKER_06]: sorts of stuff racing?
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so there is a level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this next one, I found this video
by a kid named Spencer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want you to look at some of the
stuff that Spencer can do and think about
[SPEAKER_06]: how he got to that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have any Spencer's in here?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as a kid, I probably accidentally
did some of those moves, flipping off or
[SPEAKER_06]: doing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always look back at my brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got two brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's amazing that none of us have
brain damage, considering the stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: we did as kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how do you think Spencer got to the
point where he's at?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it just happened overnight?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he had a lot of practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think every one of his flips,
he worked perfect the first time?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he probably had a lot of bumps,
a lot of bruises.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd try to do a flip, and he'd land on
his head or his butt or his back or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he figured, OK, what do I need to do
different?
[SPEAKER_06]: He kept practicing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was working through and trying to
learn each time he tried something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I propose that one more step in our
bicycle academy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously, that's where we started.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why are we back at that point now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we back at that stage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it kind of we're going to be old and
have to get back on our tricycle one day?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, how to teach someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now, when we're back at that stage,
we're not the little guy with the helmet
[SPEAKER_06]: on the tricycle, we're the parent behind
the tricycle trying to teach our child to
[SPEAKER_06]: do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I've tried to demonstrate with
those videos and getting you guys to think
[SPEAKER_06]: back to your own experiences, say I was
trying to connect to your experiences with
[SPEAKER_06]: riding a bike, to think about how you went
through that process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we went all the way to where
Spencer is, that might be a 10 or 12 year
[SPEAKER_06]: development cycle in terms of bike riding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so learning is a process that we go
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: That we might call the learning cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish I could have a good way to
demonstrate this three dimensionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best way I can describe it is a
slinky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys know what a slinky looks like?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so think of this as a slinky with
multiple revolutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so somewhere in our being,
we've had a very initial focus with the
[SPEAKER_06]: concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll stick with our bicycle example
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we have an experience with that
bicycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got that first tricycle and we had to
learn about balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we leaned too far and we fell off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well down here in the reflection phase,
we think about what can I do differently?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does this hurt?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we think, OK, well next time maybe I
shouldn't lean quite so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we try it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we keep going through this cycle over
and over and over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we get that bike with handlebar
brakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we hit the front brake and we flip
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we're laying on the ground,
we reflect and say, dang, that hurts.
[SPEAKER_06]: What don't I want to do again?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I won't hit the front brake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me try that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's just a constant ongoing
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thinking now to your own current
and future practices in your own teaching,
[SPEAKER_06]: what can you take away from about the
learning cycle relative to how you create
[SPEAKER_06]: learning experiences for your students?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some things you can take away to
help you with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so it's not always going to go
successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can learn from the unsuccessful
attempts at things.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Breaking it down into steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, break it down into steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's an excellent thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes we forget that we all have
advanced degrees in our respective areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many times the students that we're working
with, especially the undergrads and even
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the grad students, they don't have
near the frame of reference that we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Travis?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, a note of remembering the
pieces of the puzzle that we had
[SPEAKER_11]: forgotten, the little mistakes we made in
learning about.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just kind of forget that we knew that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't slow down and teach that to our
students.
[SPEAKER_11]: They won't learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would contend, and this comes from
my own personal experiences and as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: in the work that I do at the University of
Florida, I get the opportunity to do a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of peer observation of other faculty all
over the college.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of my observations is that as
faculty and as instructors, we can get to
[SPEAKER_06]: be pretty good at providing a lot of
creative experiences for our students.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we can come up with lots of cool
experiences for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we invest a lot of effort up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we probably don't place near enough
emphasis down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we might create a very cool experience
in the greenhouse where the students are
[SPEAKER_06]: growing out a crop of whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll talk to them about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then we don't help them reflect and
generalize based on that experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just jump right to the next experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of your students are probably
fairly self-reflective and are themselves
[SPEAKER_06]: hitting these steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would contend that some of your
students probably, they're just sticking
[SPEAKER_06]: up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really learning from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're jumping to the next
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would suggest that one thing you
could do is intentionally design
[SPEAKER_06]: activities to help your students reflect
about what you're doing, figure out what
[SPEAKER_06]: the next step is, and work through the
learning cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So principle two, learning is a cyclical
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Principle number three, learning is about
transforming experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we talked a minute about creating
those experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning actually happens with the
transformation of those experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I mean by this is as
educators, one of our goals or our goal is
[SPEAKER_06]: to help take things that exist out here in
the wide, wide world and help put them
[SPEAKER_06]: here in the brains of our students.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now on my campus tour today, I got to go
into the psychology department.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually saw a bunch of human brains in
jars, which was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's about transforming those
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not as simple as checking into a
hospital and having a surgical procedure
[SPEAKER_06]: where they stitch you open and dump it in
and stitch it closed.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they could do that, we'd be out of a
job because they wouldn't need us to help
[SPEAKER_06]: our students learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's about transforming those
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, and this might sound like a very
simple question, but I think it's an
[SPEAKER_06]: important one as we think about what we do
as educators and what we think about as
[SPEAKER_06]: far as the types of experiences that we
create.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what mechanisms does the human brain
use to get information?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does our brain get information?
[SPEAKER_06]: Our senses, right, our eyes and nose and
ears and mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our brain receives information
through sensory inputs from our five
[SPEAKER_06]: senses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as we are thinking about creating
experiences for our students to transform,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're really thinking about creating
opportunities for our students to use
[SPEAKER_06]: their senses to grasp the information,
the concepts that we want them to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm not going to pass judgment on
Cornell, but I'll point right at the
[SPEAKER_06]: University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: I travel around and look in many of our
college classrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And which two senses do you think that we
probably overuse in the way that we teach
[SPEAKER_06]: them, at least on our campus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eyes and ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eyes and ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes it's not even the eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's a lecture with no
illustration, but it's eyes and ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really rely on the eyes and the
ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some concepts, that's not a bad
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would contend that there are
probably plenty of opportunities where we
[SPEAKER_06]: might think about taste and smell and
touch and what can we do to provide a more
[SPEAKER_06]: sensory rich experience for our students.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of the stuff that you guys do
with the fruits and the vegetables and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff, I mean, shoot, let them taste it,
let them touch it, let them do whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: they smell it, whatever they need to do to
really get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's about, as the information is
traveling into our brain, the more ways
[SPEAKER_06]: and the more modalities that we can get it
in there, the deeper it's going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: embedded and the learning is going to be
even stronger.
[SPEAKER_06]: So schematically, what might that look
like?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a model of cognition called the
information processing model.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this had some parallels to the way a
computer works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually, in educational psychology
during the time when they were developing
[SPEAKER_06]: this model, it was in the early ages of
the computer age.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they drew some parallels from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to me, it makes pretty decent sense
about how that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have some sort of an input
through our senses, transformed into
[SPEAKER_06]: working memory or short-term memory,
and then stored into long-term memory.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we need to use it,
it's pulled back into working memory.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that intuitively makes sense probably
to most of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to put a couple other layers on
that relative to the things we've been
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we think about this in terms of
where these things are happening,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would contend that these things are
happening outside of the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're providing these experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on a daily basis in your classes,
when you create learning activities for
[SPEAKER_06]: your students, you're creating these
sensory input opportunities for the
[SPEAKER_06]: students.
[SPEAKER_06]: This half is what's happening inside up
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part we can see pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part that we hope that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when students are getting it,
we think we see evidence that this is
[SPEAKER_06]: happening, but not always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then to put one more layer on it,
if we think about our learning cycle model
[SPEAKER_06]: that we just saw, this is providing the
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is providing the reflection and
generalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would contend that if we only
focus on this part, this part may or may
[SPEAKER_06]: not be happening as well as we would like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think it's important to really
complete that cycle to where we are
[SPEAKER_06]: providing opportunities for the students
to really internalize that at a cognitive
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our principle number three was that
learning is about transforming
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thinking about the few things that
we just talked about, what are some things
[SPEAKER_06]: that you might think about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can do this different in my
classes that might make a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to
[SPEAKER_11]: ask a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reflection and generalization,
I have a lot of experiences, but to get
[SPEAKER_11]: students to stop and reflect and
generalize, what do you seem to work
[SPEAKER_11]: effectively?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the question you're asking us?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's worked effectively for you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's worked effectively for you?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you well enough to know that you're
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Journaling is used quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And students, you say, OK, we're going to
do a little bit of a journal in class.
[SPEAKER_11]: Students are like, ah, I do that all the
time in all my other classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be journaling.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might just be some discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might just be some thought-provoking
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to come out of TA for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used the Think, Care, Share exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I taught a class in Marvin as
part of a student who were asked to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used Think, Care, Share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped to communicate the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was good because there was a
short sound bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And students took the information in and
then went back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was able to learn something
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a different one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was going to say, have them teach
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have them teach it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything to really just pause for a few
minutes and have the students do something
[SPEAKER_06]: that forces them to think about it,
whether it's a Think, Care, Share.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little activity called a minute
paper where they just, exactly 60 seconds,
[SPEAKER_06]: they write down what they just learned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or anything to get them to discuss with a
colleague, journaling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything just to pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you are accustomed to lecturing
for 50 minutes straight, if you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: make an immediate change, one thing might
be lecture for 10 minutes, then do a quick
[SPEAKER_06]: little activity to get them, allow them to
think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lecture for another 10 minutes,
then give them a little activity to think
[SPEAKER_06]: about what you've done, just to break it
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of the things that we really
want to do and suggest is that implement
[SPEAKER_06]: variety in what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you might like Think, Care,
Share, and it might make sense to you,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that doesn't mean it's going to make
sense to all your students.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you want to implement some variety
in what you do so that your students can,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can reach a greater number of
students.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep,
[SPEAKER_06]: yep, that's an excellent idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just figure out what's going to work for
you, and your situation, your students,
[SPEAKER_06]: and occasionally pause and let your
students actually think about what it is
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Principle four, learning is about building
connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning is about building connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to introduce a term to you
called brain plasticity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cool thing about learning is that
learning actually causes a physical change
[SPEAKER_06]: in the human brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if we think about what we do as
educators, we think about imparting
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge to our students, helping them
learn things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are actually, hopefully, causing some
physical changes in the human brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was a pretty, when I first
learned that, it was a pretty powerful
[SPEAKER_06]: thing to me as an educator to think about,
you know, the efforts that I'm making,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though I may not be able to see them,
is causing a physical change in the human
[SPEAKER_06]: brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if we were wanting to be at a
scientific level and you want to inject a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of dye, in somebody's brain and put
it under a very powerful microscope,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about building and breaking brain
synapses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the natural electrical
connections in the human brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you're interested in this sort
of stuff, you can go Google it and look it
[SPEAKER_06]: up in the biomedical literature.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it really causes a physical change in
the human brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some of you might be comfortable at
the microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly not comfortable at the
microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like to think more of the
theoretical, and what can I see and what
[SPEAKER_06]: can I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a concept called cognitive
schema that, to me, makes a lot of sense
[SPEAKER_06]: in how to think about how people learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we think about cognitive schema,
I visualize it as kind of a web of
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge, with each one of these nodules
being a discrete piece of information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if we go back to our bicycle riding
example, this one might be pedaling,
[SPEAKER_06]: and this one might be balance,
and this one might be turning,
[SPEAKER_06]: and this one might be handlebar breaks,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've got this existing web of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, let me pose a question to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thinking about a novice versus an expert,
how do you think these schema might
[SPEAKER_06]: differ?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the expert is going to have more
connections between here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the expert will probably also have
more nodules.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it'll be much more connected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you all, in your respective areas,
probably have a very well-developed
[SPEAKER_06]: cognitive schema around whatever it is
that you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would contend that your students,
when they come to you, probably have a
[SPEAKER_06]: very skeletal one with either some missing
connections or maybe some connections that
[SPEAKER_06]: are actually wrong and need to be broken.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the challenge is then, so as an
educator, we present that new piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are very good at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can create a lecture.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can create an experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can create a reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do this very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can give lots of new knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's the problem with what we see
right here?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not connected.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, it's not connected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is where you guys get very
frustrated, and I've been there myself,
[SPEAKER_06]: where you say, dang it, I taught them
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How come they can't figure this out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's because they have this piece of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just never made the connections that
it fits out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's just laying out there by
itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you ask them to give you back
that information in the exact same way
[SPEAKER_06]: that you gave them that information,
they can probably do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you ask them to use that
information in a different way,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're like, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not connected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's all about building these
connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that comes back to the notion of
building the opportunities for reflection
[SPEAKER_06]: and generalization to help your students
figure out, how does this new piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge connect with the existing
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the challenging thing is,
you get that brand new class at the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning of the semester, and you've got
30 students in it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're in your class, and each one
of your students has an existing cognitive
[SPEAKER_06]: schema.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many of those 30 students are going to
have the same cognitive schema?
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they might have some shared
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you teach a senior level course in the
major, and your students have taken pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: similar courses to get to that point,
there's probably some similarities in
[SPEAKER_06]: their schema.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're never going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: The challenging part, and also sometimes
the exciting part, is teaching those
[SPEAKER_06]: introductory classes when you don't have a
clue what they know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they bring in a lot of interesting
experiences in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, it's all about building
connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's principle four.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm getting close on time,
aren't I, Neil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I want to save a little bit of time
for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we help the students process,
so we give them that new piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: information, and we introduce that new
concept, there's really two general ways
[SPEAKER_06]: that we can think about that new piece of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either they're going to assimilate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that new concept, that new
experience fits with their existing
[SPEAKER_06]: schema, they're going to kind of say,
OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they might have to accommodate that new
experience if it's different or if it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's all about providing
opportunities to help your students figure
[SPEAKER_06]: out, how does this new piece of
information fit?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where that reflection and that
generalization can help kind of to tie
[SPEAKER_06]: that loop back around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's principle four.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about building connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in your own teaching, what are some
things that you might be able to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some things that you might be
able to do to help your students build
[SPEAKER_06]: those connections?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, yeah, so give them different
opportunities to kind of experience that
[SPEAKER_06]: and help build those connections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very nice if you can organize
your course or whatever around a broader
[SPEAKER_06]: conceptual framework and keep tying back
to that framework to help the students see
[SPEAKER_06]: where it fits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it might be crystal clear to you
that A plus B plus C equals D to students,
[SPEAKER_06]: it may not be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so having that larger graphic
organizer will help do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take a quick, when I teach my
classes, I say we'll take a quick time
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Earlier, that was demonstrating wait time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you ask a question, and you just
wait until it's awkwardly silent,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then someone is willing to give you an
answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you ask a question,
don't feel afraid to have the awkward
[SPEAKER_06]: silence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because sooner or later, someone will give
you a good answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So other ideas about providing that,
helping students make those connections?
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, teaching chemistry, if I'm
teaching the Shotley's principle,
[SPEAKER_04]: a system in stress readjusts to minimize
the stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask them in their personal lives,
where have they been in stress?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They readjust.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tie it back to personal experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, that's an excellent way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so connecting it with, connecting a
new concept to a different kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: experience that has some similarities to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so principle five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Teaching is about creating meaningful
learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Teaching is about creating meaningful
learning experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we talked about the learning cycle,
and we talked about that we are very good
[SPEAKER_06]: at creating learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to throw a couple ideas out
at you about creating meaningful learning
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences, things that are really going
to engage your students and drive things
[SPEAKER_06]: home.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing I want to do is talk to
you about just a couple of differences
[SPEAKER_06]: between teaching and facilitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes we like to throw those words
around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would argue that most of the time,
the meaningful learning experiences are
[SPEAKER_06]: happening when we are facilitating the
learning process as opposed to teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in teaching the teaching,
the teacher delivers the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: In facilitation, the learner constructs
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a subtle difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Teaching instruction is rigidly planned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Facilitation, it's more flexible and
spontaneous, and we're open to those
[SPEAKER_06]: anomalies that happen that we weren't
expecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: In teaching, the teacher has very strict
control over the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: In facilitation, the teacher and the
learner share the control of the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: In teaching, the learners are passive.
[SPEAKER_06]: In facilitation, the learners are active.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would encourage you to think
about your own teaching right now and
[SPEAKER_06]: figure out, OK, where do I fit on this
continuum?
[SPEAKER_06]: And are there some things that you can
change to maybe inch over this way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's a little bit intimidating
sometimes to go into a class session and
[SPEAKER_06]: have a rough idea about what you think is
going to happen in that class session.
[SPEAKER_06]: But based on the interactions with the
students, it might go a slightly different
[SPEAKER_06]: direction than you were planning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's tough sometimes as the
instructor to give up a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_06]: control to say, OK, we're in this
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to help facilitate this
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're not getting off easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to contribute as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd encourage you to think about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other idea I want to present to you is
called Dale's Cone of Experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many of you have heard of Dale's Cone?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so a couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Dale's Cone, and this really,
it's actually pretty dated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a seminal work from Edgar Dale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it comes out of the educational media
literature.
[SPEAKER_06]: What it's really about is we think about
creating those experiences for our
[SPEAKER_06]: students.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have choices to make in how we choose
to present.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything from up here, which is all
symbolized, which is very abstract,
[SPEAKER_06]: to things that are down here, which are
very concrete and very direct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so an example might be if we were
going to teach, how many of you teach some
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of plant identification?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I figured in this department
there'd be a handful of you guys that
[SPEAKER_06]: teach those sort of courses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as we're teaching those sorts of
courses, we can make some choices about
[SPEAKER_06]: how do we want to teach that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we might be up here and talk about
what plants are.
[SPEAKER_06]: What plants look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we might be up here and show drawings
about what plants look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might show pictures of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might come down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when possible and practical,
let them see the real thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would encourage you to think
about, as you are teaching concepts in
[SPEAKER_06]: your classes, when it's possible and when
it's practical to think about what can I
[SPEAKER_06]: do to provide direct personal interaction
with the students with the concepts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, logistically, and sometimes it's just
impractical to do those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would contend, if you can let them
see the real thing and do the real thing
[SPEAKER_06]: and touch the real thing, then give them
the real thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not come up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would encourage you to think down
there, where we are really in the doing
[SPEAKER_06]: phase, as opposed to the observing or the
symbolizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing I want you to think about is,
what I call, let's add some real world
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences to what we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would propose that in a class,
you might add some things like guest
[SPEAKER_06]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you guys have world class
faculty here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's hypothesize for a minute that
maybe there is an expert that knows
[SPEAKER_06]: something better than someone here does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not invite that person in or Skype
that person?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the beautiful thing now with
technology is you can bring anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can bring anybody into the classroom
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Field trips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's about going to see the real
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your students involved in research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do service learning projects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do outdoor adventure learning sorts of
things where you're getting the students
[SPEAKER_06]: some direct purposeful experience with
those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, activities outside of a course that
are more at the program level might be
[SPEAKER_06]: things like internships, study abroad
experiences, or broader research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Projects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know about on this campus,
but I suspect you guys are similar to us,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we've got a lot of bright,
energetic students that are begging for
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on our campus, we probably don't make
good enough use of all these energetic,
[SPEAKER_06]: bright young people in the other work that
we do, in the research and extension
[SPEAKER_06]: activities that we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would contend that there are probably
some great opportunities to get those
[SPEAKER_06]: students actively engaged in a variety of
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So principle five was creating those
meaningful learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're going to talk about,
let's take this home.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're going to go back to another
think, pair, share.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to ask you guys two very
specific, very concrete things that you
[SPEAKER_06]: could take away from my discussion today
to immediately, at least in cases that the
[SPEAKER_06]: faculty immediately, for the grad students
at some point in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two things that you can immediately take
away to make an impact on your teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: So think about that for a sec,
and then pair up with someone around you
[SPEAKER_06]: and share your ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's reconvene.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get a few ideas shared, and then
we'll save a few minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let's hear a few examples.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Geneva, I'll give you guys a heads up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to call on you guys in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys can be thinking too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever a few examples of things that
you could immediately implement in your
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching for the faculty or for the grad
students, something that you could to do
in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a few examples.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, not lecture as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, yeah, help your students draw the
connections out of a guest speaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just this anomaly where this
strange person was here for a day,
[SPEAKER_06]: and now they're gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pull some meaning out of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another example.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after we've had that experience,
help the students kind of draw some.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't just a cool day outside the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually, there was some meaning
out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Help the students pull that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Geneva, what about you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's something that some of you guys
might choose to implement?
[SPEAKER_12]: Teaching a co-taught course with three
sections and different instructors,
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of struggle with the integration.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think maybe at the beginning you used
that schema as a way to show interactions
[SPEAKER_12]: within the components where we have
different people talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about one more example from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I used a professional audience
instead of a student audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Passing around something physical for them
to play with with their hands,
[SPEAKER_09]: demonstrates the principle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you guys are going to have a lot of
kinesthetic learners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the danger is sometimes that
can be a distraction where they might be
[SPEAKER_06]: playing with it and not listen to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least they're getting some of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other examples in here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe we can shift over to questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the world is our campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then particularly now with
technologies, we can travel around the
[SPEAKER_06]: world in a very easy way.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past, it hasn't been quite so easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we've got a few minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll take a few questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, assuming that the students actually
do it, it is better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a concept now and I'm actually
playing around with it in one of my
[SPEAKER_06]: undergrad classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the flipped classroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys heard of that terminology
before?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the whole notion of let's take the
basic knowledge level stuff and do that as
[SPEAKER_06]: homework in the form of online lectures
and readings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's use class time then for the
deeper discussions and the reflections on
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you might think about, you know,
are there some ways that I can do some
[SPEAKER_06]: things?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there some things that I can take out
of the face to face time to provide more
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities for the face to face time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many of you carry around
something that looks like this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of you probably do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate to break it to you,
but everything that every one of us knows
[SPEAKER_06]: is available on this little device.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the benefit our students get from
us is not the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can get the knowledge anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get the benefit of interacting with
us so that we can think like a plant
[SPEAKER_06]: breeder or think like a weed scientist or
think like an educator or think like
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the students can learn and interact
with us so that they can learn to think
[SPEAKER_06]: like whatever it is we want them to think
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about that first video with
the young mom saying, very good,
[SPEAKER_05]: very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's Carol Dweck who had some
groundbreaking research that looked at the
[SPEAKER_05]: impact of all of this positive judgment,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this praise, you're so smart,
you're so beautiful, you're so great,
[SPEAKER_05]: is creating a generation of risk averse
learners who are really afraid to make
[SPEAKER_05]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're seeing an impact of that
in our classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some very concrete ways in which
you have fostered a healthy risk taking in
[SPEAKER_05]: your teaching?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a little bit of expertise,
but I can share some personal examples.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's about creating an environment
where being unsuccessful is OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's about learning from those
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I teach classes on teaching methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I teach all day about how to teach.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then conversely, at the end of the
semester, I ask my students to evaluate my
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little bit intimidating to talk
about the entire semester about,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is how you teach good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, evaluate my teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will periodically throw myself out
there and say, OK, I just did this
[SPEAKER_06]: activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's critique it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I model the behavior that I hope
that they can see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also, in the way that I evaluate
student work, I tend to be very proactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very constructive in providing
constructive feedback.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I try not to be penalizing in the way
that I provide that feedback.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you think about this?
[SPEAKER_06]: What could you do to make it better?
[SPEAKER_06]: And to provide some constructive feedback.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also try to provide very quick
feedback to my students.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we're teaching a course where
the concepts build on each other,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you've taught concept one and then
tested it, and then you're on concept four
[SPEAKER_06]: before you get feedback from concept one,
the students might have some
[SPEAKER_06]: misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even know that they have by the
time that they get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our students at Florida are like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've gotten straight A's their entire
life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so anything less than a straight A is
failure to them, even though they haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: earned a straight A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The classroom becomes a very fun and
dynamic place, although it can be a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit intimidating at times, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't know what's coming next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of giving information to
students, in many cases, you can,
[SPEAKER_12]: say, give a relationship between two
factors in a table of numbers or in a
[SPEAKER_12]: graph.
[SPEAKER_12]: Personally, I engage so much more.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sticks with me a lot better if it's
a graph form.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see the shape.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see the spacing between them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for a lot of people, that is the way
that they like to receive information.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would encourage you to think about,
in a given class of any size, you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to have different kinds of students in
that class.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as instructors, we tend to be most
comfortable teaching the way that we like
[SPEAKER_06]: to have been taught when we were students,
but to recognize that all your students
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's about presenting things with
some variety in the way that you do that,
[SPEAKER_06]: so that you present those graphs and those
charts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to reach those kinds of a
student.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're going to deliver that
fabulous lecture that's very engaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to reach those kind of
students.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're going to do an activity
that involves the students out in the
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to engage those kind of
students.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really about providing that
variety of different kinds of experiences
[SPEAKER_06]: for the students.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would look for opportunities and
tying it back to when we talked about the
[SPEAKER_06]: sensory inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for opportunities to engage all five
senses when practical and when
[SPEAKER_06]: appropriate, as opposed to just the visual
and auditory that we often do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're being introduced to the MOOCs,
where you have 10,000 students,
[SPEAKER_10]: none of whom you can see.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I understand now,
on the reflection and generalization part
[SPEAKER_10]: of the learning process, it's really done
by small groups of students with each
[SPEAKER_10]: other.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's about the end of my knowledge
right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But could you touch on how this process
works in that giant setting?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shipped into the online environment,
it does create some different challenges.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also creates some opportunities.
[SPEAKER_06]: And reflection does not have to be just in
small groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to have some learners
that are very social in the way that they
[SPEAKER_06]: learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to want to share with
their peers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're also going to have some
learners that are very introspective and
[SPEAKER_06]: like to think things through themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so just providing that pause time for
them to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in an online environment,
it might be through some sort of a
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion board, where maybe you're not
forcing them to respond to anybody else's
[SPEAKER_06]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just giving them an opportunity to
put their own thoughts down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe it's a guided reflective journal,
where over the course of the class,
[SPEAKER_06]: they've got to do an entry once a day,
once a week, once however that is
[SPEAKER_06]: structured.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as I said earlier, there's not a
magic bullet that is going to fit
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody, which is challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also can be fun, because it gives
us as the educators the opportunity to try
[SPEAKER_06]: out some different things and to
experiment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that I try to model
this in my own professional life,
[SPEAKER_06]: too, is it's about not being satisfied
with the status quo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's about trying out new things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned earlier, I'm trying out the
flipped classroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the second semester now I've
done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went through the learning cycle
myself the first semester and figured out
[SPEAKER_06]: some things that worked and some things
that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm tenured, so it's a little bit
easier for me to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: flexible and spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_06]: The untenured faculty probably have to be
a little bit more focused and a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more norm reference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It means that the face-to-face time is the
instructor lecturing and giving
[SPEAKER_06]: information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the students then outside of
class time take that information and apply
[SPEAKER_06]: it through some sort of a problem set,
homework, project, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flipped classroom does that 180.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you create a way to deliver the
lecture part outside a classroom,
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps through some online recorded
lectures, readings, those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you use the class time, the
face-to-face time, for problem activities,
[SPEAKER_06]: inquiry activities, those sorts of things
to where if we think about, are you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: familiar with Bloom's taxonomy and the
levels of cognition?
[SPEAKER_06]: So delivering the lecture part,
that's oftentimes at lower levels of
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloom's taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem sets are at the upper levels
of Bloom's taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when they're with us, under expert
supervision, we're doing the low level
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We send them home by themselves to work on
the upper level stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They reach a problem where they're
struggling and they're stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the flipped classroom, you do that
just 180 to where they're doing the higher
[SPEAKER_06]: level stuff with you, to where you're
helping them work through issues and
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges and things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it has not been a perfect switch
for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm knocking on wood that the second
iteration will go a little bit smoother
[SPEAKER_06]: than the first iteration.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a different model for the
students, because the students aren't used
[SPEAKER_06]: to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it takes a little bit of training
on their part to get them prepared for
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to get them focused on
actual learning as opposed to just getting
[SPEAKER_06]: the grade, which that can be challenging
on some of these students.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are we doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Geneva.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
