[SPEAKER_00]: Cornus moss or Cornelian cherry,
it's not a cherry at all, it's a dogwood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it hails from Turkey and Southern
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rumored to be the wood that the
Trojan horse was made from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are nice small trees, pretty
drought-tolerant, have very distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: red fruit on them at this time of year,
which are quite edible, and if you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly sour fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's take a look.
Thank you.
