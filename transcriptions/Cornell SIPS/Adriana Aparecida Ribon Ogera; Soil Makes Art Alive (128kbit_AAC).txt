[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my great honor to have brought Dr.
Ribon here from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have spent the last week and a half
together, and it's been an incredibly huge
[SPEAKER_00]: honor for our lab and also the start,
I think, of a really exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration regarding communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to expand both of our efforts
to a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Ribon is responsible for the
disciplines of pedology and soil physics
[SPEAKER_00]: at the State University of Goias.
[SPEAKER_00]: She coordinates the extension and research
project on soil education for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also the deputy director of
division four of the Brazilian Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Society, Soil Environment and
Society, and is also the deputy
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinator of commission 4.1,
Soil Education and Public Perception of
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the creator of Fun Soil Profiles,
which are a very, very big deal in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's going to talk about how she uses
art to communicate the importance of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science to a wide range of audiences
throughout Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's also going to discuss the
history of soil and art in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplines, including literature,
poetry, painting, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her daughter is going to be translating in
real time from Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please join me in welcoming Dr. Ribon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before anything, I'm so happy to be here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a lot of days here, and it was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so good for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm going to talk about how we work
with soil in Brazil in this seminar about
[SPEAKER_05]: soil makes art alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pedological greetings for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a pedologist and a soil educator.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are so many ways to work with the
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for that, you need to see beyond your
look in the art's superficies.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be connected with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the soil education project,
we work with soil in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk about many ways to work
with soil in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these ways to work with soil is the
construction of soil with these characters
[SPEAKER_05]: that I made.
[SPEAKER_05]: I start with the Brazilian soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I imagine why not bring the concept of
soil in a simple way, in a fun way and a
[SPEAKER_05]: logical way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I bring the sound profile of
soils according to soil taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 12 types of soil orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I published a book in the 100th
century in Florence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought a little bit of the book and
I'm going to talk about the characters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a volcano, just like the god of fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in Rumbones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I represent the order of the Andean suns.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a volcano, like the god of fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I live in volcanoes, I represent
the order of Andean soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm formed by volcanic ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: The term Andean comes from the Japanese
word Ando.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it means dark soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the duo Alf and Uti.
[SPEAKER_05]: We form a charming and lively band called
Argilica.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have in common is a big horizon
with the increased clay content.
[SPEAKER_05]: We represent the orders of Alf soils and
Uti soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alf is younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: And less weltered than Uti.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the oldest one.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Argilson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was inspired by the cowboys from Texas,
from here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I represent the order of Argil soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: The name comes from the Latin word Aridus.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: The baby represents the order of the
Andean soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: My main characters are that I very depend
on my parents and I'm still in
[SPEAKER_05]: development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I represent the order of the Andean
soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look like a snowman because I live in
cold regions of the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my profile I have a layer that is
always frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The name comes from the Greek jelly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means very cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Cranby.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like humid or even flooded areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a very charming little monster.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I represent the order of Hito soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: My profile has more organic matter mixed
with minerals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I store a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water and carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: The name Histo comes from the Greek word
Histos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it means tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Young.
[SPEAKER_05]: I represent the order of Incepti soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: The name Young.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the case that I'm growing to changes of
transformation in my life and I just got
[SPEAKER_05]: graduated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I finished my student life to begin my
professional life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Uncle Molly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a rich farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I represent the order of the Mollysols.
[SPEAKER_05]: My main character is a surface of a region
rich in organic matter and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: The name came from the Latin word Mollis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it means soft.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Grandma Oxidica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I represent the order of the Oxisols.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live largely in warm and humid climates.
[SPEAKER_05]: My main characteristics are a deep soil
profile rich in oxides, weathered and very
[SPEAKER_05]: involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's talking that this is a
[SPEAKER_05]: field to her home in Goyates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she is Lady Sols, a famous artist that
does paintings with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: She represents the order of the Spodosols.
[SPEAKER_05]: My profile look like real paintings from
the natural arts.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name comes from the Greek word Spodos,
which means woosh ash, wood ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my superpowers is the capacity for
expansion and contraction because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: changes in water content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I represent the order of Verdi soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: The term Verdi comes from the Latin word
verto.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means to turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys have liked this character.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after, you guys can say to me which
order is the most prevalent here in this
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit of the
profiles of soil that are degradation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the degradation soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Erodilson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, his degradation by the Erosion.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Distrophix.
[SPEAKER_05]: She loses nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's taking IV nutrients, kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Compactation.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was degraded by Compactation.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Degradelson.
[SPEAKER_06]: His soil penetration is 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's very high.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the burnings, he was degraded by the
burnings.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Degradivus.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was degraded by the Erosion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now she's going to talk a little bit about
WRB.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a new character called Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a soil scientist and president of
the group of work WRB from 2010 to 2020.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that he has no shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about his connection with soil and
nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he forces how the soil is so close to
us and he needs to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in every work in the field,
Peter is always without shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has no shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: More characters.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a lot of them, but it's just a
little bit of her work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, she's going to publish a book
with all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There in Brazil, we work also with the
profile soils in a didactic way.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are dolls made with soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: These students made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Podology students.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of types of materials made
with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all these works they're going to have
notes to the students in the discipline.
[SPEAKER_05]: After it goes to the lab to kids to watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: A kid watching the work made.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a student from the PhD.
[SPEAKER_05]: A PhD student.
[SPEAKER_05]: She made dolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earth dolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she also work with child.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have colleagues that works soil
with Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: This my colleague is a professor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her work is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we work too with the art with soil
painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: She always said that the art with soil is
the most deep expression of how we can see
[SPEAKER_05]: soil with our souls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris is an example of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are arts with colorful sense of a
artist there in Goiás.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here the kids from the school.
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with soil painting with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And kids go also to the lab to work with
soil painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we took old boxes that people
were going to throw away and we transform
[SPEAKER_05]: in soil profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So beautiful this photo soil made of a box
of milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here student.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what she made in the Podology class.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other arts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This yellow soil is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is just soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arts made by students in the class of
Podology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have notes for this to take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Students undergraduate students with the
kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Painting with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here a colleague from Embrapa that is a
governmental organ there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also does painting with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Capeche.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a project of the professor Adriana
Meira.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also works with soil painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here a work from Yvesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are artists too that paint with
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone wants to see more of his
painting she has a painting there at
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine's office.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Characters made of soil painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also from this professor Paraíba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now soil and literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The construction of kids books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some books made by me and a
colleague from Rio de Janeiro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is called Marco Gervasio.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she made herself.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is her life history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her passion with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other books from this colleague from
Paraná.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the name of the project is Soil in the
school WEMP.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He won the concurs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: FAO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil and literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk about poetry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know you or you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I see a picture I want to write a
poetry about soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil in poetry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It brings sensibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Formation of the imaginary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Symbolic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Creativity.
[SPEAKER_05]: The observation of experiences that we
live in our daily life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially for a child.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the need to transform things that
seems there are less work in soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a poetry.
[SPEAKER_06]: For colleagues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poetry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_05]: He writes poetry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is from Pará, Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Record of times gone by.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil is endowed with great beauty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And its horizons are contained.
[SPEAKER_05]: The transformation of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The material that gave its origin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enduring the full force of the climate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Balances itself onto relief in vertigo.
[SPEAKER_05]: With various organisms above.
[SPEAKER_05]: And time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It passed without making a sound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are books from my project that I
also published.
[SPEAKER_07]: She invited all of us to write a poem and
send it to her.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then she can publish it on her book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you know that soil also can be
construction by dance?
[SPEAKER_05]: We work soil with this choreographer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The students can dance a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have soil concepts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This work is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the construction of the concept of soil
to the community that can hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: He works all the sides of soil with signs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is from Roraima.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a colleague that works with me from
USP with soil education.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is the director of the soil education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Deborah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She works soil, pedology and all your
delicious food.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally love the concepts of soil and
how we work with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a museum that I visited last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Museum of Soil in Roraima.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to say this in English.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil by itself is the more pure
expression of art.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a group of pedologists,
women.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do excursions in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are artists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now to think, connect with soil and the
imaginable can happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a photographer.
[SPEAKER_05]: His photos are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also an artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil is friendship.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for everyone that welcomed me in
those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, how do you see soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see food, knowledge, poetry,
literature, music, art.
[SPEAKER_05]: And love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for more information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question about the ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is clearly some cultural
significance to some of these ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have some idea about how you
come up with these ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how these ideas have, what the impact
is on the cultural component of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the back and forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pedology, there is a lot of technical
words.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw the students, they didn't want
to, they were not interested in the
[SPEAKER_05]: classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt the necessity of link the orders
and the terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the way that is more simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: The simple way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, when I thought initially was for
kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then just grew up, like was something
big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now we use in the classes for
undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something that is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Brazil, the extension is in the
discipline.
[SPEAKER_05]: The extension is in the discipline.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we involve the community with the
students of the undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the students, they began to have
more responsibility to work with the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm coming from also, not just the
teaching, but also the extension
[SPEAKER_03]: component.
[SPEAKER_05]: The connection, the information that is
important to the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And first everyone was saying,
who wants to write about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants to do characters with this,
with soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now everyone is doing it in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important thing is this
connection and love with soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're a kid or when you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecting people to soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding on to this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that different types of
students are attracted to it now that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding in this artistic component
to your education?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's bringing in new students
that weren't previously interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's bringing in other
students that weren't interested in soil
[SPEAKER_05]: now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think more people are coming?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: This gets me emotional.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have a very large search for
this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I give online courses to other
researchers, teachers, students who are
[SPEAKER_06]: interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people are looking for this
project and she gives classes to
[SPEAKER_05]: searchers, professors, and online classes
for professors.
[SPEAKER_05]: To them to use this in their classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has this program been going on
and have you noticed any tangible benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: How long has this program been going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how long has it been going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I stayed working at the same place for 4
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I did one lecture and it went
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was working in the same spot there
at the university for 4 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then she gave a talk and then everyone
was... She gave a talk in the congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brazilian soil congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we are not just in Brazil but...
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you planning on translating using the
fun soil profiles?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like translating that information into
different languages?
[SPEAKER_04]: English, etc?
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have this material in French.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Spanish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will be translated into Mandarin
the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the Chinese congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a site and they are already saying
to me to translate in English so everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: can access it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm working in...
[SPEAKER_05]: know English.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to know English.
I'm studying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a necessity today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is less on the science and more on
the creativity side.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you come up with the particular
characters or the particular orders?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you come up with the particular
characters?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like... The minor... The... Particular is
not the same thing in Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters that are of the most
particular orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: The minorities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already worked on this in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a lot of material with the most
specific classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: She already has this in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she works with the particular ones
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she already...
[SPEAKER_05]: But she wants to know how you came up with
this idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of the character?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the most specific characters.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I see the idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you come up with this idea?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in Brazil I work, for example,
she says, with the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Brazil, he works with the soil,
the agricultural soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: He so temporizes the... I don't know how
to say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Acric soil in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she already has these orders in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was easier to her to transform the
characters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you did the Brazilian one first and
then... So you did the Brazilian first and
[SPEAKER_05]: then the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there I already work... Sub-ordering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there I work with divided orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sub-divided orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: She already have this to the
post-graduating students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for under-graduating is so
specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she use to the post-graduating.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she takes these steps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now she's working with WRB.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she doesn't have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to speak in Portuguese and then
I'll translate to English.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud to have you here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I even saw some pictures of you on
Instagram with people, you teaching the
[SPEAKER_07]: students.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were smiling while you were
teaching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when I was there 10 years ago,
15 years ago, the solo physics class.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was almost a torture.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were so apprehensive and it was hard to
learn in a situation like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think with an attitude like that,
it's a more welcoming environment and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: easier to learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So congratulations for the work you did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying that thank you for the
work that you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember when I was a student in
Brazil, like 15 years ago, Genesis and the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil profile and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember people were almost crying in
that class.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the hardest one in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I saw her pictures on Instagram,
people were smiling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, this is different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'm able to see her pictures,
how the students interacted with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really proud having been here watching
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 15 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to have knowledge
because this is like you guys bring me
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge and I gave them knowledge too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to bring friends too in my
heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
