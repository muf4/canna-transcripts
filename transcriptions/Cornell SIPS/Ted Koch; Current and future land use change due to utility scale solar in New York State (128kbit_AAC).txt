[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks, Peter, for that great
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ted Koch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the past year or so, Peter and I
have been working on trying to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the land use implications of solar in New
York State, what it's looked like up to
[SPEAKER_01]: this point, and even try to extend some
modeling into the future to see how this
[SPEAKER_01]: new demand for renewable energy is going
to shape our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we embarked on this analysis,
we had a few simple questions that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: soon see were a little bit more complex to
get to the bottom of than we initially
[SPEAKER_01]: expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our overall goals were to identify
where solar is being developed across New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State, analyze the trends in what's
happening in terms of land use for these
[SPEAKER_01]: sites, so what were they before they
became solar farms, and then, looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward into the future, try to quantify
how much solar we're actually going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need all the way across the state in order
to meet certain renewable energy goals
[SPEAKER_01]: that are continuously evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, if we get good results from
that, what will the land use implications
[SPEAKER_01]: be of that quantity of solar?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the overarching context of this is the
CLCPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an ambitious piece of climate
legislation put forth by New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a slew of goals, but the ones
that we are looking at are its goal to
[SPEAKER_01]: become entirely carbon neutral or
decarbonized energy grid by 2040,
[SPEAKER_01]: so in other words, not producing
electricity through fossil fuel
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also mandates the decarbonization of
many key sectors that are currently
[SPEAKER_01]: powered by fossil fuel, so that's
transportation and space heating mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, it has the ultimate goal of
getting to complete carbon neutrality by
[SPEAKER_01]: 2050, and so that means that even if we
are generating some carbon emissions,
[SPEAKER_01]: those emissions are being captured within
the state by our forests and soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along with this sweeping piece of
climate legislation, they also put out
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit of analysis that they
commissioned, and this graph here shows
[SPEAKER_01]: the expected energy generation and the
sources of that generation from now until
[SPEAKER_01]: that future change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the target of 2050.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of these colored bars represents
an energy source, and the two key
[SPEAKER_01]: takeaways to take from this are that A,
we are going to be consuming vastly more
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity in the future than we are
currently, so that means that not only do
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to replace these fossil fuel
energy sources, we also have to add
[SPEAKER_01]: additional capacity to accommodate things
that are coming online, such as electric
[SPEAKER_01]: cars, electric space heating, all these
things that currently take carbon emitting
[SPEAKER_01]: fossil fuels that are ultimately going to
be powered by renewable electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing is this large orange
section in the middle of each bar that's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out pretty small and getting very
large by 2050, that represents solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only is solar going to be doing a
lot of heavy lifting, it is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the dominant source of energy in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wind is pretty substantial,
but solar will be, at least that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipation of New York State,
the dominant source of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I get into our analysis,
I just want to cover some jargon so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we all know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of the sticker value
that people put on a power generation
[SPEAKER_01]: source, in this case, solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means the maximum output of a solar
site under ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this does not take into account
regional or weather anomalies,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as clouds or nighttime or dust or
seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of a blanket statement
that can be applied to a solar system in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona and the same size system in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to start to understand a little
bit about how a system is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: performing, we want to use capacity
factor, and that just kind of incorporates
[SPEAKER_01]: real world performances of the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I'll be talking about two main
solar technologies today, single axis
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are sites that have mechanical
linkages and motors that allow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the sun on one axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either east to west following it
throughout the day, or north to south,
[SPEAKER_01]: but technically up and down to follow the
sun as it moves higher and lower in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, fixed axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are sites that just don't move at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at a single angle, and they'll
remain there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't expect you to read every node
in our analysis flowchart, but broadly,
[SPEAKER_01]: our analysis consisted of synthesizing
existing data, creating a few new data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets to fill in holes where there was
uncertainty in the existing data,
[SPEAKER_01]: modeling out future scenarios,
and evaluating what those could look like
[SPEAKER_01]: under different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so when trying to understand any sort
of system, starting with the most easily
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible data is generally a good start
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, New York State has a
great treasure trove of data that's
[SPEAKER_01]: publicly available, where they track most
commercial sized solar sites with data
[SPEAKER_01]: including their capacity, their output and
performance, and their approximate
[SPEAKER_01]: location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just by taking all this, compiling it
together, and setting a trend over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are able to see how solar has been
growing and what specific trends are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this graph here on the right,
on the horizontal axis, we have years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the vertical axis, we have capacity
in megawatts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see the dotted lines represent
sites that are currently incomplete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the solid lines represent sites that
are done and are now performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red represents fixed axis sites,
and blue represents single axis,
[SPEAKER_01]: just in case you can't see the legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the beginning, around 2016,
when solar was first starting to take off,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was almost zero single axis tracked
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now we can see in the developing
sites that those single axis tracked
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is rapidly taking off and even
looks like it might start to outperform
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed axis sites in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also see various details on how
long it takes to develop sites and what
[SPEAKER_01]: the rate of capacity growth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said in the beginning,
our main goal is to understand land use
[SPEAKER_01]: implications of solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't get to the bottom of that
with an approximate point location on a
[SPEAKER_01]: map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took it a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found these sites in aerial
imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we traced their fence lines manually
to create a polygon data set of about 150
[SPEAKER_01]: sites that were randomly selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: A key piece of our analysis is that we're
looking at the fenced area of these sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at a solar site,
the array, which is these vertical black
[SPEAKER_01]: lines here surrounded by the blue,
the boundary, that's going to be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: impactful part of the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's going to be a lot more
shade underneath that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some compaction from the
construction of the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly going to be dry and wet
areas because they're blocking rain and
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrating it in specific locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a farmer, if you're a land
developer, you're going to look at a site
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, all right, I'm not going to be
able to access the inside of that fence
[SPEAKER_01]: the way I usually would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our intents and purposes,
that fence line is the maximum area that
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be taken out of commission for
regular use by a solar site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, to my knowledge, the first
study that actually looked at this
[SPEAKER_01]: specific area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were also curious about larger sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are sites that are over 25
megawatts in capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the nearest one that's kind of in
this scale is going in the Yellow Barn
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of you might be familiar with that
locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are sites that are hundreds,
if not thousands, of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mainly in the hundreds,
but they are very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since none of these sites have been
completed at this point, we had to rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: site planning documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we georeferenced those, blew them up to
scale, and then traced them as if it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: site on aerial imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this, we were able to understand
a key parameter of solar energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is power density.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is power density?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a metric of how much energy or how
much power they are producing for a given
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important not just for
developers who are trying to get the most
[SPEAKER_01]: output they can from the smallest area
possible, because you have to pay rent on
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also important for those of us
who use land for things that aren't solar
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who are studying habitat,
people who are farming, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons you want to get as much energy out
of a small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a trend that we've
generally been seeing, more panels on
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller footprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then digging into that relationship
with site type, we're able to see that,
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly, these larger sites,
these 25 megawatt NOVA sites, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: performing the poorest.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, they are not able to
produce as much energy per given area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then single-axis tracked sites,
somewhat less surprisingly, are also not
[SPEAKER_01]: quite as good as fixed-axis sites because
they have to be spread out a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more to allow tilting to not shade the
panels in front or behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plot shows power density in
megawatts per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the three technologies are on the
horizontal axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 150 sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had their fence boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been enough to start
looking at what types of land were
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath these sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we wanted to get the most
comprehensive picture of where solar is
[SPEAKER_01]: going in New York state as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to do that, instead of meticulously
manually digitizing every site I could
[SPEAKER_01]: find, we got a computer to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took that 150 polygon data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aerial imagery from the USDA trained a
computer model to detect sites from that
[SPEAKER_01]: imagery and then ran it on all of the
imagery in New York state for 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results of that are we found about
509 sites, which occupy about 3,700
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on our power density estimates,
we predict that they were outputting at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point about 2,300 megawatts of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as we know, this is the most
comprehensive data set of where solar is
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several different state and
federal data sets as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found a lot of them are pretty
incomplete and only find about half of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this data set that we hope is as
comprehensive as possible, we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: perform some land cover analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, looking at what the land
was before it became a solar site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do this, we overlaid our polygons
with a data set called the crop data
[SPEAKER_01]: layer, which is produced by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does a good job of trying to
estimate what each square foot,
[SPEAKER_01]: or in this case, 30 square meter,
30 meter on a side cell area in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: state was, whether that's forest or
pasture or grassland or corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, in this golden bar
here, annual row crops were the dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: previous land cover of all these solar
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, about 864 hectares of annual row
crop land was occupied by these sites that
[SPEAKER_01]: we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's followed by hay, pasture,
unfortunately, forest, and then some
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa, so more high intensity forage
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became more apparent to us that there
are some inaccuracies in the crop data
[SPEAKER_01]: layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unsurprisingly, it's difficult to tell
what type of crop is in any given area
[SPEAKER_01]: just from satellite imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we particularly found that there's
a lot of inaccuracy in this pasture
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking a little bit into the
literature, we found a report that checked
[SPEAKER_01]: the discrepancies between the census of ag
data that New York and the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government collects every five years and
this crop data layer data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that there's approximately
650,000 hectares of land in New York state
[SPEAKER_01]: that is classified as active agricultural
land by the CDL, but is actually what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're calling former agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is land that is probably
something you're all familiar with,
[SPEAKER_01]: just grassy fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody mows them once or twice a
year to keep them from turning into
[SPEAKER_01]: forests, but ultimately, they are not
being used for commercial agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is our main focus and what we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by taking the ratios that the study
found on a crop by crop basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out that about 30% of land
considered pasture by the CDL is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: former agricultural land, we're able to
get to this 16% or 607 hectare figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, essentially,
a lot of the land that we are finding out
[SPEAKER_01]: or appears to be active agricultural land
may, in fact, just be grassy fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of makes sense if you're
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers who have active agricultural land
that they're tilling or grazing or haying
[SPEAKER_01]: are more likely to try to get people to
develop solar on the less productive land
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not actually using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more to a given area than just
what it's being used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also wanted to see what types of
soils are being covered by solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because a piece of land isn't being
used for agricultural uses today doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it couldn't be tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a good indicator of whether land
could potentially be used for agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: is its soil quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for this, we used a data set called
the Mineral Soil Groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a soil ranking system
developed by New York State primarily for
[SPEAKER_01]: tax reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's useful in the case of solar
because there are restrictions on what
[SPEAKER_01]: types of high quality soils can be used
for solar sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, if you're a developer,
you're coming into a site and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put a soil or facility there, if it's over
50% high quality, agriculturally suitable
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, there are going to be penalties that
you have to pay for converting that out of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that the dominant soil group that
is being covered by solar is Mineral Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: Group 5, which is right in the middle of
the scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the
[SPEAKER_01]: best and 10 being the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is about 44% of all land under
solar that is in this high quality Mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil Groups 1 through 4 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not just an indicator that
we're losing a lot of good soil to these
[SPEAKER_01]: solar sites, but also that these
incentives that are in place to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: dissuade developers from using high
quality soils, they're not quite working
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as we would hope they would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to get a little bit inside the
mind of the developers, because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be what ultimately informs where
we expect solar to go, is the choices of
[SPEAKER_01]: developers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started looking at the distance to
transmission lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be up to a million dollars a mile
to run a grid interconnect from a solar
[SPEAKER_01]: site to a transmission line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so obviously, that's a lot of
incentive for solar to be built very close
[SPEAKER_01]: to those power lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to take a closer look,
and we found that that is indeed the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about every site was within five
kilometers of a solar site, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: a few that ventured a little bit further
up to 15 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will come back later on in the
presentation, but distance to transmission
[SPEAKER_01]: lines is an incredibly strong predictor of
where solar is ultimately likely to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also took a look at slope of these
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that in terms of how steep
developers are willing to build on,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a little bit more flexible than
some of these other site characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I jump into the future part of
this analysis, are there any questions so
[SPEAKER_01]: far?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm unloading a lot of information
on everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Louis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a line, this means that you
can go to that line right there,
[SPEAKER_03]: or there has to be some kind of conversion
plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if there is capacity,
and if the solar site is large enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will create a substation to boost the
voltage up to what's necessary for the
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnection.
[SPEAKER_01]: An important point, though, is also we did
not model if these transmission lines have
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity for solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes they are, in fact,
full, especially if they're these
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission lines funneling
hydroelectricity from Canada downstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, typically the best location is
next to a substation, because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to get the power up to the
necessary voltages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like if the site can just be
really close to a transmission line,
[SPEAKER_01]: the developers will build the
infrastructure needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Hannah?
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some interesting information at
the beginning that talked about how the
[SPEAKER_07]: single access track took longer to finish
and was also less efficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any cases that you would want to
use those?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or why have people been building them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so maybe I didn't do the best job of
explaining the differences in power and
[SPEAKER_01]: energy dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So single access track sites, because they
have to be spread out a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rows of panels themselves,
in order to avoid shading, they typically
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lower power density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this means that if you took the
sticker rating of every single panel in
[SPEAKER_01]: the site, and added it up, and divided it
by the acres, that would be lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, because they're tilting to follow
the sun, they actually do capture more
[SPEAKER_01]: energy throughout the day than a fixed
access site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you spread that out over a
year, their yearly energy output is
[SPEAKER_01]: marginally greater than a fixed access
site would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So about the printed power density,
also you mentioned, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: the solar panel orientation east and west,
or sometimes the north and south.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that case, your mention is the same as
power density, or beneficial to tracking
[SPEAKER_06]: or a fixed case.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same?
[SPEAKER_06]: If we just add the lower parameters of our
solar panel orientation, it's the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you asking if single access sites that
go east to west, and they're tracking?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put that sort of orientation that
comes to the north and the south,
[SPEAKER_06]: in that case, what you mentioned before is
the same situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't look at, within single access
tracking sites, if the power production is
[SPEAKER_01]: the same in the east-west orientation as
the north-south orientation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just about every site that we
looked at does track.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run north to south, and they track
east to west.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not information I could speak
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering, could you go back real
quick to the density side of the power
[SPEAKER_05]: density?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remote's a little slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned that the fixed access
having, now, are these significantly
[SPEAKER_05]: different, these SAT?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I just don't understand the
magnitude of power density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the access is scaled pretty
narrowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are not substantially different,
but they are significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the single access, sorry,
the large sites, they're quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: poorer performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other two groups, and then the
single access and the fixed access,
[SPEAKER_01]: small sites are closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Peter?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of overlap between
the two there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another something remaining to be
explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there room to exploit that variation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you push them higher within that
range?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's controlling that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there is a lot of variation in
all these data sets, and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we think, is primarily driven by,
how developers build their fences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty big takeaway is
that you can save a lot of land just by
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing your area, your panel area to
fence area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, we live in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a patchwork landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are dealing with hedgerows and
outcroppings, and really, the shape is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a perfect rectangle every
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you say large sites use less land,
the efficiency is primarily, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from the orientation of the panels,
maximizing area of land.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why their power density is less
than someone who has smaller land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't actually have the ability to
get into how they're lower in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: power density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Power density is ultimately a factor of
the site arrangement as well as the panel
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be that when they are planning
these sites, the developers spec out
[SPEAKER_01]: really poor performing panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's skewing the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, since these sites don't
actually exist yet, we're least confident
[SPEAKER_01]: in these results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably the main driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, you had a question too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how do the mineral soil groups map
onto the CERGO classification stuff as one
[SPEAKER_04]: through four, like alpha soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did dig a little bit into that a while
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mainly, it's just a big chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they take every single soil group and
map it to a specific mineral soil group
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was developed in SCS by
agronomists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's based on yield potential for
maize.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the short answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So multiple soil types and every soil type
is ranked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the basis is yield potential for
maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's kind of similar to a New
York state-specific version of the NCCPI,
[SPEAKER_01]: except one being better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this first half of the analysis,
we found pretty good correlations between
[SPEAKER_01]: land covariates and existing solar sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to see if we could take
that and extrapolate into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, we needed to
answer a few questions, such as how much
[SPEAKER_01]: solar are we actually going to need,
how much area that would take up,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the land use trends that we're
currently seeing would look like if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're allowed to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're modelers and we're making
up scenarios anyway, we decided,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, let's get a little bit more
imaginative and see what happens if we
[SPEAKER_01]: start to tweak some parameters of that and
change what the future outcome could look
[SPEAKER_01]: like, just to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting to that first question,
how much solar are we actually going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need?
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of New York, with their handy
analysis that accompanied the CLCPA,
[SPEAKER_01]: they gave us some benchmarks of what they
expect we will need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this graph is showing annual
generation in gigawatt hours on the
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical axis and year on the horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're estimating that we will need
about 95 terawatt hours per year of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: to be generated from these utility scale
solar sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also estimate that that's going
to come from about 65 gigawatts of solar
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there's that difference between
energy and capacity, with terawatt hours
[SPEAKER_01]: being a quantity of energy and 65
gigawatts being capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we found that based on
real-world performance of solar sites in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State, that it is going to take
substantially more solar capacity to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that goal of 95 terawatt hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that it's going to be around 86
gigawatts of single-axis tracked sites or
[SPEAKER_01]: 96 gigawatts of fixed-axis sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to kind of give you a breakdown
of the different capabilities and capacity
[SPEAKER_01]: factors used in these models, the CLCPA
used a value of 22%, which is a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good day in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: NYSERDA, which is the New York State
Energy Research and Development Authority,
[SPEAKER_01]: they use in their models values of 16% for
single-axis tracked and around 13% for
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed-axis sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot closer to what we found when
we dug into the actual hour-by-hour
[SPEAKER_01]: production values of solar sites in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we downloaded all that raw data for
about 340 sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separated it into single and
fixed-axis, and we looked at what those
[SPEAKER_01]: actual power outputs were year over year
in relation to what their capacity is and
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single-axis sites have a capacity factor
of around 13.2, and fixed-axis are closer
[SPEAKER_01]: to 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, quite a bit lower than
the optimistic values used by the CLCPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these capacity factor values were able
to give us this range of total capacities
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've gone over, we have power
densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take the capacity and the power
density, you should be able to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to go a little bit further
and see if there are trends over time that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can tease out and apply, because 2050
is still a good ways in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of time for technology to
evolve and improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't think it's realistic to
just assume that power density is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to see if there are trends that
we can fit to demonstrate that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a scatter plot of power
densities of different sites based on when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, blue is representing
single-axis tract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red is representing fixed-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that there is a very
slight positive trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very strong trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a ton of great confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can use that to give us a little
bit of a better understanding of what
[SPEAKER_01]: sites could look like in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we vary that trend over time,
and we also vary the starting point of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the power density is now,
because there's also a substantial amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of variation in that data, and simulate
that thousands and thousands of times,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do something called a Monte Carlo
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this graph here represents the
probability of different areas of solar in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future, where the horizontal axis is
total land converted to solar,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the vertical axis is the probability
density, or how many of those simulations
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up at a specific inclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this represents a stochastic range
of values with single-axis tract sites
[SPEAKER_01]: having the lowest, most probable area
value, and fixed-axis sites having the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, fixed-axis sites are most
probable to occupy about 100,000 hectares
[SPEAKER_01]: of land in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: A substantial quantity of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large sites, they have a bit of a wider
distribution of spread, but they're right
[SPEAKER_01]: around 90,000 hectares of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason, if you saw in the first
graph that large sites are performing
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly, and now all of a sudden they're
doing better than fixed-axis, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: because the technology in most large sites
is single-axis tract, and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: improving faster than the fixed-axis in
terms of power density over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could have just simulated a massive
square of solar, plopped it in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York State, tallied up all the area
underneath it and called it day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we wanted to figure out if we could
get a little bit more specific about where
[SPEAKER_01]: these sites are going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did something called geospatial
analysis, where we took covariates that we
[SPEAKER_01]: knew played some role in site development,
and we took training data, which was all
[SPEAKER_01]: the sites that our AI model found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we created a probability raster of
where solar would exist in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used something called a maximum entropy
model, or MAXENT model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very similar to a random forest
model, if you're familiar with those,
[SPEAKER_01]: except it doesn't require negative
training data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can confidently say there is a solar
site here, but we can't say there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely never going to be a solar site
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to get over that little
hiccup, we used this particular model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up with a probability raster for
the entire state of New York, where 100
[SPEAKER_01]: represents prime solar development area,
and zero represents almost no chance of a
[SPEAKER_01]: solar site being developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this figure here, we can see
existing sites are sitting comfortably in
[SPEAKER_01]: the green areas as they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: We conducted the same land cover analysis
as we did for the existing sites on these
[SPEAKER_01]: polygons once we allocated enough of that
optimal land for meeting that total area
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement that we calculated with the
Monte Carlo analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that the distribution of land
cover types looks pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the present, we're looking at a lot of
annual row crops, hay, and pasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't really change much for the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to press the scales a little
bit, see if we could change the future
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario to look a little bit more
ag-responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we created a scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we created many scenarios,
but the one I'm going to talk about is
[SPEAKER_01]: where we took mineral soil groups one
through four and annual row crop land
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the CDL, the crop data layer,
and decreased their scores on that
[SPEAKER_01]: probability surface raster, and then ran
that same simulation again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to see that pasture land
becomes much more dominant of that land
[SPEAKER_01]: cover mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take away high-quality soils,
actively tilled agricultural land used for
[SPEAKER_01]: annual crops, but still keep in all those
covariates of distance of transmission
[SPEAKER_01]: lines, low slopes, et cetera, you can
start to see that there is still decent
[SPEAKER_01]: land available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are our key findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running a little low on time,
so I will not bore you with reading all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, we were able to locate
all existing sites across New York State,
[SPEAKER_01]: begin to understand what their former land
use characteristics were, and ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: try to see if there is a way that we could
take those sites, learn from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and project out into the future what the
state is going to look like when there are
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 gigawatt hours of solar across the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, 100 gigawatts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found that these sites are using
substantial agricultural land,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that to meet these state energy
targets, we are going to need a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural land to be converted to solar
unless restrictions are imposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have further questions that we
hope to find out the answers to at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: What land is consumed outside of solar
sites?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's land that's, sorry, it's called,
stranded land, land between a forest and a
[SPEAKER_01]: solar fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be available for
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a lot of uncertainty in how
much solar energy we'll need because we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: need a lot of energy in the winter when
solar panels are not producing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also are curious to see if
agricultural intensification can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: work from the other side to reduce some of
that potential food energy competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This project would not have been possible
without Peter's continual help and support
[SPEAKER_01]: and strategy planning and kind of keeping
me on track, as well as a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: manuscript editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Miller also helped with editing
manuscripts and was helpful in kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out the more nuanced issues with
my analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also Jennifer Whiteman provided
feedback and manuscript editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in doing like a spatial analysis of
how much land is available in certain
[SPEAKER_04]: regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've heard a lot of people from
Eastern New York, Albany region,
[SPEAKER_04]: very progressive people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really worried because their small
band alpha salt is being eaten up by
[SPEAKER_04]: solar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is different than Western New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Fulton, Montgomery County,
a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we weren't able to incorporate kind
of like attitude towards solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can say anecdotally that the
Albany area is developing very rapidly in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of solar growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think, driven primarily by
access to both the North-South running
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission lines and kind of the
East-West transmission lines that follow
[SPEAKER_01]: I-90.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regional analysis of what land is
available both for solar and what land is
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable for agriculture is certainly
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not something that we
specifically looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you considered doing an analysis that
looks at where the abandoned agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: land is and tries to root a potential
additional transmission line to open up
[SPEAKER_00]: access to abandoned land so that all that
pressure isn't right there on the nice oil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Lake Plain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, we're already experiencing grid
congestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like we're going to have to build
a lot more transmission lines if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to reach these goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So optimizing where those run in order to
maximize solar production while minimizing
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural land loss is a really good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody should do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the kind of expertise I have
in terms of land permitting or NIMBYism
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the things that go into deciding
where a transmission line goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did look a little bit at where planned
lines are being run or at least are
[SPEAKER_01]: planned to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that they're either running
down the bottom of the Hudson River or on
[SPEAKER_01]: existing corridors of existing
transmission lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a huge desire to branch out
into new territory and run completely new
[SPEAKER_01]: routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just chime in on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're intensely interested in this
former ag land and have been for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time because it's an unusual resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most places don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we have no geological
spatial data about where these are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done calculations for a long time
by difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cropland data layer says there's
this much ag land.
[SPEAKER_02]: The statistical surveys say there's a
smaller amount of ag land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think most of that difference is
former ag land.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we don't know where it is
geospatially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big missing data set for all
kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a question on Zoom as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering what you think of the
argument that instead of taking up
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable ag land with solar, solar is
protecting farmland from housing
[SPEAKER_01]: development that would make it permanently
non-ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's kind of an area that we
didn't delve too deeply into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, solar has a long lifespan
during which there's little or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially reduced capacity for
agriculture, whereas a housing
[SPEAKER_01]: development, there's really no crops that
can be produced in perpetuity other than
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's the question of,
are we really going to remove these solar
[SPEAKER_01]: sites in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to need energy
indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know necessarily if solar is a
less permanent land use, although I will
[SPEAKER_01]: say that it certainly has the potential to
be less impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be housing soil-enriching forages,
or it can be grassland bird habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does have more ecological value
than housing development, but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: say necessarily that it can be considered
less permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Louis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, the first one is more the macro
scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any spatial trend where you would
have more solar plants closer to cities,
[SPEAKER_03]: or as soon as you reach the grid,
then it doesn't matter where you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two things we looked into with that
are existing sites are less prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are a fair number on Long
Island, but they are just less prevalent
[SPEAKER_01]: as you get further south just because the
land value goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And $1,000 an acre in rent doesn't really
entice as many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, a lot of our future
analysis was informed by grid
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnection capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the New York State electrical grid is
divided up into these zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those zones have a rating of how much
electricity they can transmit from one
[SPEAKER_01]: zone to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially, because the grid is a
giant funnel, taking electricity down to
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City, the further south you get,
the less additional capacity there is to
[SPEAKER_01]: go from zone to zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of restricted the amount of
solar that we expect to be in the southern
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would most likely be away from those
big centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised to see going from
forest to solar, like how far back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: old way it would have forested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they cut the forest and then put
solar right away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anecdotally, I've seen that in
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it seems like that's a pretty common
transition just from the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling it's not the most
desirable scenario, just because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't think they're
looking at it at an altruistic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that does seem to happen a fair
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Zoom about brownfields and rooftop
solar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did not look at rooftop solar
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is about half of all solar capacity
at the time that we started this analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: was rooftop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a substantial amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, we've not only seen solar
being developed on a lot of brownfields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also primarily selected by our future
prediction models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that is certainly an option,
although it seems to be rapidly filling
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think unless there are any other
questions, I'll let you guys go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
