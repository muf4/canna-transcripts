[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my talk will be focused on genetic
architecture of cyanide in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, most plant species liberate
hydrogen cyanide from cyanogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: glucoside, and this process is known as
cyanogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So linamarine and lotosraline are the two
variants of cyanogenic glucoside in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava, and these are bioactive stable
plant secondary metabolites that provide
[SPEAKER_00]: effective defense against herbivores for
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, over the years, they have also taken
up or rather evolved to take up additional
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility of providing plant
plasticity and also specifically in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava, cyanogenic glucoside is
synthesized in the leaf and transported to
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, and usually are partitioned
between the peel of cassava and the
[SPEAKER_00]: parenchyma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at specifically cassava with
respect to cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cassava, as we all know, cassava is
an important economic and subsistence
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, and it produced efficiently under
optimal condition, and among many
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that cassava as a crop has or
as a staple is that it has a high
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanogenic glucoside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, our colleagues have
worked on the biosynthesis pathway for
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanogenic glucoside in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing to take note of is that
HCN, which is an acid trait of cyanide in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava, is a major domestication trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within cassava breeding program and
also food products, they usually use a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple diagnostic test, which is called
PICRETE test to assay for cyanide in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava, and it contains 10 sheets of
color chart ranging from yellow to brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they represent cyanide content in
cassava in milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specifically, cassava is kind of
categorized into two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the sweet cassava and the bitter
cassava, and this sweet and bitter cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: are also seen as those having low cyanide
and high cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to consume cassava, especially in
South-Saharan Africa, there are a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of traditional methods of detoxifying
cassava or cyanide to get it to a level
[SPEAKER_00]: that is safe for consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: World health recommendation is 10 ppm,
but some countries are even recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this list is not specific to any
country, but this is what is practiced
[SPEAKER_00]: across South-Saharan Africa to reduce the
cyanide of cassava before consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a picture of a woman that is
roasting cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you grate along with
pressing and roasting, but in addition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also soak or sun-dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wet or heat fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, any of these processes would
ordinarily, if followed strictly,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce cyanide content of cassava,
but oftentimes, they don't follow it that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyanide poisoning still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be in the extreme case in
most cases, but you can see how those
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with respect to how cassava is an
important staple in South-Saharan Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at what production of cassava,
you will see that over 50% of that
[SPEAKER_00]: production is coming from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this ensures that we have to kind of
tackle the challenges that are associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with cyanide in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those challenges is cyanide
intoxication, and this happens usually
[SPEAKER_00]: during agricultural crisis, and happens
mostly within the region of where you find
[SPEAKER_00]: poorest, you know, the poor people living
in rural area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that during this
agricultural crisis, they consume a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava, consistent on daily basis,
without successfully detoxifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this leads to cyanide intoxication
based on individual susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this cyanide intoxication is called
Konzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neurological disease that is
irreversible and causes permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: paralysis of the lower limb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first reported about eight decades
ago, for example, in Congo DR in 2002,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 100,000 cases was reported,
and I show the blood feature that depicts
[SPEAKER_00]: the severity of this Konzo disease,
and now you can see in the severe case,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up being permanently paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's been reported in a couple of
countries within South-Saharan Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most recent is in Zambia, between 2012
and 2015, about 40 cases have been
[SPEAKER_00]: reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at this from the perspective
of future projection, you will see that
[SPEAKER_00]: World Food Program, a prediction of food
insecurity as a result of climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to hit most in Africa,
and that means there will be reduced yield
[SPEAKER_00]: of generally crop yield, and that means
people would, you know, depend more on a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop like cassava for subsistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in view of this, what I try to do in
this study is to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture and map the chain from
breeding perspective, more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a tool or a diagnostic that
breeders can use to breed for the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this study, we're kind of
collaborating with Embra, a cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program in Brazil, and we have
access to over 3,500 land races and modern
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding lines coming from, you know,
the 26 states of Brazil, and we have six
[SPEAKER_00]: trials that were done in 2016,
2017, 2018, and 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we came up with a schema for
analysis, both to preserve the genotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: data, as well as do our phenotypic
analysis, and use Mismana to do a GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we looked at the phenotypic
distribution, and also estimated variance
[SPEAKER_00]: component, as well as irritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing to take home here is that
for this data set, that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: from Brazil, the irritability is high,
and it tells us that this trait would have
[SPEAKER_00]: high response to selection in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we did GWAS, and this was the result
we got for the GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two peaks, one in chromosome 14 and
one in chromosome 16, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining the regulation, the variance
that we see in our data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it says, to say that the Hessian
in this data set is regulated in an
[SPEAKER_00]: oligogenic manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, going forward, we looked at the marker
effect of our candidate markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or candidate SNPs, both for chromosome 14
and chromosome 16, and that of chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 shows additive response, while that of
chromosome 16 shows dominant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, listed below is the number of
individuals in each of the genotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, looking at the responses,
it is safe to say that that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: trait can be bred using a simple breeding
strategy within the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also estimated variance explained across
the genome, but across also subgenomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, chromosome 16 explained 50
percent of variance in our data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: while candidates nipping chromosome 16
explained 30 percent of the variation in
[SPEAKER_00]: our data set for HCN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going forward, we went back to
literature to check since the biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway for this progenogenic glucoside
has been reported in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we looked at the schematic,
just to present the schematic diagram of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biosynthesis gene cluster,
and the arrow is showing the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and their direction is showing the
orientation of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done in Cassava draft genome,
version four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we took those genes and we mapped them
to version six of Cassava genome that is
[SPEAKER_00]: used to process our genotyping data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we saw that those gene clusters are
actually in chromosome 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, not in any of those regions that we
found peaks for HCN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we did genome-wide epistasis
interaction and we actually did about 400
[SPEAKER_00]: million tests across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we found no interchromosomal
interaction across the genome for this
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just some takeaways so far for the
things I've shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown that our phenotypic
irritability and that our genotypic of
[SPEAKER_00]: this data set is 0.74 and 0.41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the regulation is responding in
an oligogenic manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two peaks, one in chromosome
14, one in chromosome 16, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining 16% and 50% of variation
respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosome 14 shows a big pattern and
explains 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wide data of 16 shows a dominant pattern
and explains 30% of genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also, we have no evidence based on
this data set for epistasis interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, we did a couple of
complementary analysis to map the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that is responsible for the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a summary table
specifically in the column where I have
[SPEAKER_00]: the high LD interval for chromosome 16,
we have six genes, wide for chromosome 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have three genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our candidate gene based on optimal
p-value and mutation prediction is a
[SPEAKER_00]: transphoton 16 and an epist protein in 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this candidate SNPs are found within
the coding region of those candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I had initially described a situation
in Africa, but we started with Brazilian
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is that Kusaba originated
from Brazil and was also domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was transferred to Africa, but there
were additional improvement that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: that changed the genome landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was learned from Brazil and
then applied that knowledge to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to Kusaba base and found lots of
trial, about 393 trials that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: across 23 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use it for GWAS for this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We view the genetic distribution and
estimated the variance as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we observe in this case is
that the genetic variance is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the GWAS analysis, we also found
two peaks, one in 14 and one in 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you align it with the previous data set
coming from Brazil, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're properly aligned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's safe to say that at least based on
this data set, the genetic architecture
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did joint GWAS analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found the same peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in this case, the candidate SNPs
are well separated from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also aligned it with the previous
two results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aligned properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize the results of this
data set, we saw that the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability varies across the two data
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And HCN is conserved in both data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: HCN is regulated in an oligogenic manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found no evidence based on this data
set that there is epistasis interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since we didn't find any peak in
chromosome 12, where we found those gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, we tend to speculate that
perhaps domestication of cassava targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream or downstream genetic regulation
steps of HCN biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the deliverables is to develop
this type of markers that is available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the community for breeders to use as
breeding diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next steps will be to do functional
characterization, knockout, validation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the diagnostic markers in Africa,
as well as expression studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the long term, we want to look at
the impact of climate change and cyanide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also to develop materials that can be
deployed to this cyanide intoxication
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspot in South South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it couldn't have been possible
without a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, I want to thank my
comments to Lucas, Kelly, Susan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Janice, but also the breeding program
in Brazil led by Edda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also our collaborators in Africa,
Ismael Rabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're validating the marker sets we
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to appreciate Miguel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the lab to functionally
validate our findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to appreciate folks in Mueller lab,
especially Guillaume, who was always
[SPEAKER_00]: available to answer my question and
supported me in this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denise, initially, when he was still at
Cornell, often time I asked him such a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool question, and he was generous to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank VCI, Cornell Pads,
and Plan Breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Alex.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll have a bit of time for a
couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed Buckler says, nice thoughts,
Alex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the VWAS peaks overlap with diversity
sweep seen in the HapMap?
[SPEAKER_03]: And does the biosynthetic cluster on
chromosome 12 have little diversity,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to HapMap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get the question correctly,
so we might put mutation alleles within
[SPEAKER_00]: the HapMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need a whole genome in
mutation using the HapMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: HapMap has a reference for that particular
chromosome 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found the same region and the same
sneak as our candidate sneak, if that
[SPEAKER_00]: answers the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kristen asks, thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a sense for how decreasing
cyanide content may impact pest resistance
[SPEAKER_03]: and therefore potentially yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this question always comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look at this specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I try to do here is to understand
the genetic architecture and to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge or information would be used for
that to do specific studies and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: does affect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen about one or two studies that
were done previously in ITA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't show that that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is open for further studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with respect to this, I'm just looking
at the architecture of cyanide.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll move on to our third speaker
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
