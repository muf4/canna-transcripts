[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, Pam, aren't we all grateful for
this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely outkicked his coverage,
marrying Sally and having these two
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scary time for Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for everybody for keeping us
updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, what a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making the local news.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a thing, Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen him?
[SPEAKER_02]: We FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least three times a week, we FaceTime
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: He FaceTimed me when he first got out and
he had a beard, just to show me his beard
[SPEAKER_02]: before shaving it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything had helped this ugly mug.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back to work on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he wants to go back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to go back to being global turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on a ventilator for 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Carl it's about hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're so glad that you are giving us
play-by-play activities of your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they were actively reading
the pool instructions while you were
[SPEAKER_00]: lamenting the trampoline killing the
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian Winka confirmed that,
yes, the trampoline will, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: kill the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kobe Schmucker upped you guys,
went all in on the trampolines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five hammocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hillbilly social distancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining a sense of humor, Pam,
is really very important during these
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, to help the grounds folks,
the sports folks, along these lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: the STMA has just done a spectacular job
in providing resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these that we talked about last
week is one I'll highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple more that we'll get to as
we go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a quick recap of the weather
before we get to the northeastern part of
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get to a conversation about
sports turf management.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us in the northeast,
you can see we remain well behind normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is going to change dramatically
over the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the warmth will come copious
amounts of rainfall for us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arti Gaetano, our climate specialist at
the Northeast Climate Center, was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to us about a rain event that precedes a
tropical storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're going to be
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not as worried about the tropical
storm, but it could be large swaths of
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere from two to three to four inches
throughout the northeastern US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the temperatures will begin to
warm, and we will start to see some change
[SPEAKER_00]: to this, they're really not going to be
much more than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll remain behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of degree days will accumulate,
base 50 degree days, indicating the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of time above average temperature is above
50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see some improvement,
but not a huge dramatic shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some temperatures in the 80s
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you started to plan your things at
the end of March and early April in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast, you saw back in April that soil
temperatures were already creeping into
[SPEAKER_00]: the low to mid 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A month later, again, it looked like it
was surging on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't moved that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of recently, we still aren't very
much further ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slow to come along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, where Pam is out in Ohio,
it's much further ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly down in southern Ohio has got to
be a little bit further ahead than we are
[SPEAKER_00]: up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see soil temperatures are
really not driving things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to me, one of the fascinating things
about this is that there needs to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me see, did I get this in the right
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got this in the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam did a wonderful job with the team
there, Ohio State, the Ohio Sports Turf
[SPEAKER_00]: Managers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away out of the gate, because of
course the growing season is enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: further ahead than it is here,
right away you've got these top 10
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance practices to focus on,
particularly as we were confronting,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not being able to access the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now more recently, the STMA has of course
responded to this and a recent publication
[SPEAKER_00]: came out, Healing Through Sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was really good sort of
compiling things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our colleague, Pam and I's colleague,
Grady Miller at NC State was asked this
[SPEAKER_00]: question because apparently there were
people in the sports turf world who all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden couldn't access their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, this is a Bermuda grass
field, but the question to Grady that Pam
[SPEAKER_00]: is also a columnist in the Sports Turf
Magazine answering questions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, well, what do I do if I
can't get there for months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I put just a simple answer up here
because with Bermuda grass, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to take a few weeks to
get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get it at the right time when
Bermuda grass can sort of rejuvenate and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow after a scalping, you're likely in
good stead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cool season turf abandoned to some
degree like this, even sports fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the fields starting to grow now in
the southern part of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the infield skin beginning to
get weedy when you're not allowed access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously recovering these things are
going to take enormous amounts of labor
[SPEAKER_00]: and care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, one of the things
everybody's going to tell you is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if your fields went into this,
they'll come out of it pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully with just some minimal
maintenance, they'll come out of it pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been pretty, a pretty
consistent message that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pam, you wrote this really great
article recently about thresholds for
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable weed cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this a little bit last
week with Sorakan, but what I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights to me are a couple of tools I
want to talk to you about with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea of, you know, going out,
looking at your fields, getting a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: how they perform and using tools to
communicate that to the people that we
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the STMA, Excel spreadsheets,
playing condition index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is your report card for rating
athletic fields, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify sort of how we do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our really simple sports turf
rating system that we have on our sports
[SPEAKER_00]: turf site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not partial to any one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, sitting down at a
conference or listening to this and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, okay, well, I can see how to use
this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really I have to say, Pam,
this is the question I have for us to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about today is, I've been alarmed at the
amount of people that are struggling with
[SPEAKER_00]: just being able to do essential
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not able to justify even accessing
their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you seeing much of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing much field abandonment,
people not realizing what they have to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing it at all different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a friend who manages a
professional baseball field and he doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any fungicide and there's been a lock
on buying anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's his problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have, you know, local school
district and local park and rec
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, the grass is six, eight inches
tall, infield starting to get weedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My local school district, I've noticed
they have come out and they've mowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it, to try and keep it somewhat
manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think there'll be,
it's at all levels, at all levels and at
[SPEAKER_02]: all different types of sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it have anything to do with us
not being able to talk to people about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it, they just shut it down and they
didn't want to hear from anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably the latter mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Budget freezes, hiring freezes,
interns let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those decisions were made very quickly by
administration without the input,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from a lot of field managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with it just being an
unprecedented time, those decisions were
[SPEAKER_02]: made really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we begin to reopen up, do you see a
role for going out and assessing the
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people are going to say,
listen, we're not playing sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we, you think these tools will be
useful in helping people communicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we have to do up the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we have to concentrate on
the big three.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have to say, look,
we've got to do mowing, we've got to mow,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got to control weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then depending on your situation,
it might be disease control or insect
[SPEAKER_02]: control or irrigation or fertilizer,
whatever it is for your particular
[SPEAKER_02]: instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you need to, rather than try
and do everything, just concentrate on the
[SPEAKER_02]: one or two or three of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been what you've developed to
guide these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it your sense that guys have been
able to do these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying there's a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously losing ground on Bermuda grass
at this time of the year might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: be made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the cool season guys that are
coming back to six inch turf?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we're trying to get the
message across that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mowing is a stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we mow so much, we have to do
the other things, you know, irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer, pest control.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're not mowing, it's not under as
much stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also back off those other
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think just having a mowing plan and
being able to communicate that mowing plan
[SPEAKER_02]: will be key.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the cool season grass isn't
going to die if it gets to be eight inches
[SPEAKER_02]: tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just got to have a really good plan
to bring it back to your original height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether that, you know, using rotary
mowers, maybe even taking clippings off so
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't have, you know,
tons of clippings on the field,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe work with some volunteers,
try and help you mow more frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't see, unless we've got
sports on these fields, I don't see the
[SPEAKER_02]: staff levels coming back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another issue is manpower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There just isn't the people to do the
mowing because they've cut seasonal staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seasonal staff is where the loss is
going to get hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as an aside, I know you're active in
the scouts and I know that STMA did this
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice thing with scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Nicole with the Orioles is
doing some STEM stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is happening to try to
connect the youth to this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this as a really opportune
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you're, you know,
you're doing it at home with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it with the scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a really opportune time when our
staffing levels are low to use that time
[SPEAKER_00]: to get people involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, communities have sports
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to use them to help get
back and do things safely if we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you, what are you seeing about
the connection between this brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasm around this as an, you know,
a STEM area of study and the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to help us moving forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's been a wake up call for us
all in academia that our student levels
[SPEAKER_02]: are down in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to look at all different
ways, all innovative ways that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: connect with youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's through scouts or STEM videos
or going into schools or going to FFA
[SPEAKER_02]: events.
[SPEAKER_02]: FFA, FFA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 4-H.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what Nicole's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of people doing the same
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't know we exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to keep getting the message
out there that this is an industry that
[SPEAKER_02]: exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm teaching a plant science merit
badge to a hundred scouts right now across
[SPEAKER_02]: the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six o'clock every night this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come on and we zoom and there's a,
there's a section in the plant science
[SPEAKER_02]: book about careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to, they have to look at plant
science careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turf grass isn't even mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant science merit badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a, you know, the fact,
I mean, I years ago here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: we used to have to do marketing just to
teach kids what plant science was that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually study plants and nevermind
at the specialized level we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, it seems so obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us work at schools, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a wake up for academia,
but, but at the same time students in high
[SPEAKER_00]: schools, you know, getting them involved
at, at that age is going to help build
[SPEAKER_00]: this later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but we have to reconcile that with as
soon as times get tight at various places,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're at the highest level,
it's a very different industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one per, I mean, how many
people at these facilities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened at the U, what's happened
at the U where you are at the Ohio state,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening to the sports fields
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being maintained still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brian Gimble and the crew are
staggering times coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still being maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've, and synthetic and natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got synthetic in the stadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had it in there since 2007,
I believe.
We've had a lot of synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baseball, varsity baseball, synthetic,
and rugby synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a lot of synthetic turf,
all infilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's not, is he, so one of the
things that happens is the municipalities,
[SPEAKER_00]: the school districts, the lower level
things have fewer resources, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where a lot of the jobs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're having a hard time
getting those people to value the
[SPEAKER_00]: professionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see in your report card,
one of the questions you ask is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a certified sports field
manager?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that isn't prominent
enough in our industry to demonstrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: professionalism you need to manage these
fields at a high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it comes down to the type of
people who are in the industry are
[SPEAKER_02]: typically hardworking, humble people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That don't like to, you know, toot their
own horn, whatever you want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to put a suit on, look smart,
talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we went to the women's
forum, STMA years ago, we looked at the
[SPEAKER_02]: lady who wrote the, she was the CEO of
Facebook and we were given a copy of her
[SPEAKER_02]: book each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she says, sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're invited to a meeting,
sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep telling sports turf managers
this, if you're invited to that meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you go in that room and you sit at the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't sit on the edge and keep quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a voice, you know, sit at the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found that these field assessment
tools help bridge that gap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data is power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data is power.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can go and you can say,
look, we've gone from 30% weed cover to
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% weed cover during this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Numbers tell the entire story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that last week with
Soraka and as weed populations increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: the traffic tolerance is not going to be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, I know you mentioned in
your article about micro clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a funny pun, but we don't want clover
on sports fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the issue with it is the big
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was listening to Paige Boyle's
webinar last night and I know she's on
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges with it is that you
can't control other weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got micro clover in your,
in your mix, how do we, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that needs addressing, um, the wear
tolerance of it, the mowing quality of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a 10% probably it wouldn't,
you know, what percentage is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage and how do we control other
weeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of the challenges with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you know, clover is not one that
plays nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts out sort of interspersed and
then it gets clumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and one of the things we've talked
about consistently in these webinars with
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase and with everybody else is the,
you know, when an athlete plants their
[SPEAKER_00]: foot, if one spot is markedly different
from another spot, they're either,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they don't sense it, there's a higher
likelihood for injury in those,
[SPEAKER_00]: in those situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that gets clumpy and weeds are
one of those things that maybe not,
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be as obvious could then lead to
problems with safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me transition to safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pounding on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of people talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gosh, Pam, no one's got a clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like no one's taken this data at
the various levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is one of the ways we're
going to be able to have some success in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting these fields looked at as an
aspect of school or player safety?
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably come through some kind
of, um, legislation or being forced to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think usually this, it doesn't,
it doesn't happen until we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, in, in Columbus public
schools, we've got 17 high schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot of schools to get
tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of, you know, that's a lot of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't have the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only budget item they have,
the only line item they have for sports
[SPEAKER_02]: turf management at our district is mowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else, just mowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, how do we get the message across
that it's important?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll come through legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone will get injured and it'll be
something we have to do to keep these
[SPEAKER_02]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that led to the preponderance of more
synthetic turf in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that I need more people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow if I get synthetic turf,
I don't have to, you know, quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's no maintenance sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, as professionals,
you know, I'm speaking as devil advocate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wonder if that's not the logic that
they use to get synthetic turf as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need less guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to stress about it where we
don't need to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to, it's something we can,
we can build and walk away from and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody can sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the, that's the
misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when you talk about 17 high
schools in Columbus, Ohio, and I know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel about football and sports in
Columbus, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the fact that all they budget for is
mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must have a fair amount of synthetic
fields on those, on those campuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't know because they have to
all be treated the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they install one, they have to
install 60 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what is the, well, that's that,
you know, and, and every time that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge capital expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the argument for the,
you know, the long-term investment you
[SPEAKER_00]: make in a natural grass field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm an advocate of having a synthetic
field to flex to when the weather's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, you know, the lacrosse team
wants to get out there and it's snowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in our neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it as a flex field, but not as a
routine field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put a lot of traffic on sports
turf, even sand based fields, Pam,
[SPEAKER_00]: practice fields are going to get worn out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a certain level of wear
that you can put on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the balances, you know,
as a sports turf person, but also as a
[SPEAKER_02]: parent, I don't want my kid playing on
something that's 150 degrees in June,
[SPEAKER_02]: July and August.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't want my kid breathing in
whatever's coming off those crumb rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the science is not the EPA
is released, whatever they released and
[SPEAKER_02]: the science isn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a parent, I have those concerns and
they get hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there is maintenance to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not maintenance free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the long haul, are they economic,
economically sound for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if my local high school puts it in and it
costs them over a month, a million and the
[SPEAKER_02]: only last eight years, you know,
they need to start looking at the numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more than they do,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's partly because of what
we're experiencing that somehow natural
[SPEAKER_00]: grass has challenges that are alleviated
by getting the synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bring up an interesting point and
you know, you wonder as the role you sit
[SPEAKER_00]: in both as a parent and as a leader in
the, in the sports turf world,
[SPEAKER_00]: do, how would you like to be approached by
sports turf managers as a parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you think even parents notice
the quality of some of these fields their
[SPEAKER_00]: kids play on or just like, okay,
go play, leave me alone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they notice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't notice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I stand on the sidelines and I
grumble about, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields my kids play on, it's a hundred
percent prostrate knotweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by October it's completely brown and
they're playing on bare dirt and knotweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not a consideration until I
say something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, oh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, they don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, we got some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, there's a good one from
Brian here and it touches on a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: things we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually a baseball coach,
a high school in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said the maintenance people who cut
the fields there are really more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: general maintenance person.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says they're electricians, auto
mechanics by trade and coming out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, it looked like they were like they
went from, they had about seven inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky bluegrass and they just kind of
scalped it right down to an inch and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now he's got a situation where,
you know, maybe it's just coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wondering what kind of suggestions
you guys would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe another question is how
should he go about talking maybe to
[SPEAKER_01]: administration or the maintenance people
about the importance of managing a turf
[SPEAKER_01]: field and the stuff we've talked about
today via safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give that one to you,
Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think seven inches down to three
inches, that grass lost a lot of its leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is when you allow grass
to grow, it thins, you get fewer larger
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just respond differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, instead of going up as you lower
the mowing height, density will go back
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see a lot of just thin
turf for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of course is ripe and Illinois
for weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll pass it to Pam about it and
talk about safety of something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across this scenario before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with a volunteer group that
would come in once a week and mow an inch
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, it's not just about the
agronomy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how does, how do you relay that
message in a kind way to the ground staff?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to just educate them in a kind
way, in an open way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just try and educate them on the
mowing height that it should be and how we
[SPEAKER_02]: get there and the one third rule and the
fact that keep hammering that message home
[SPEAKER_02]: that mowing is a stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we stress it too much, which
they've done, they need to leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't vertical, don't aerate, don't spray
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may feed it a little, maybe make sure
it's irrigated if you're going to a hot
[SPEAKER_02]: dry period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in Illinois, you'll be, we're getting
really warm in Ohio now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be eighties, I think by
this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an irrigation system,
irrigate it, spoon feed it, leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially because I don't think are we,
I doubt we're playing baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're going to start playing
baseball soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I know that, I know golf is
gearing up to get going, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: heard anything beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another question, Carl,
before we start wrapping up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll just ask one along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Frank and I, I know you,
you and I have experienced this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, situations where the coach and
the managers of fields, maybe sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: butt heads, and we've kind of discussed
this on, you know, past webinars,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Pam, are there any techniques that you
can give a turf manager to try and diffuse
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe those, some of those situations
where a coach comes in and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe tries to tell them how to manage the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they feel differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, what's a good way to, to bridge that
with, with coaches and managers,
[SPEAKER_01]: turf managers?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an art form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's seminars that you can go
to about this managing conflict while
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got, if you've got some time on
your hands, I would recommend all sports
[SPEAKER_02]: managers look into, you know, leadership,
doing some lead, getting some leadership
[SPEAKER_02]: skills, managing conflict about listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you listen more than you speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience is those people don't know
what they don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times a coach will come in and,
and, and we have talked about this and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really, it was informative to me,
Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were dealing with some soccer coaches
here and we tried to get feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: One coach would be very detailed about the
kinds of aspects of the game that they
[SPEAKER_00]: felt the turf was involved in and the way
the ball behaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and was very clear about,
well, I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, rolling and watering and
top, you know, the things we know we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do to manipulate that surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was another coach who said,
you know, you got to mow it lower and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and put sand top dressing and then
it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one guy was telling me what they
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy was telling me what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to sort of, I'm from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything sounds sweeter when you say it,
Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As hard as I try, I still love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, what are you a dope?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so I think it's hard sometimes to
deal with these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the most important thing you
said is you got to like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: this person just needs to be massaged to
understand there's many ways to skin this
[SPEAKER_00]: cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only does an art form to
communicate, it's an art form to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions these people want
sometimes, nevermind field hockey on
[SPEAKER_00]: natural grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much you run into that,
but that, that's to be enormously
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because you've got to cut the
grass so low.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most field hockey fields I see at the rec
level here in Ohio are all per annua for
[SPEAKER_02]: that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it is an art form and you've got
to be the expert in the room and data,
[SPEAKER_02]: data, data, data, everything you say,
back it up with data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be the expert in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not, you know, that's,
that's back to the safety data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many guys have data on their hands on
a pretty regular basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got labor and they have their
budgetary things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, but the assessment of those
fields ought to be routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fear at even moderate levels,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily doing a condition
survey report like you'd have to do for a
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that simple data that there are
tools you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I just listed three of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make one up on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it helps you communicate what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that's the way we're going
to get these fields back when sports
[SPEAKER_00]: return when they return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I used to take my students to
visit a field manager who I really
[SPEAKER_02]: respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, also find out where the
money's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you can find out where the
money's coming from and you know how much
[SPEAKER_02]: you're bringing into that pot,
you can get a little bit of that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just about agronomic data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about you know, find out where the
money's coming from, um, find out how much
[SPEAKER_02]: of that you contribute and see if you can
get a little as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the side of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to end on the grabbing for the
money situation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam, thank you so much for taking the time
to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great to see you keep up the great
work with the scouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Carl, how about a survey Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent that link in the chat box for
everybody one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and again, thanks to Pam for hopping
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: with us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just a reminder, we're, we're going to
skip next week and then, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's thanksgiving us the OHIO here as a
sign off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be back at the 28th with our,
with our, um, next sports trip webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you so much for joining us.
