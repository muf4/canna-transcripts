[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're ready to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our speaker for this week is Dr. Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin Pritz, Professor and Chair of the
Department of Horticulture at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our topic is Soil Nutrient Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to discuss correction of soil
problems, application technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional nutrient sources,
organic nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's next week's topic,
liming and pH reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you know what we'll be studying
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin was born in southwestern
Pennsylvania and got his BS in biology
[SPEAKER_00]: from Bucknell and his MS in biology from
the University of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his PhD in horticulture at Michigan
State University working with wild species
[SPEAKER_00]: of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to Cornell in 1984 as the berry
crop specialist with an appointment in
[SPEAKER_00]: extension research and teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin works primarily with production and
pest management systems in strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: and raspberries, including food safety
issues and has consulted with berry
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became chairman of the Department of
Horticulture in July 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches career explorations in the
plant sciences, hands-on horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: berry crop production and management,
and leadership development for life
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kathy, and welcome all of you
to the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day here in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's nice for you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to do today is talk about how
to interpret soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil tests, as we mentioned before
in previous webinars, are used before
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we're primarily using our
soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of soil testing, just to
refresh, is to estimate the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-available nutrient levels in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil tests do not tell you how much of a
particular nutrient is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They estimate how much of a particular
nutrient in the soil is available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the extractant sort of mimics what a
plant root might have available to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you can't mimic that perfectly,
people who come up with these different
[SPEAKER_01]: extractants to try to imitate what a plant
root might be able to extract from the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those values are obtained,
then a recommendation is made to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: those levels up to some optimum because we
don't want soil nutrients to be limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, plants respond to soil
nutrients in a curve that sort of looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, you know, you get a rapid response
at low levels, but as you get up further
[SPEAKER_01]: in the curve, the response to more and
more nutrients begins to level out to
[SPEAKER_01]: where you don't get a response at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of soil nutrient testing is
to somewhat build up the soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: bank so that there's never a risk of
nutrients being limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some philosophies of soil
testing where you want to just apply
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to where the economic gain from an
additional amendment is equal to the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: of the added amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me maybe try to show you that
graphically.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some philosophies, you want to try to
be right here in the curve where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just starting to see a decrease in the
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other philosophies say, well, we want to
be up here because we don't ever want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in a situation where we want to be in a
deficient condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different soils labs sort of give you
recommendations based on that philosophy
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably not surprising but
surprisingly, soils labs that also sell
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers tend to be up here at the top
end and university labs and all tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit harder with perennial
crops to be in this range here where the
[SPEAKER_01]: green arrows point out because we don't
often have a chance to go back in annually
[SPEAKER_01]: and add a little bit of nutrient to bring
us up to where we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at recommendations for
annual crops, they'll often be down in
[SPEAKER_01]: this range with berry crops and perennial
crops, we tend to have to find a happy
[SPEAKER_01]: medium between here and up here because we
can't go in annually and replenish very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideal is somewhere between we just
can't go in and incorporate the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients we need after a year is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So except for sandy soils, the eventual
nutrient supply, which is how much is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil plus how much we add as
fertilizer, should be sufficient for the
[SPEAKER_01]: life expectancy of the planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would be looking at maybe five
years of strawberries, maybe 10 to 15 for
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries without having to come back in
and annually apply phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, magnesium, calcium and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, nitrogen, we do apply that
annually, but that's very soluble and it
[SPEAKER_01]: can get down into the root zone very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other nutrients, phosphorus in
particular, is very difficult to move
[SPEAKER_01]: through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to have that incorporated
before we plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have to maybe build up a
little bit of a bank, particularly for
[SPEAKER_01]: longer lived crops like raspberries and
particularly blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever these soil tests are done and
recommendations come out, every soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to give you a slightly
different response curve to the crop of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't develop response curves for
every soil type in your state,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we have to make some generalizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the truth of the matter is,
these response curves have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: developed for strawberries and raspberries
and blueberries on all different soil
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, the agronomists have done
these things for field crops, but not so
[SPEAKER_01]: much for food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the point here is that we're
making educated guesses about how berry
[SPEAKER_01]: crops respond, often based on the response
of some of these agronomic crops that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know a little bit more about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One approach that's often used is to find
an agronomic crop that has a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: response to a fruit crop, but where
there's a lot more data for, and use that
[SPEAKER_01]: as sort of a foundation for some of the
soil testing recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a good example would be alfalfa,
which tends to have the same sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: response to nutrients in the soil and soil
types as do strawberries and raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, alfalfa's a perennial,
strawberries and raspberries are
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have about the same rooting depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the same pH requirement for soil
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the same pH level for optimal
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are oftentimes used as a basis
for a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, people do nutrient response
curves for some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example actually from
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is looking at nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are looking at various rates of
nitrogen fertilizer on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in a liquid form, so it's not
quite easily to convert to pounds per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, at low nutrient levels,
you don't get much of a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you move up, you get a higher,
higher response.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the curve kind of flattens out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at leaf area, we fertilize with
more and more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the leaves love it, and they
really expand a lot and grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look at yield, it's not nearly
as responsive to the increases in
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that says, okay, the optimal rate is
probably somewhere around this 10 and
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the situation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do these response curves to some
extent and sort of calibrate our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: tests by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that they don't exist for
berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there's not a lot of those
out there to calibrate on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some recommendations are based on response
curves that are dependent on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: type.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, to get a good
recommendation, you have to input the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: type so that then the software knows what
soil type that is and can make a
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Morgan extractant is a good example of a
type of soil test that you have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil type, or at least know whether it's a
sandy loam or a loam or a silt or a clay
[SPEAKER_01]: because the response curve in the
extractant is based on that soil type you
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many labs are getting away from those
tests that are dependent on soil type and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at other tests that that's less
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the modified Morgan is one of those
tests that is a little bit less dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: on knowing the type of soil that you have
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of this is due to the amount of
potassium that the different extractants
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to sort of assume that the
soil tests that you're using, the
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures and all are good and accurate
and that the recommendations come out are
[SPEAKER_01]: on target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a question was asked like a week or
so ago about, organic versus conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommendations that come out should
be mostly the same whether one's organic
[SPEAKER_01]: or conventional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what's recommended that should be
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the amount and the type of product
that's used that's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a soil test might recommend,
you know, 50 pounds of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the source of that potassium is what
would differ them between the organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: the conventional grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some difference in amount based
on release rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some organic nutrients are a little bit
more slower to release their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you may have to apply more of that
because the release rate is slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, it's the total amount
would be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you get your soil test,
the most important adjustment that we
[SPEAKER_01]: usually make is to soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the soil pH isn't within the desired
range, then the ability to take up
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients will become compromised.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you don't have the pH right,
you can put on a lot of a certain nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: and it might not even get into the plant
because of the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably have all seen this in
soil classes back in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of nutrient that's
available to the plant is very dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: on soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the optimal range for most crops is a
little bit less than 6 up to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you all know blueberries are
the exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're down around 4.5 for the optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for most of the plants that we're
dealing with with the berries and even
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops, it's up around 6 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that range, most of the
nutrients are reasonably available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we have to make an adjustment to
the pH, we use sulfur to lower it and lime
[SPEAKER_01]: to raise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes in catalogs and particularly
for homeowners, you'll see a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum sulfate recommended to lower the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do not recommend that because
aluminum is toxic to plants at high rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, it provides a rapid change
in pH because the sulfur is already
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidized when it's in aluminum sulfate
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it could go right to work and lower
that pH almost right away, whereas sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: takes some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want all that aluminum,
so we don't recommend that for lowering
[SPEAKER_01]: pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And changing the soil pH after planting is
extremely slow and difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so important to do it
before planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of photos here of people
who have planted and then realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: their pH is too low and tried to raise it
with lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it just makes a real mess
in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to incorporate and get
that lime down into the root zone where it
[SPEAKER_01]: has an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you can mix it in the soil before
you plant, it just makes a world of
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry field, same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to work that lime down
into the soil well enough to really change
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH around the root zone where those
nutrients can be taken up better?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the amount of lime that you're going
to apply to the soil to change the pH is
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is the difference between the
current pH and your target pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how big is the gap between where you
want to be and where you currently are?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing is something
called the cation exchange capacity or the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ability of the soil to hold on
to the cations in the soil through these
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like negative charges on the soil
particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the ratio of the cations that are
bound to these negative charges to charges
[SPEAKER_01]: that only have hydrogen attached to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ratio of the cations to the
hydrogen ions to determine your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is often called base saturation or
the percent of the exchange sites occupied
[SPEAKER_01]: by the bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just think of it as like a column.
[SPEAKER_01]: The column has a lot of negative charges
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those charges then attach to
positively charged cations such as
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, magnesium, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the major ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remainder tend to be populated with
hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more hydrogen ions you have,
the lower your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, pH is the negative log of the
hydrogen ion content or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the higher the ratio of the
hydrogen ions to cations, the more acid
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the more of these exchange sites we
have, and if we want to change it and
[SPEAKER_01]: knock some of those hydrogens off the
exchange site, we have to add a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: The negative charges on our soils arise
from either clay particles or organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the sources of the negative
charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the clay particles and the organic
matter hold on to those positive charges
[SPEAKER_01]: that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils that have a lot of exchange
capacity, in other words, have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: negative charges, are more difficult to
adjust to pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you want to knock hydrogen ions off
that exchange site, you have to use a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you make that adjustment,
soils that are high in calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity tend to be more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a lot more resistant to change
once you make the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils that are low are easy to change,
but they'll revert back to a low pH as
[SPEAKER_01]: those calcium and magnesium and potassium
ions leach from the soil and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen takes over those exchange sites
and the pH drops again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to reiterate, it's easy to raise the
pH of a sandy soil with low organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: because sandy soils and low organic matter
soils have low carbon exchange capacities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, it's hard to lower the pH of a
clay soil having a high organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: content because both clay and organic
matter contribute to these negative
[SPEAKER_01]: charges in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the amount of sulfur, this is just
estimates, ballpark estimates,
[SPEAKER_01]: to lower the pH to a desired level of 4.5
depends on the two things we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the current pH, which is
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the further we are from
4.5, which is our target pH, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur it will take to lower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the higher our carbon exchange
capacity, the more sulfur it will take to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a sandy soil, not much loamy soil
with more negative charges, higher carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity, it takes more sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with clays, even more sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we're up in this range here,
with a high pH soil with heavy soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really, really hard to lower that pH
to 4.5, even with a lot of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oftentimes, soils up in here aren't
really suitable for blueberry production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, soil tests attempt to estimate the
amount of lime or sulfur required to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH to within the desired range for a
particular crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's based on this carbon exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil tests do not measure carbon exchange
capacity directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it doesn't go in and
directly measure the amount of negative
[SPEAKER_01]: charges in there and how many of those
negative charges are populated by hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use indirect methods to measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inexact science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different procedures are used in different
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the carbon exchange capacity itself
varies somewhat with pH and other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess what I'm trying to say here is
that oftentimes, the lime recommendations,
[SPEAKER_01]: we think of them as being really,
really precise, but the truth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: matter is, they're estimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to put you in a ballpark,
but they're not absolutely precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon exchange capacity varies with
various soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sands, of course, have low, and loams a
little bit higher, and clays have higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that reflected in the
sulfur recommendations in the previous
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humus, organic matter, in its sort of
broken down form, has very, very high
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why soils high in organic matter
require a lot of sulfur or lime to make
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to forget that adding
lime or sulfur to the soil does not change
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes six months or longer,
usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dependent on the size of the particle
of the lime and the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller particle sizes adjust more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In dry soils, you get very little,
very slow oxidation and conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have adequate soil moisture to
make sure it happens relatively quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: and in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wintertime, not much happens in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That process of oxidation is a biological
process that requires soil bacteria to
[SPEAKER_01]: make that conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's cold, there's not a lot of
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, those bacteria have to have
aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aerobic process, and the soil has
to be aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those things have to happen for
that pH to change after we add our lime or
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's get into the crux of the
matter here with that background,
[SPEAKER_01]: an interpreting soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at soil pH,
the macronutrients, the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to run through seven or
eight examples, and we'll work through
[SPEAKER_01]: those and see how a soil test might
interpret those and recommend those.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an example of a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at some of its various parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the reports that come back vary
a lot from lab to lab, but let's just
[SPEAKER_01]: assume this is sort of a general
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you want to look for,
at least I do, is the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to look and see whether that's
within the ballpark range or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case here, it's for
strawberries, the pH range that we use
[SPEAKER_01]: before we provide a lime recommendation is
between like 6 and 6.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pH is within that range,
so we wouldn't recommend lime here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll see a different pH number
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case here, there's this thing
called buffer pH in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people say, well, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean my pH is too low because
it's less than 6?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case here, this soil testing lab
is using something called the buffer pH to
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate cow and exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference between the buffer pH
and the normal pH in water is an estimate
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cow and exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's complicated curves and
correlations and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But suffice it to say that the greater the
difference between the pH and the buffer
[SPEAKER_01]: pH, the greater the cow and exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, the slower or harder it's going
to be to change that pH if you had to
[SPEAKER_01]: change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case here, we wouldn't have to
change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the situation where the buffer pH
differed greatly from the pH in water,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would imply a high cow and exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't worry about that for
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume that the software takes that
into account and spits out that lime or
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur recommendation based on that
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's often shown there so you can see
that it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you some sense of when you're
comparing different soils, what that cow
[SPEAKER_01]: and exchange capacity difference is if it
doesn't print it out directly on the form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some soil tests print it out directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one prints out that buffer pH to pH
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I like to look at is the
organic matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see organic matters 2% or
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's pretty good, 4.6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It indicates that the cow and exchange
capacity is reasonably robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's organic matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant roots tend to like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the organic matter gets below 2%,
then one of the things you would think
[SPEAKER_01]: about recommending to a grower would be
some sort of a cover crop or a newer
[SPEAKER_01]: application or something to boost that
organic matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil tests generally report values for
phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about those curves before,
those response curves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually they've been done for these
four macronutrients and not for the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones you're going to get
results from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes these micronutrients will be
printed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're kind of hard to interpret.
[SPEAKER_01]: The techniques that are used to analyze
nutrients are oftentimes something called
[SPEAKER_01]: an ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send the extractant through that ICP
and it prints out not only the pKa
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, magnesium, but it prints out
everything else too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not unusual to see a soil testing
lab present values for zinc and manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: and iron, even aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time these aren't really very
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't use those for guidance and
what to apply to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we use these when we want to try
to diagnose a problem like a toxicity or
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of an imbalance that they're
typically not used to give recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are usually just pKa calcium,
magnesium, and any sort of pH adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff had a question about pH when you're
finished with what you're discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, do we assume a natural
reduction in pH over time and therefore
[SPEAKER_01]: apply lime to maintain a pH in a range of
that over a five-year period?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with normal rainfall conditions and
all, we lose maybe 500 pounds of cations
[SPEAKER_01]: from the typical soil a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a lot of calcium in your
soil or potassium and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: we lose some of it, but it might not be
enough to really knock the pH down even
[SPEAKER_01]: over a five-year period.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time when we have to worry about that
is on sandy soils where we can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: build up the reserve too much without
pushing a pH too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we push the pH to 6.5 and we have a
sandy soil and we get a lot of rain year
[SPEAKER_01]: after year after year, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could knock the pH down below a
desirable level and then we might have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go back in and reapply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I showed earlier, it's really
difficult to do that in something like
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries because they might live longer
than five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries, you just wait until the end
of their normal life and reapply the lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on raspberries, it's kind of hard to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to try to make sure we get all
that in there before we plant so we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go back in and try to add later
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to mention that nitrates,
some soil testing labs present a value for
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate, but it really is so variable
almost from day to day that it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: very useful guideline for making
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this lab here doesn't even print it,
although they would have it if you would
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other value we sometimes ask growers
to run or make requests for is boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is one of those micronutrients that
can have an impact on plant growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: those values do mean something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will recommend it growers,
particularly strawberries and raspberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for boron if it doesn't automatically
come with the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a diagram of the different
forms of nitrogen and the different cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: that are happening within nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so variable that any time
you do a nitrate or a nitrogen test of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, it's just a snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That those numbers really don't mean
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't pay much attention to them
when we get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron on the other hand I mentioned is an
important nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important for cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have boron, your cells
tend not to elongate very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a root of a strawberry
plant grown in a nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has everything in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide I'm going to show you is
one where the boron was removed from the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how that roots are real
stubby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course a plant without boron has a
difficult time taking up all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we want to make sure we have
adequate boron in the soil so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get a situation like this where the soil
test will show, well you got adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium and phosphorus and magnesium and
calcium, but the plants are showing
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies in those values.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it might not be too low of potassium
or too low of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be that your boron is inadequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we want to look at that
particular nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay back to the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we want to look for is the
type of test that we've run.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case here it was modified Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But different labs run different tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get the values under there,
they don't really mean a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody sends me values of a soil
test, I don't really have any basis for
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing what's low, medium, and high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to trust that the soil testing
lab knows what low, medium, and high is
[SPEAKER_01]: for your particular crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have recommendations on what
low, medium, and high is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, because different labs use
different methods, different extractions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to trust that they know what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and then you get your recommendations
printed out down here based on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: test levels above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned you have to have confidence in
the recommendations provided by your lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best analysis in the world is useless
without a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, many analytical labs
provide these general plant
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations that are good for field
crops, but they don't really fine tune
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the needs of the specific crops
that we might be interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: like strawberries, like raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how many times I've
seen soil tests come back for blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the recommendations look like they
should have been for corn or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the lab has just spit out a
general recommendation for a generic crop
[SPEAKER_01]: on that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without understanding the differences
between these perennial crops and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the crops that require a low pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a word of warning on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to trust that the lab knows
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, Jeff had a question on boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it mobile in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is very mobile in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of those nutrients that you can
come in and apply any time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can apply it right to the soil
surface, even right over the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll wash into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get taken up by the roots and into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one that's fairly easy to
correct, even after the plants are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like some of the other nutrients
that are very difficult to move into the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at a few examples here and
see what we can come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of a soil test,
strawberries on a clay loam soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to trust that the lab
gives us the right values for what's low,
[SPEAKER_01]: medium, high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're reporting these out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medium phosphorus, high potassium,
high calcium, low magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron has more than one pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pH of 5.2, relatively high organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think a soil test
recommendation might provide for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you seconds to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you might want to jot that down
somewhere and see what you can come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I would do,
without knowing anything about the lab or
[SPEAKER_01]: the extract or anything, is look at the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see, oh, it's 5.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's less than 6.2 to 6.5 that we would
ideally want for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would know that some sort of a pH
modification is in line here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also would look here and see that
phosphorus is a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might want to raise that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know that lime contains calcium,
but it also contains magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in this case, magnesium is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one option I would have in this case,
and the recommendation engine should
[SPEAKER_01]: generate this, is when they're
recommending a pH change, they might want
[SPEAKER_01]: to recommend high magnesium lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can raise the pH and provide your
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here the recommendation would be
dolomitic lime because it has high
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arvin Glenn had a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without N represented on the soil test,
what is the basis for the N
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basis for the nitrogen recommendation
is sort of a ballpark figure of what you
[SPEAKER_01]: would apply to a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that particular year, so for example,
strawberries, a standard recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: would be anywhere from 70 to 100 pounds of
nitrogen per acre, just based on the age
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant, based on the crop itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always have to add nitrogen every year,
and that's sort of a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not based on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That nitrogen recommendation is just sort
of a standard practice that a grower would
[SPEAKER_01]: use to fertilize to put you in the
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk in a couple of weeks
about using foliar analysis and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important uses of foliar analysis is
to adjust those ballpark nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations to fit your particular
crop situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the recommendation might say,
well, an established strawberry field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 100 pounds of nitrogen,
but we can use that foliar test to adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: that up or down based on what the values
are in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the recommendation of nitrogen on a
soil test for a perennial crop is just
[SPEAKER_01]: ballpark figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you typically do the first
year of the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonya is commenting that low magnesium can
also be exacerbated by high potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: because they compete for uptake,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some thinking that that can
indeed happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's competition between these cations
for exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soils that are really, really high in
one of the cations and really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really low in the other, there is some
sense that the high cations can suppress
[SPEAKER_01]: the uptake of the lower level,
of the cations in low supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, those situations are pretty rare,
but they can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually going to give you an
example of this in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan is wondering on some of the high lime
soils in central New York where the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: values can be closer to seven,
if an application of sulfur should be made
[SPEAKER_00]: to lower the pH for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, our target pH would be 6.2 to
6.5 for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're up at seven and you're in a
pre-plant situation, I think sulfur would
[SPEAKER_01]: be an appropriate material to apply to
lower that a little bit so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient uptake can be improved and you
get less precipitation form between some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these nutrients that happen at high pH
is where they become unavailable to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at a second example.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is blueberries on a sandy loam soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have low calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have pH that's just about right,
high organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will we do in this situation here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is high, phosphorus is high,
magnesium is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we need calcium,
but the pH is already kind of where we
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really want to raise the calcium
too much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will we do here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we might recommend
calcium sulfate instead of lime to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: our calcium because calcium sulfate
doesn't change the pH very much when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a way of providing calcium without
a big change in pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the soil test recommendation
should know that, take it into account
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever it makes the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say Jeff had a
question about sulfur, requirements for
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sulfur is needed by alfalfa,
but it's also needed for all other crops
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an essential nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all plants need sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our part of the world, sulfur is
rarely limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes down in rainfall, acid rain,
and there's usually plenty of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare that you have to add sulfur for
the nutrient value to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might add sulfur for the pH adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually not for the nutrient value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's sulfur around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in situations here where we're
usually very sulfur deficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least not in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a third example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loamy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were high and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the soil test recommend anything
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it might.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back to what Sonia asked
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, even though we have high
values, if we're really super high in one
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, one cation in particular,
it can depress the uptake of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly, calcium and magnesium can
interact a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium, even though it's low here,
that's actually a pretty high value for
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, but calcium relative to
magnesium is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ratio of calcium and magnesium is
higher than 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: In typical soils, it would be around five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five times as much calcium as magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case here, we actually might need
to recommend a little bit of magnesium to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring that balance back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be unusual for a test like
that to have a little bit of magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate in the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much to change the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't really change the pH,
but it just adds a little bit of magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil to bring that ratio into
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Example four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries, sandy loam soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that we're low in phosphorus,
high in potassium, low in calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is 5.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic matter is pretty low here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you recommend in this case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you think a soil test
recommendation should say?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we would want to do is
try to raise that organic matter a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries like organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.3 is really quite low, so we want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pH is 5.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to lower that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things we know about
blueberries is that they don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: require a whole lot of some of these
cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really good at sucking that out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all we might need to recommend here is
just to lower the pH, increase the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, and those other nutrients will
probably take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're measuring that at a high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we lower the pH, blueberries become
much more efficient at taking these
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a question here about how strong
is the effect of added nitrogen on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends a little bit on your nitrogen
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen
source, which we often recommend on
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries, it acidifies the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we use urea, it also acidifies the soil
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's adding NH4 plus to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we add nitrate to the soil,
like calcium nitrate, it tends to either
[SPEAKER_01]: be neutral or raise the pH a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends a little bit on the source
of nitrogen is the impact on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ammonium sulfate is going to have the
strongest negative effect on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urea is somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nitrate forms a nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wouldn't use nitrogen to actually
try to affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would use it to maybe keep it at a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't use, say, ammonium sulfate to
lower the pH one unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, can blueberries use
nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can use nitrate, but they don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much more preferentially use the
ammonium form of nitrogen and take that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put blueberry roots in a solution
that just has nitrate available to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots will turn black and a plant will
die.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put blueberries in the field and
you apply nitrate fertilizers to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria in the soil under low pH
conditions, which you should have if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're planting blueberries anyway,
will convert that nitrate into ammonium
[SPEAKER_01]: where it can be taken up more readily and
used by the blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nitrate is more leachable and also
ammonium is a better source because it not
[SPEAKER_01]: only lowers the pH, but it's more of a
slow release, more available over a longer
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blueberries can take it up directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a preferable source for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple more examples here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries, clay loam soil, were medium
in phosphorus, high potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: high calcium, high magnesium, good boron,
pH is pretty high, organic matter is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would we recommend here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted to grow blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we go back to that chart we
looked at before and we saw pH up around
[SPEAKER_01]: six and we see here that the cation
exchange capacity is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high because the organic matter is
going to be pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already high in calcium and
magnesium and we don't want a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium and magnesium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries don't like calcium in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best recommendation here is probably
just don't grow blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is just not appropriate for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cation exchange capacity coupled with
the pH is so great that it would take so
[SPEAKER_01]: much sulfur to lower that that it probably
wouldn't be worth it economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that high calcium is going to cause
problems for years on end because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries in a sandy soil, low
phosphorus, low calcium, low pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low boron, low organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this soil test is probably going to
come back with several recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcitic lime because we were low in
calcium, some phosphorus, some boron,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a final example here, raspberries in a
loamy soil, were medium in most things,
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly high in aluminum, good boron,
high pH, organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now most of the time if you saw a soil
test like this, you might say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, I've got medium values for
most of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic matter is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is in the range I might want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably don't have to do too much here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case here, we might want to
correct that with a small amount of P and
[SPEAKER_01]: K.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we might want to add a little bit
higher rate of lime than was recommended
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is this aluminum
value is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can cause problems later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the higher we raise the pH,
the less available aluminum is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might want to push the pH to the
very high end so that it makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum less available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aluminum can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we don't really want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case here, the aluminum value
is providing diagnostic information to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to understand maybe why those plants
aren't growing very well or what we might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do to make a correction before we
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a field of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blueberry plants in this section
here weren't growing so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is the grass in this
section wasn't growing so well either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet down here at this end,
the grass is growing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we took soil tests from three
different places from plantings that were
[SPEAKER_01]: three different ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one place, the plants looked pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sod was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aluminum, phosphorus was OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other place, the plants looked really
pathetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH was a little bit higher than
average.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aluminum was pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants were pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was dead sod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, this is the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH is really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd think blueberries might not do so
well there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were kind of fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sod was living.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants with a higher pH were a lot
better off than the plants that were sick
[SPEAKER_01]: at even a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it appears in the soil test that in
this case here, aluminum was really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be becoming toxic to the
blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we raise the pH, even though the
aluminum was up a little bit, the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: pH makes that aluminum unavailable to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants were able to survive a
little bit longer and do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pH can react and relate to a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at these values of some of
these microdutions can give you clues
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes as to how things were working
out there in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing, the last concept I want to
mention is that this nutrient uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs through three different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct contact with roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the root surface actually almost has
direct contact with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nutrient just kind of jumps right
across that membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass flow, which is nutrients dissolved in
water that get taken into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: through the transpirational stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And diffusion is sort of short distance
transport of these nutrients when they
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolve in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water actually doesn't move through
the plant like mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nutrients diffuse through an
aqueous solution from a level of high
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration in the soil to a lower
concentration inside the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's three different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrients that are primarily taken up
by contact or diffusion must be in close
[SPEAKER_01]: proximity to the root itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root on average only has about 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at most 3% of the surface of that root
is indirectly in contact with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nutrients have to be thoroughly mixed
in order to be taken up prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with corn, but it's appropriate
for all of our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mode of uptake for the various
nutrients based on this root interception,
[SPEAKER_01]: mass flow, and diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different nutrients have different
modes basically being taken up into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen is mostly taken up by mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, nitrogen, nitrate,
nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen get
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved in the aqueous solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a plant transpires, it moves into the
root system and the water leaves the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving the nutrient inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you can put nitrogen on the
soil surface and it gets down into the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots because it dissolves in the water,
it's soluble, and it's taken up by mass
[SPEAKER_01]: flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone also asked earlier about boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron also is very highly soluble and
taken up by mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we can apply boron to the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets dissolved, gets taken up by mass
flow, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can apply it after the plants are
established.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other nutrients are
mostly taken up by things like diffusion,
[SPEAKER_01]: like phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be thoroughly incorporated
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't dissolve very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't move through the soil very
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to have that mixed in with the
soil before we plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way with potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of diffusion, not that much mass
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why magnesium, calcium,
not much diffusion, some mass flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: some root interception.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly for P and K, we want to make
sure we have that mixed in with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the roots won't be able to take
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tables, of course, are going to be
available to you to download.
[SPEAKER_01]: To print off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be right here on this website
in a few days when it gets posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once our plants are established and
are growing, we don't really rely on a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely on a soil test to tell us what our
pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't pay much attention to the
levels of P and K and magnesium and
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plants are in the ground,
we use a foliar analysis to make
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use the pH in conjunction with
foliar analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be the subject of an
upcoming webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week, Eric Hanson is going to talk
about these nutrient sources and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the characteristics of these various
nutrient sources that are out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use in a pre-plant situation to
both modify the pH and add phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, magnesium, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at it from both a conventional
perspective and a perspective of an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I have for the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few minutes left.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to type in some
questions, we'll see if I can try to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to remind everyone that if you
haven't filled out the demographics
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaire or the pre-test,
that they're available down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can email them to me at MCM4 at
Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed either of the first two
webinars, there's a link to them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: archive on the bottom left-hand side of
your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Marvin indicated, Dr. Eric Hanson
from Michigan State University will be our
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff asked about organic sources of
nutrients and their characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the entire webinar is going to
be about next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll save that for Eric to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: An acceptable boron level, generally you
want at least one pound, preferably two
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of the ballpark that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately for boron, it's not so
dependent on soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also most soil testing labs use a
separate extractant for the boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use a hot water extractant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just put hot water in the soil,
take it out, run it for boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the procedure for looking at boron is
fairly standardized across labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can pretty confidently say between
one and two pounds is where you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's less than one pound, you probably
have to supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a lot more standard
among labs than most of the other nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff asks, is there a physiological reason
for blueberries aversion to calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blueberries have evolved in these low
pH soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nutrient levels are very low in these
low pH soils, sandy soils, wet soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've evolved some characteristics
that enable them to survive under those
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those adaptations is
association with endomycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: that colonize the roots of blueberries and
then actually help the blueberry increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface area as they go out and grow
through the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blueberry gives that
endomycorrhizal fungus some carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in return, the fungus pulls in
nitrogen and phosphorus and gives it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, the nitrogen that's in
the soil is in the ammonium form of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people think because of this
endomycorrhizal association, the fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer it and the blueberries ended up
just evolving a preference for that
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is the most available type of
nitrogen in low pH soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, when a regular plant,
a non-blueberry plant takes up nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: interestingly enough, inside the plant,
it converts it into the ammonium form and
[SPEAKER_01]: moves it around and then reconverts it
into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at amino acids and all
that comprise proteins, they're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess maybe a better question is why
other plants haven't evolved an adaptation
[SPEAKER_01]: to take up ammonium nitrogen since
energetically, it's easier to do that than
[SPEAKER_01]: it is to take up nitrate and then reduce
it back down to ammonium and move it
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of calcium, I'm not exactly
sure why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has to do with inside the plant
interactions with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because of the iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow it maybe precipitates with the
iron or inhibits it, but high calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: soils and blueberries just don't go well
together, even if the pH is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we'll recommend in a
soil test if the calcium level is above a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount, even if the pH is kind of
close and you can lower it with sulfur,
[SPEAKER_01]: we might recommend look someplace else.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a good soil for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you just know, historically,
high calcium and blueberries don't go well
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do soil moisture content at the time of
sampling affect soil test results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not if you're just looking at the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what they'll do when they get the
soil back in is they'll often dry it down
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whether you send them dry soil or
they come to the lab and they dry it
[SPEAKER_01]: before they analyze it doesn't make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether there needs to be moisture
correction to soils when they do the
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that has more to do with some labs
scoop soil and some labs weigh it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, do you get a
different result when you scoop it or you
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh it, or you have it moist or it's
dried?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can make a slight difference,
not so much qualitatively, but
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But labs have not come to consensus over
whether it needs to be dried or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most labs do it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most labs do it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: How I feel about ammonium phosphates for
blueberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammonium phosphates are, if you're low in
phosphorus and you need to fertilize the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, that would be a good way of killing
two birds with one stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides an ammonium source of nitrogen
and it provides that phosphorus at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do blueberries have a higher iron
content?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they have a higher iron
content than other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, iron availability
seems to impact blueberries more than iron
[SPEAKER_01]: availability in other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not exactly sure why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody out there knows the answer
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you speaking to us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, next week our topic is soil and
nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be looking at correction of soil
problems, application technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional nutrient sources,
organic nutrient sources, Lyman and pH
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction with Eric Hanson from MSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more questions, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the availability of calcium sulfate in
New York, it's gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are, I'm not
specifically in New York, but drywall for
[SPEAKER_01]: housing is gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some places that I know are
crushing that to extract the material from
[SPEAKER_01]: within the drywall and then selling that
for agricultural uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great source of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high iron content is related to
the low pH like with cranberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at those charts where we
looked at the availability of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: with pH, you can see that at the lower
end, iron availability goes way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, calcium inside the
plant, not outside the plant of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but inside the plant has some impact on
that availability of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have to do with the fact that
active iron in the plant is in a ferric
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe with too much calcium in the
plant, it converts more to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, it's in a ferrous form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It converts more to the ferric form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes from Fe plus two, which is
active, biologically active, to Fe plus
[SPEAKER_01]: three, which is inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium may cause the iron to go from
one form to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: In which case, a leaf analysis will still
show you have iron in the plant because it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't distinguish between the two types.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the type in high calcium
soils is more in a ferric inactive form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, maybe somebody else knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there aren't any other questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I think we'll close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Marvin, for your
insights.
You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope you'll join us all again next
week.
Thank you.
Thank you.
