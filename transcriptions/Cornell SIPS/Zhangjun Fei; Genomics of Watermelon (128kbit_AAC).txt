[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also thank you for giving me this
opportunity to present our work on
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the outline of my talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I will provide a little bit of
background for watermelon, although most
[SPEAKER_00]: people already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I talk about the generation of
high-quality reference genomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will talk about the genomic
sequence of diverse representative
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will talk about the GWAS and
the QTL mapping of important watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: traits using the resource we generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of my talk,
I will spend a couple minutes to introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called QQCap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as most of you already know,
watermelon is a member of the QQBit
[SPEAKER_00]: family, which includes melon, cucumber,
watermelon, and pumpkins, several very
[SPEAKER_00]: important fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a fruit map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see watermelon is a worldwide
fruit crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see watermelon everywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watermelon is also an economical crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the data I got from FAL 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole vegetable is 57 million hectares
was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 6% is for watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in China, even more, you got 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: China is the leading producer of
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the production in the
world is about 105 million tons annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And China produces about 6%, 7% of the
watermelon in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the consumption, per capita
consumption is about 3.5 times in China
[SPEAKER_00]: than the average of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon is also the most popular
fruit worldwide based on the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see watermelon ranked number
one on the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomato is not counted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you count tomato as a fruit,
then tomato is the number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato is about 160 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people treat tomato as
vegetables, not fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see several popular fruits,
watermelon, banana, apple, oranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon, the production is ranked
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon is also a very nutritional
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a nutrition fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the watermelon contains a very
high level of lycopene than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh fruit or vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains like 15 to 20 micrograms per
two cups serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the watermelon also contains this
citrulline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name of citrulline was derived from
the Latin name of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Latin name of watermelon is the
citrullus, lanatas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that citrulline was derived from the
citrullus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very important amino acid
that maintains cardiovascular function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's a report that this amino
acid have some Viagra-like effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly good to your heart,
to your health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon is also emerged as a model
system for non-climacteric fruit quality
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people study like sugar accumulation,
fruit ripening, and rapid fruit expansion,
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon become a very good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the cucubus species, like
watermelon, melon, and the cucumber,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're also as a model system for flower
sex determinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have three different flower types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a male flower, female flower,
and a bisexual flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on combination of these
different flower types, the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant, could have different flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different flower types plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these monotials that only have male
and female flowers in one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other monotials is male and
bisexual flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are two major flower types in
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cucumber, you have all kind of
these seven different flower types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watermelon now has, the cultivar
watermelon have very narrow genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although their phenotype diversity is very
large, but their genetic diversity is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's causing the bottleneck for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the watermelon has a complicated
quantity of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this same as other crops,
like fruit size, sugar content shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit shape, the flavor, and maturity,
shelf life, uniformity, growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also watermelon is sensitive to quite
a lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the most important disease in
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a phasarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's a lot of pests in
watermelon, like aphids, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: rootinol, nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this problem, the narrow
genetic diversity, all kind of different
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated traits, and we need modern
tools, such as the genomic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the focus of the talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be developed for watermelon
to facilitate its breeding and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next I will talk about the reference
sequence we generate for watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we have generated three reference
genomes in the last seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, we formed an international
watermelon genome initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of this project, the
Watermelon Genome Project, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: goals is to generate a high quality draft
genome of Watermelon Catewa 97103,
[SPEAKER_00]: this Catewa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Easter Asio type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has early maturity and high fruit
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have these additional
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the resequencing of the watermelon
accessions that I'm going to talk today
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have generated a lot of
trans-chrome data involved in different
[SPEAKER_00]: interest biological process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will not talk about this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon, the genome size is about
425 million base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is highly homozygous, and it can be
easily inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in 2008, it's not that difficult
to do genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a genome assembly using the
whole genome shotgun approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: purely a nominal sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, the main sequence was
like 40, 50 base pairs, or 75 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's like 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still managed to assemble a very
high quality genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the M50 size is 2.3 million base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty high compared to other
assembled genome at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also assembled about 80%,
more than 80% of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genome size is 425.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assembled 353.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, we did analyze the
unassembled reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found most of them are repetitive
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a genome annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified about 23,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less than most of the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato had 35,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even our adopted had 27,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason we have much less gene,
this could be one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we analyzed is we found
there's no whole genome duplication event
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred in watermelon, and also in
cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't find any recent whole genome
duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the opposite, they have two recent
whole genome duplications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in tomato and potato, we have a recent
whole genome duplication event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all unicorns have an ancient
duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this ancient duplication
also exists in watermelon and cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without this whole genome duplication,
that's why we got much less gene numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: in cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, we sequenced the pumpkin
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in the cucumber family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gene number in pumpkin is like
32,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much higher than cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some comparative genomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our finding is that the transition from
the 21 chromosome unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the unicorns have an ancient ancestor,
which has 21 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that involved a large number of fusions
and fusions in order to reach the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 chromosome structure of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this mosaics of different
ancestor blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the whole genome evolution,
this shows how the genomes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor come to the modern watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we identified a large synteny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a lot of synteny between the
cucurbit species, the melon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also checked this citrulline metabolic
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing is that we
compared it to our odopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we found that there's such
expansion in these two families.
[SPEAKER_00]: In odopsis, there's only one gene members.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in watermelon, we have two members for
these two gene families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used RNA-seq data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked the expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that these three genes are
downregulated during fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That corresponds to the elevated
citrulline content during fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these two gene families are
involved in degradation of the citrulline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a citrulline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a degradation, although they form
this circle and feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we believe that citrulline
accumulation in the maturing fruit is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely due to decrease in activity,
so this decreased activity of citrulline
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rapid advance of sequencing
technology, so we recently sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: another genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one, the NASA MIR3, is a East Asia
eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, this one was an American
eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can clearly see the big difference
of these two eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruit shape is a citrulline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is round.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is oblong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fruit size, this one is much
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is about 25 to 35 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is about 10 to 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also other phenotypic
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we sequenced this one,
because of a group in Charleston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was developed in Charleston,
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are using this as a system to
develop all kinds of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are also using the whole genome
shotgun, using the most recent Illumina
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't use any pack bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the difference after the
technology involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the M50 size from 2.3
million to 7.5 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 million increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the genome we assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when rates are getting longer,
then a lot of repetitive sequence now can
[SPEAKER_00]: be assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assembled about more than 90% of the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this genome is probably the highest
quality we have assembled so far in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about the similar number of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we identified the single
nucleotide variations between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between East Asia and American nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the genome of these two
species are highly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SNP rate is only about six SNPs out of
10,000 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also identified structure
variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger insertions, deletions, invulsions,
or duplications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified mainly deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified 271 deletions in Charleston
gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This American nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only you can see when we talk about
the wild reference genome next,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we only have 233 kilobase deletions
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also 500 kilobase, 600 kilobase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this NASA 1S3 genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, we found that these
deletions are enriched in this
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid-weight QTL region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this orange lines are
fluid-weight QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five fluid-weight QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chromosomes 6 to 11, I didn't show
here because they don't contain any
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid-weight QTL as far as reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the 36 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these deletions are in these five
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's understandable because you can
see this fluid, two fluid, the fluid size,
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid weight are highly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, next I will talk about a wild
watermelon, the reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more interesting than the American
nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we initiated this wild
watermelon before that Charleston Gray,
[SPEAKER_00]: American nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the phenotypic difference
of these two accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wild species, there's no sugar
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to eat it because it's also
bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has wild flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hard texture is very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has late maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also mature, but it's very late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing of this one is the
resistance to the preserved in the rail,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fundraise 012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the non-sum 1,3 is sensitive to this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assembly, the quality is about the
same as non-sum 1,3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we emphasize about 2.1 million base
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assembled about 80% of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a comparative genomic
analysis and used a molecular clock to
[SPEAKER_00]: date the speciation events between the
wild and the contribute watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that the speciation event
was occurred about 1.3 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomato and potato speciation event
occurred about 6 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the same species,
it's a much closer time than tomato and
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified the genomic variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see now, we have 3.9 SNP
identified, compared to 200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 5% of the SNPs identified
between non-sum 1,3 and the charlatan
[SPEAKER_00]: gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means this genome and the wild
species and the contribute watermelon,
[SPEAKER_00]: their genome are highly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that almost 16,000 genes
were affected by these variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 80% of the genes in the
genome, 70%, maybe 70% of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also identified 680,000 small
indels, which lead into frame shifting in
[SPEAKER_00]: 247 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also identified the large structure
variations, the present, and the absent
[SPEAKER_00]: variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified, in non-sum 1,3,
we identified 6.7 million base pairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to like 200 or 600 kilobase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much, much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gene affected by this is 270.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we identified 5.7 million
present variations in this wild
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains 223 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, so this wild
accession, they have resistance to found
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, found risk 0, 1, and 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compare this genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the R genes,
MS resistant genes, we only found that two
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are totally unique,
that only exist in this PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one gene would exist in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this non-sum 1,3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means these genes are totally
absent in one or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may check this present and absent
variations, because some genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not totally gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variation may be just cause a frame
shift, maybe truncate a part of intron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found several MSLR genes that are in
this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, disease-resistant genes,
disease-related genes, like receptor-like
[SPEAKER_00]: protein kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also found some genes that are
related to abatic stress, like heat shock
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may also explain the difference
between these two, the phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: difference of these two watermelon
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is highly resistant to disease and
also can grow in very harsh conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like desert, a high temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this stuff may relate to the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also identified the inversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified 66 inversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, we identified one
interchromosome rearrangement event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, this is in cartilage
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cartilage watermelon, this
watermelon chromosome 11 in wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: this part was rearranged into chromosome 2
in cartilage species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did several checks to make sure it's
not assembly error.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using read the paired enderase or
met paired enderase to confirm that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: a real interchromosome rearrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the implication of this rearrangement
in watermelon qualities or phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generated the watermelon reference
genome, which provided a great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with this resource available,
now we can do genome resequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did genome resequencing with a wide
range of watermelon accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon was sought.
[SPEAKER_00]: To originate from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was originated from Africa,
then distributed to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether it's originated from southern
Africa or western Africa, so now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear evidence to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people thought it's originated from
southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, people argue that it may be
originated from western Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not resolved yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about 4,000 years ago, the seeds were
the paintings of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This painting of watermelon was found in
Egyptian tombs that built more than 4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see that this
watermelon, I'm not sure the picture
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shape, the first shape is different
from the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild type or wild type watermelon is
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a round shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that 4,000 years,
this one is a little bit long,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure whether it's that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that 4,000 years ago,
people already started to duplicate
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon and use watermelon as a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a pharaoh's fruit in
Egyptian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a watermelon in the 17th
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never see watermelon now,
this kind of watermelon nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in 17th century, the watermelon
is like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you think, oh, people living in that
area is very tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do this kind of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a modern day sweet dessert
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like the evolution history
of watermelon based on the available
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that the scenario of
watermelon evolution still remains largely
[SPEAKER_00]: unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, what is the ancestor of
watermelon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know this wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of different wild
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But which one is the ancestor,
the ancient ancestor of watermelon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is, what is the direct
progenitor of a category of watermelon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what's the domestication
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question, I'm sure it's
very hard to clearly answer those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are trying to use this genomic
sequence of data to answer part of these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the watermelon has four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this red one, it's a Cetralos nanatas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a watermelon species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also includes three sub-species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is Cotyledon watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotyledon watermelon also divided into
American ecotype and East Asia ecotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this semi-wild
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a Cetroidis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call horses watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Cetralos rihanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a Colicensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is Nardia nanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to pronounce this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's originally called the jump-sport
cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they classify it as a Cetralos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this is a fruit of that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the taxonomy in watermelon is
also a huge debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people classify this as five different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people said it's probably seven
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they class this one as different
species, not sub-species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected 174 representative
accessions from a germ plant collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a genome re-sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generated a total of 910 gigabit data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average re-sequence coverage depth
for each genome is about 15x.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified 24 million SNPs,
a lot, because of those wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see we only identified about 1
million SNPs from this cultivar species
[SPEAKER_00]: within those groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified 5 million in semi-wild,
another close to 6 million from Cetroides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 7 million from Colicensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this SNP to derive the genetic
diversity using the pi parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found the cultivar species,
the genetic diversity is less than 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 out of 10 to negative 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Colicensis, the genetic diversity
of Colicensis is pretty high, 6.48.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compare this to other crops,
and you can see the genetic diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon is extremely low, even lower
than cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumber, the cultivar one is about 1.85.
[SPEAKER_00]: East Asia is greater than 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rice, Indica 5.7, Japonica 3.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soybean, the cultivar one is close to
2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this confirms the previous study that
the cultivar watermelon has a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very narrow genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That caused a huge problem for breeding,
a bottleneck for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then used this SNP to build this
phylogenetic tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we found is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used cucumber as a root, as an odd
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found this one was not a cluster to
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cluster to cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these two clustered together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as expected, we found all the cultivar
species, they clustered together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this semi-wild, then this setroidis,
and this wild species, they clustered
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have thought about,
does this one is a real watermelon,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it a melon, or is it a cucumber?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one we did is, the phylogenetic
tree clearly shows it's not a watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we map the roots to all kinds of
different genomes we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cucumber genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have watermelon genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have melon genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two pumpkin genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We align the roots to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found it matched most to melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we did fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found the chromosome number of this
one is 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 12 chromosome pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same as melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cucumber has seven chromosome pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon has 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the melon has 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we concluded that this one is not a
watermelon species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a melon species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we did not use this one in the
downstream analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a population structure analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conclusion from this population
structure analysis is that this semi-wild
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon should be the direct progenitor
of the cultivative watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And originally, people thought of this
collisenses should be the ancient ancestor
[SPEAKER_00]: of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this population structure analysis did
not support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can see, we didn't see any of
this orange block.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see the orange allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see, in the cultivative species,
we didn't see any orange block from this
[SPEAKER_00]: collisenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesized that these two
species, you can see they have green,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue, orange, and this was cyan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have all colors from the
cultivative species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hypothesized that these two could be
the ancient ancestor of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this conclusion is not that
conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we didn't sample a lot of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can rule out this collisenses as an
ancient ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we found that this one,
this setroidis, or lanatas, the
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies, they could be a separate
species instead of a subspecies based on
[SPEAKER_00]: this population structure analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say it's highly different from the
other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then identified the selective swap
using the pi ratio between the semi-wild
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon and the cultivative watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified the selective swaps
across the whole 11 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's very interesting is
that we identified this selective swap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the huge genetic diversity
decrease, reduction, in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that this region corresponds
to a fruit-weight KTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fruit-weight is a major trait that was
selected during human domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we found this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we found a lot of other
interesting stuff that I will not talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about here due to the time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watermelon, as I mentioned before,
a major problem for watermelon is a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we checked the watermelon genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified 46 MBS-LR genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That represents the least number of MBS-LR
genes in any genomes of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a cucurbit species normally
has very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watermelon even has less than cucumber
and melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other, like tomato, you got several
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in watermelon, you only have 46.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem for watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we think about, because of the
wild species, they are highly resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon, to all kinds of different
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesize that maybe some genes
were lost during the domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This analysis was not done on the 134
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on 20 accessions that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the results should be similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we aligned the reads to the reference
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that are aligned, we do a genome
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divided those are aligned to two
different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group one is from the cutlery
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the group two includes the
semi-wild and the wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the group one,
we didn't find.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the gene that was missing in the
watermelon genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't find any diseased genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from the wild species, we did an
assembly of those unmapped reads to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found it's highly enriched with
diseased resistant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then mapped these reads to confirm
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a sequencing assembly error or
whatever in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mapped the cutlery reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mapped the reads from this cutlery to
these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means these genes are real missing
during the domestication process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion is that a large portion
of diseased resistant genes have been lost
[SPEAKER_00]: during watermelon domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this domestication process,
which have focused on desirable food,
[SPEAKER_00]: trade, and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not focused on diseased resistant
until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, next I will talk about using this
data, the resequenced data we generate and
[SPEAKER_00]: other resources we generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show you several examples on how we
identify QTLs using GWAS approach and also
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL mapping approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the GWAS analysis on FAN1
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified QTLs on chromosome 1 and
chromosome 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also FAN2 resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified major QTLs in chromosome 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sugar content, we identified a major
QTL on chromosome 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one I will talk a little bit more
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bitterness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major trait during domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think probably no one would
like to eat a bitterness of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was mapped to the chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later we cloned this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's using the natural accessions,
the 134 natural accessions to do GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that proves that it can identify
some interesting QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a recombinant inbred line
population, real population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this real population was derived by
cross from this 971-3, the East Asia
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotype, and also this wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have whole genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what genome sequence for both?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we generated this real population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a shallow genome resequence for
this 96 reals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we generated like 247 gig data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average genome coverage was about
5.2x for this real line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked the recombination pattern and
also the origin of the genome from which
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this blue means that this region is
from 971-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So red means this region is from the ZPI,
from that wild watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green means heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That confirms that this population is high
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't find any green, or at least I
couldn't find any green from this figure,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are heterozygous, because this is a
highly imbred real population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It confirms the quality of this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this population to identify
additional QTLs, or kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary approach for QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this for farm 1 is
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the peak of the farm 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farm 1 also mapped to the same region
using GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one did not map this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for farm 2, we identified this major
QTL, also identified in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we identified another QTL on
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's chromosome 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for serial content, it's confirmed the
GWAS data is also on chromosome 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did a further analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mapped them to very narrow regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between these two beam markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within this region, we found a large
cluster of transmembrane sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we compare to do some comparative
analysis with the melon, melon sugar QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: also contains this transmembrane sugar
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some functional analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that one of them indeed
can transport sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is the fine QTL mapping of a
bitterness trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we count this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, this is the GWAS analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's first mapped to the chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we use this real population and
narrow it down to this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use 1,647 F2 population and
narrow it down to these two markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's highly co-segregated with this
indel marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't find any recombination events
for this marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we narrow it down to, I think it's
about, I forgot the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The region contains five genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, we found is a 200 base
pair mitochondria sequence inserted at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth axon in non-bitter accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this 200 base pair mitochondria
sequence insertion in the non-bitter
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions are highly consistent within
this 96 real population and also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the natural population, we check
whether the beta or the non-bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for non-bitter accessions,
they all contain this 200 base pair
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria sequence insertions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For beta watermelon, they do not contain
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this 200 base pair insertion
disrupts the function of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will not generate that beta
chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go to that new project,
introduce to that new project,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to provide a summary on what
I talked so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is a high quality reference
genomes have been generated for an East
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia genotype, or ecotype, I'm sorry,
an American ecotype, and a wild cetroides
[SPEAKER_00]: accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compatible genomic analysis provide
lower insights into watermelon genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sequence of the genomes of 134
diverse watermelon accessions generate a
[SPEAKER_00]: large, comprehensive watermelon genomic
variation map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provide another very useful resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this genetic variation map,
we find that a cultivated watermelon has a
[SPEAKER_00]: very narrow genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's causing the bottleneck for
watermelon breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we find that a large portion of
disease-resistant genes have been lost
[SPEAKER_00]: during watermelon domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the sequence analysis,
we find that this one, previously
[SPEAKER_00]: classified as a watermelon species,
should belong to watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sub species, the cetroides,
could be a separate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not be classified as a sub
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the GWAS analysis identified QTLs from
a number of agronomically important
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, including the found resistance,
sugar content, fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beta gene was further cloned
through QTL fine mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the process of doing
functional confirmation of this beta next
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last, I will spend two or three minutes
talking about this QQCAP project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a newly funded project by USDA
NIFA through the specialty crop program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of this project is Leveraging
Applied Genomics to Increase
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease-Resistant in QQBITa Crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beginning of a new project to
develop additional genomic resources for
[SPEAKER_00]: the QQBITa community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebecca Grumet from Michigan State is the
PI of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have 21 copy eyes from 11
institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the leader of the genomic and
bioinformatics team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael Mazurik is from plant breeding
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is leading the squash team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Christian Smart also involved in
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project has three objectives,
the big objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is to develop genomics and
bioinformatics breeding tool kits for
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated crop improvement across the
QQBITa session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is to perform genomic
assisted breeding to integrate disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in QQBIT category ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third one is to perform economic
impact analysis of cost of production and
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease control and provide readily
accessible information to facilitate
[SPEAKER_00]: disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm highlighting several points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because these three big objectives have
a lot of small objectives, I can't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: too much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the bioinformatics team,
there are two main objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is perform GBS analysis of
PI, that means jump up collections of the
[SPEAKER_00]: four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably do GBS for about 1,500
collections for each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 6,000 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from those species, based on the GBS
information, we identify our core
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of 384 accessions for each of
the four species that can be used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community resource for GWAS analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, we probably do 10,000,
do genotyping for 10,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide access to QQBIT genomic tools
in a database via this international QQBIT
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This website was developed by my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: About seven or eight years ago,
it was also maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this database was developed in my group
during the past seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get any funding for this
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now finally, we got some funding to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plan to make a huge improvement of
this database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get some small money from the
company, but that's not compared to this
[SPEAKER_00]: big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a list of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the focus in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a major focus for watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downy mildew is for cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have others, the gummy
sterminal blight, and also the viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to thank
everyone involved in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't provide all the leads in
this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to emphasize several key
people in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Hongho Sen from my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did most of the assembly and the
genomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Shao Gui.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a visiting student in my lab,
and now in this national NER series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he also did the genomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the QTL mapping and major wet lab work
was done in Yongxu's lab in this
[SPEAKER_00]: institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all other people contributed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funding support, the work in my
lab for this project was from National
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Foundation, USDA, and city
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you have fun with watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
