[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Frank Rossi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professor in the Department of
Horticulture here at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get a lot of questions from the
general public and even from golf course
[SPEAKER_00]: superintendents and other people who
really spend a fair amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have a really good lawn,
but I really care that I don't damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to have a lawn that
takes me less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be able to have to spend
the time they spend at Yankee Stadium in
[SPEAKER_00]: Center Field, but I want it to look like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fact is it's a lot easier than
you might think, and it's a simple matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of making sure you mow right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the blades sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're mowing at a correct
height so the grass can grow long and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, the longer the grass
blades grow, the deeper the roots grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less stuff you have to put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the clippings on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is return the
nutrients, and you shouldn't have much
[SPEAKER_00]: problem having a really high quality lawn
and protecting the environment at the same time.
