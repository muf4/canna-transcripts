[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really my honor to be here and speak
with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've heard about all of
these wonderful veggies and fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's upon us, food scientists,
to bring them to your table and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve that goodness and that freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just tell you some of the
things that we do in food science to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, food we do take for granted
oftentimes, and we do have, as consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: big expectations when it comes to food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to list here some of the most
important elements that are expected from
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some we think about, some we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like safety, we take it for granted,
we buy it from the store, we think,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, it's got to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's easier to have it safe than
other times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And us food scientists know quite a bit
about that and work in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do in food science touches on
pretty much all of these points here,
[SPEAKER_00]: safety, nutrition, and that wholesomeness
of the food that gives us enjoyment,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to work on that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, when we apply these methods
of manufacturing or processing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do it in a sustainable,
environmentally friendly way, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are more and more efforts in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, we do work primarily on fruit
and vegetable products and dairy products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we touch pretty much all food
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to capture them on the slide
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't forget this, because we are
actually, speaking of enjoyment now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working in those areas, and they
have become quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few examples here of some of the
work that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In food science, safety, I mentioned
earlier that oftentimes consumers take it
[SPEAKER_00]: for granted, and it should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be in the foods that you buy in
the supermarket or in the local market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are things that happen to the
food where it can get contaminated with
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that can make us sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a program, we're looking at,
first of all, how bacteria can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: foods and what are the bacteria that can
make us sick and how can we prevent them
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting into our food?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had programs like this very
successful for many years, and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: brought this excerpt for you to see that
we are getting recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting national and international
recognition for some of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dairy team, our dairy microbiologists,
and Dean Bor has helped build that
[SPEAKER_00]: program, have helped over the years both
consumers and the industry with achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're here to talk today about what's
coming up new, the so-called revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if we can call that
exactly a revolution, but certainly we're
[SPEAKER_00]: leading some new ways in which we can keep
our food safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working, for instance, on some
materials that one can use in
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing plants to prevent bacteria
from attacking us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from perpetuating this
contamination, and you see here a photo of
[SPEAKER_00]: some bacterial cells on a surface that in
my group we have developed collaboratively
[SPEAKER_00]: with a group in nanoengineering that
doesn't use any chemicals, that just uses
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface features to prevent bacteria
from sticking to that surface so that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end we mitigate contamination and also
use less chemicals to clean the equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: so it could be in the end a more
sustainable way of doing food processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I'm personally very excited
about is what's happening now in food
[SPEAKER_00]: science on our both locations,
Ithaca and Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen in recent years an increased
interest in these alternative new
[SPEAKER_00]: processing technologies where we rely less
on heat to treat the food to make it safe
[SPEAKER_00]: and last on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do now have a big initiative here at
Cornell where we are getting some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: new technologies that enable us to keep
food safe without the use of heat or using
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have, for example, this new high
pressure treatment technology that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: using to kill bacteria in certain foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have in Geneva one of the best
pieces of equipment that could be at any
[SPEAKER_00]: university actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of many places that have
that that help us, help the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the safety of foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the same line we are getting some
other technologies that help us make new
[SPEAKER_00]: foods, foods that are fresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these we hope will help us restructure
the way some foods are being manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've relied on heat for many decades,
for centuries now, to make food and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fine and heat is actually sometimes you
can't make a food safe without heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also looking at some of these
novel technologies that will allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: use different principles to make food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one example that I want to show you
because you may not even be aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying already some of the foods
that are made using these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well imagine putting the food on the
bottom of the ocean, actually at the
[SPEAKER_00]: deepest point in the ocean in the Mariana
Trench, you only have about a sixth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: total pressure that we are using now in
food manufacturing to treat foods so that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria is killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been successful for a number of
products and these are commercial products
[SPEAKER_00]: that you might have bought and you didn't
realize that they were treated with high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we can now buy fresh guacamole
from the store and well it's processed but
[SPEAKER_00]: it retains that freshness in the variety
of foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all of these, well highly
expensive right now, juices like six
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar bottle of the sujas or naked
juices, all of these very cool things,
[SPEAKER_00]: your green juices that if you had treated
them they certainly wouldn't look like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they wouldn't taste as fresh and
they were made possible by using these
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately Courtney you can't put
strawberries in that high pressure unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and still have them maintain their
structure but in many cases you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually helping understand better
which microorganisms you can kill using
[SPEAKER_00]: this technology, which foods you can make
safe and also improve their shelf life
[SPEAKER_00]: using this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to also help industry to
adopt this technology in their own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also trying to utilize these new
technologies in different ways because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can now use raw products and treat them
with high pressure and really use them to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture new types of food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an image of the high pressure
treatment unit that we have in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are doing for instance in my
program right now, we're understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more what this treatment does to
different chemical compounds in foods,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some structural changes that
happen and you can actually take proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: from milk or take proteins from your
pulses and other sources and expose them
[SPEAKER_00]: to pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't add any ingredients,
you don't add any acid, you don't add heat
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet you can obtain these interesting
structures here that you kind of have a
[SPEAKER_00]: jello type product or yogurt type product
just by the use of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're leading the way in making those
things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not products that you have
on the shelf right now but we're hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll be part of the making of these
products in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will be both interesting
products, retain freshness, nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and safe at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to thank you for
your attention.
