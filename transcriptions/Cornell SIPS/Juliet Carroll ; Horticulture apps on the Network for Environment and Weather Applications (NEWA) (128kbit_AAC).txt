[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with a little background,
NUA is a crowdsourced network.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather station owners share the
weather data through the network and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide to us feedback and guidance on
what we should or should not be doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we could do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather data is collected every 15 minutes
and tabulated in hourly and daily
[SPEAKER_00]: summaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collecting precipitation,
temperature, relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf wetness, solar radiation,
wind speed, wind direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers that purchase these weather
instruments now have the option of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: soil moisture and soil temperature
sensors, but we still haven't put into
[SPEAKER_00]: place the API that will actually pull that
data in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go to one minute data,
and we're going to be doing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sister stations in the network are
designated for missing data to fill gaps
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we don't have bizarre accumulated
degree days and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of missing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we'll extrapolate one hour gaps in our
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decision support tools are primarily
for IPM, but we also have some for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which is why I'm here today to
share those with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are built, obviously,
from that weather data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit more about NUA's history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created in 1996 by Kurt Petzold.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, he was the vegetable IPM
coordinator in the New York State IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was an association they
charged membership fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, it's open access with land
grant university partners and grower
[SPEAKER_00]: association partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we started out with sensor and
Campbell instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensor was bought by Sensotronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those instruments went obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're partnering with Rainwise
Incorporated for all of our weather
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we do have a number of on-set
instruments in the network, some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be using the name brand HOPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: HOPE is the company that manufactures
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also pull in National Weather Service
airport data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we partner with State Climatology
Mesonets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, right now, our one and only
partner is the New Jersey State
[SPEAKER_00]: Climatology Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're working on some other Mesonet
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we were going out with our
laptops and manually downloading these
[SPEAKER_00]: data, bringing them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating messages, putting those messages
on a system called Codaphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers could dial into those and get
that message du jour about what was going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, what the IPM program thought that
people should be paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We switched to modems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to say we've saved about $8,000
in operating costs by eliminating our
[SPEAKER_00]: modems and phone lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big savings, which was
important when NUA was zero funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I say NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don said Neewa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like potato potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hear me say NUA, just know that
I am talking about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, we have a few stations that are
still using file transfer protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most are using internet protocol to
send the data directly to a website at
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scrape that data off their web into our
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rainwise has developed a cellular data
modem system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for growers who have a desire to have a
weather instrument, but it's a very remote
[SPEAKER_00]: location, they don't have broadband,
they can use the cellular data option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now up to 432 weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I gave this talk a month ago in
plant pathology, we had 428.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're growing all the time,
just all the time growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have weather stations we're pulling
data in in 23 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 10 member states and then grower
members in additional five other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets swelled up when we have airports
in states that are neighboring a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower-owned weather instrument because we
need that sister data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need complementary data so that we know
that we're not going to have outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open access, real time, query-based,
decision support with built-in biofix and
[SPEAKER_00]: an interactive user interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our current website, built in
2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for the millennials in the
audience, you're going to be groaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, that's so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, it's pretty much geriatric now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to get money to rebuild
our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, two grants later, no bites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll still continue trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue menu at the top for the audience
in Geneva, I'll try to use the current
[SPEAKER_00]: cursor as a pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this blue menu follows you throughout
the website and gives you access to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tools and products on NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up here, there's kind of a neat little
utility that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's find the National Weather Service
weather forecast for your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just enter your city, state,
zip code and hit go and it'll get you to
[SPEAKER_00]: that National Weather Service page with
forecast data, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This map, which starts out here,
it will save your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't disable location services on
your phone, your phone always knows where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so does NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time you go in, if you're in
North Carolina, that map's going to center
[SPEAKER_00]: on North Carolina instead of New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to do little things as we can to
make the NDU user experience more fun and
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every weather station has a station page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the station pages, basically,
the key is that there are these quick
[SPEAKER_00]: links to the Pest Forecasts that'll give
you the result for that Pest Forecast or
[SPEAKER_00]: that tool right there for today's date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It defaults to the current date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, there are some quick links
to weather products, degree days,
[SPEAKER_00]: hourly data, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's NUA's map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green icons on there are the NUA
weather stations that are owned primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: by growers, but some are owned by the
land-grant institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, Connecticut's land-grant,
Yukon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They manage all of their weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have about 40 in their network,
one in every county, and then some
[SPEAKER_00]: additional ones on grower farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primarily, their focus is the turf and
landscape industry with those county-based
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you can see, there are the little
airplane icons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the airport locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this map here shows you the
member states that are in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in orange are those states where
there are one or two, maybe three
[SPEAKER_00]: individual growers that have purchased a
weather station and are subscribing into
[SPEAKER_00]: the NUA system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about $290 a year for an individual
subscriber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a statewide member,
an unlimited number of weather stations
[SPEAKER_00]: can connect to NUA for a fee of $1,750 per
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially our revenue stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the math, and you can see that
we operate on something less than $20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly limited revenue stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got over 430 stations now,
so it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't shown this slide in my previous
seminars, but I thought, OK, I'll show
[SPEAKER_00]: this to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the data is going,
how it moves around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data goes to Rainwise Net.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scrape it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm following the black arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into our NUA database,
which is at the Northeast Regional Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Center, and then pushes that data to the
NUA server, where it goes through a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of tools and algorithms, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the end user will access that on
nua.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some metadata for quality
control, and that informs the NUA server
[SPEAKER_00]: location of the station page, for
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just gives you, in a nutshell,
what we're doing with cloud computing and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're moving all of these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does NUA, or NUA, benefit the
programs of the horticulture section?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, plant development and mental
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant phenology models can be developed
into tools to inform management decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a couple of these during
today's seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather data can be used to validate and
implement horticulture models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, the data and models that
are in NUA can be used for research,
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching, and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, Greg, I'm not going to,
no pressure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ian Merwin used to use some of the NUA
Apple models for his teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't mean that to be, in any way,
a plug or, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was, hey, Julie, you really
should tell people about NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what my group of state
coordinators has been telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these seminars, I'm trying to tell the
Cornell community about NUA so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these data could enrich your own
research programs and teaching programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to definitely stimulate
thinking about developing and utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: NUA to benefit our agricultural and
horticultural commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to now talk about what the
predictive tools are that are in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasingly, I grew up, and they were
called models, disease forecast models,
[SPEAKER_00]: insect phenology models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasingly now, they're called tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who work kind of in
this arena, it's not even precision
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being called digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasingly, growers are utilizing
this type of technology in their crop
[SPEAKER_00]: production practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spend a little bit of time
on pest forecast tools, like nothing more
[SPEAKER_00]: than this one slide, just to give you a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the drop down menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the NUA website of what we currently
have available, this menu has shrunk
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've started combining into one
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion models, for instance, the disease
models are all in one page.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grape models are all in one page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it a little bit easier for
the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have 16 plant disease tools,
11 insect phenology tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now providing five day forecasts and
details on past and current conditions in
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower can look forward five days
and know they have to plan to do some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of intervention on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we want growers to be able to do
is to assess risk, learn about IPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get decision support through NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather products, I'm going to spend a
little more time on because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're more relevant to the horticulture
arena, where we're looking at plant
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be wanting to know more about
just growing degree days and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tabulation of degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're currently tabulating degree days
for 12 base temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We accumulate that value starting January
1, March 1, April 1, and May 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily informed by the commodities that
we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance in apples, which I know
probably more about than any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that are that have tools on NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In apples, basically the common tenet is
that there's no growth before March 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't even bother looking at
accumulation of degree days before March
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change is changing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed we are getting weird things
going on before March 1st now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exciting thing is the degree day
calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had created a degree day calculator in
PHP on our ancient website before the one
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the programming language
wasn't compatible with the new system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't get this degree day calculator
resurrected until this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting to be able to use
the degree day calculator once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about all of these various
degree days that are in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might say, well, why do you have
just 12 base temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that we're already using
these base temperatures shown in this
[SPEAKER_00]: table for a number of different tools in
NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use that as our drop down
selection because the algorithms are
[SPEAKER_00]: already built.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of these I want to bring to your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed corn mag at 39 degrees Fahrenheit
one and the 14.3 degrees Fahrenheit one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 14.3 degrees centigrade one for brown
marmorated stink bug have no tools
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no brown marmorated stink bug
developmental model right now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But research has shown that its base
temperature for development is 14.3
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, OK, well, let's just put
that in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can then query that or look at the
tables for degree days knowing that and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically make some intuitive inferences
or deductions from the data as it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed corn mag at one was developed
because my colleague Ken Wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: who works with field crops, has a
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Julie, you know, I'd love to
be able to calculate base degree days for
[SPEAKER_00]: base 39 Fahrenheit so that I can put the
information in my newsletter because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know when it gets to a certain point,
seed corn mag is at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I alert the growers through my
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he can look at that for all the
different locations across New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that in his newsletter now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of maybe how things get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get rolling along just because you
know that there's a base developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature or there's a model out there
and somebody wants a piece of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the rest of these, there is an
actual tool in NUA for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, for growing degree days,
GDD, that's just, again, also just the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree day tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to say, expect lilac to be
at this phenological stage with this
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of GDD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I rely on the faculty
across Cornell and across the reach of NUA
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, I'd love to have a model that did
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's develop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the degree day calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows you essentially how all of
the tools on NUA are built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all will have a little query on
the left-hand side where you select the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, weather station, the type of degree
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I chose base 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accumulation start date, I allowed
this to default to January 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hit Get Report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model starts out with a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts out with a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you don't have to know the
station name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually look at the map and say,
OK, geographically, this one's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: closest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from an altitude perspective,
I think I'm going to select this other one
[SPEAKER_00]: because the topography might be better
with better match at that other weather
[SPEAKER_00]: station location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the map gives a little more flexibility
than just knowing the name of the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: station location.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you hit Get Report,
the wheel starts to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That query is sent to the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results page pops back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this chart builds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wherever you scroll your mouse over
the chart, this pop-up box will pop up and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the actual data for that
particular point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chart above, again, gives the past,
the current, and the five-day forecast
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daily degree days, base 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seasonal accumulation starting as
my query requested from January 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we started to get colder
in mid-September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's kind of chilly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had frost at my house last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another way that you can use
weather data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hindsight, gee, I think it got really
cold on February 14 this past winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really mild for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this cold snap, a number of
people are attributing to one of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why we didn't have a lot of stone
fruit this year in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apricots, peaches, nectarines,
sweet cherries, the flower buds could have
[SPEAKER_00]: been significantly damaged by this
temperature event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the daily summary
table circled here, you can see how mild
[SPEAKER_00]: these temperatures were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading up to this, the max temperature
and the min temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got down to minus 10 degrees
Fahrenheit, which is pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you wanted to look at this
from an hourly standpoint, you could query
[SPEAKER_00]: the hourly data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see each hour how cold it was
and for how long the cold event lasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes that also weighs in on
the level of damage that you'll get on
[SPEAKER_00]: flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vegetative buds in woody plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that you can use the data in
NOAA is to look at rainfall data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was giving a talk in North Carolina
to the Apple Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to Gene Klimstra, who had set
up a weather instrument the year before,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, Gene, is there something that
happened so I could go into the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that out, and share with the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about the use of rainfall
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got eight inches of rain in October
when we were trying to harvest our apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get in there in a timely way
to harvest our apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to wait and wait it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went into these are in monthly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing that I want to
point out with this slide is the data is
[SPEAKER_00]: in monthly tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get data that spans like
the end of September into the early
[SPEAKER_00]: October, you have to go through the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to the month of September
and the month of October, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows the month of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here the daily data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three inches of rain on one day,
an inch each of the previous two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look down the hourly data,
you'll see that at some points,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were getting a half an inch of rain,
a third of an inch of rain, a quarter of
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch of rain per hour was falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is kind of what the projection is
that we're going to be needing to expect
[SPEAKER_00]: and to plan for given climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have these intense rainfall
events and these bizarre temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: events that may impact our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this type of data gives the grower the
ability to document that something really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have crop insurance,
then they can document that this
[SPEAKER_00]: significant event happened and damaged
their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to go over the crop
management tools that are in NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three that are really NUA-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cover those towards the end of this
segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're assessing risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting decision support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary ones we have in NUA that
are currently programmed in as tools are
[SPEAKER_00]: crop load management tool for apple and an
irrigation tool for apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tool that was created by Frank
Rossi and Art Degatano with the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is their forecast suite of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do then is I link to these
within NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not using NUA data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using the Cooperative Weather
Observer Program data.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are human beings that are still
observing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using weather for the National
Weather Service and have been doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: since, I believe, the 1800s, some sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these data are then used to drive a
suite of disease risk models, turf and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed development, irrigation information,
and heat stress and frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these tools have been built for
apple frost risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art Degatano built these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, again, these maps, if you click
on these maps, they'll blow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't, at this point, zoom right
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the resolution of these maps is not
high resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't zoom right in on these
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can select either Red Delicious,
Empire, or McIntosh with this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a grape bud hardiness tool that's
experimental that Art Degatano built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is based on research out of
Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three varieties that are available
here are Concord, Cab Franc, and Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there are these maps that show
the modified hardiness temperature here,
[SPEAKER_00]: bud injury potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's none right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I accessed this very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a chart showing the max
min.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the hardiness line for
Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the lowest temperature since
July 1 map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about as big as these maps get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about the highest res that
you'll get of this map on the web right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Art Degatano with Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences, he's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: director of the Northeast Regional Climate
Center, built this soil temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm for us to estimate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are planning, hopefully, to use these
data in a weed development model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Tony DiTomasso, Abby Seaman,
and oh, I'm having a senior moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Mike Ryan or Mark Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are potentially going to be developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, soil
temperature and knowing soil temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: could potentially be used for planting
date estimation for certain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil temperature map is available
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to nua.cornell.edu and go to
crop management, it should be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, tell Betsy or Greg,
who are in front of you, they know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll show you a couple of tools
that are actually programmed in NUA for
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Apple evapotranspiration
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's modeling the use of soil water by
the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you would select the
weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This screen capture was done last year
before we had the state selection in this
[SPEAKER_00]: utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd select the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, it defaults to the current date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to put the green tip
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll estimate that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know that for your orchard
block, you would get better results,
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate results, obviously,
if you enter that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put your row spacing between
row spacing and the trees per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if you know your trees per
acre, you don't really have to do the row
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing and between row spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a selection for the age
of the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes 0, 1, 2, 3 years and then
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll hit calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the calculate button is usually
here under this water balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the table will build.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green row here is the green tip date.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the current date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green row here is the current date.
[SPEAKER_00]: In blue are the past dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in brown are the forecast days pushed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I think they go six to seven
days into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainfall right now, we can't really get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever looked at a forecast,
it's usually what are the chances of rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the percent prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell you how much is going to
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rainfall will inform how many
gallons per acre have fallen on the
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard, how much irrigation you've
applied can be entered here if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your irrigation record, and then the daily
water balance in gallons per acre and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cumulative water balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the perspective is this final number is
the number that you need to be concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tree has drawn out 10,526 gallons
per acre, what you need to do then is to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the water holding capacity of your
soil, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they recommend is to start
irrigation if you're at, if the tree has
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn off 10% of that water holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their earmark benchmark target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would need to do if you've got
an irrigated orchard, you figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: much water you're putting out on your
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flow rate of the emitters and the
number of emitters per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can figure out how much water you
can put on per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use this calculation to do
that so that what these guys are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model has been built by Alan
Lacso's research on apple physiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: Terence Robinson's work with Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Terence has a postdoc, Jaumi Lordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually Jaumi's slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jaumi is now working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hope to develop an actual app
with this where you can put in emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil type, et cetera, and will improve
this model on NUA accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other model that I wanted to walk
through or tool that I wanted to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: through with you today is the apple
carbohydrate thinning model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This model is perhaps the biggest reason,
I think, why the network has grown so
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly over the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This model has revolutionized thinning in
orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer, okay, I'm gonna put this
much growth regulator out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an ounce of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put that in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the grower pours himself or
herself an ounce of vodka.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chuck that down and they get on their
sprayer and they go out and they spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I borrowed that from Dan Donahue who works
in the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, I mean, it just gives you an
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinning was like, okay, has it been
cloudy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna be hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the trees like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which variety, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: This model has been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's built on research by Alan
Lacso in tree fruit physiology and work by
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of horticulturalists in the
Northeast that have tested this over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would do, you'd first access
the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a screenshot showing you
how the map is first that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd select the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather station, the date,
and hit continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the results tab will start to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here they're gonna ask you to put in
your green tip date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we can estimate that for you,
but it's always better if you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: biological data in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bloom date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hit calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the apple carbohydrate results
tabulate and build.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thinning table builds from,
let me go back, from the green tip date
[SPEAKER_00]: here down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar to the irrigation table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green row, this is the current date
that you just selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rows in blue above are the past
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rows in brown below are what's
forecast into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the thinning recommendation is in
this column.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're either gonna increase the
thinner rate by a certain amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the thinner rate by a certain
amount, or apply a standard rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below this, the apple carbohydrate
balance charts and builds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I usually tell audiences is if you
think about it from the standpoint of
[SPEAKER_00]: being female and having to carry a baby to
term, which is very near and dear to my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart because I had twins, you have to eat
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a good carbohydrate
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the tree is starving and you put a
thinner on, it's probably gonna shed a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of that fruit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't, it probably wants to
drop some of that load anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's never as simple as that,
as you know, because they're plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so much more complex than us
humans could ever think of being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the carbohydrate balance is in
surplus, the opposite you would think
[SPEAKER_00]: would hold true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take more thinner to thin them
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is there's a lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lag in the memory of the tree
and a lag in all of these processes within
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in any case, it's made thinning a lot
less of a, I gotta have that shot of vodka
[SPEAKER_00]: before I can get on the tractor and put
that growth regulator out on my orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the considerations that we tell
people going forward is we have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: good solar radiation data from the weather
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's out of range, we will silence the
station because we don't want the garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: in, garbage out thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want people to be accessing a
model when the data going into it is bad
[SPEAKER_00]: or could give them erroneous results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to thin varieties are still gonna be
hard to thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, people need to use it
within the context of the thinning
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines in the area or region state
that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next section of my talk,
I'm just gonna talk about how have we
[SPEAKER_00]: built the capacity of NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, the biggest part in that or
the piece of that was partnering with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast Regional Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They house our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help us with model programming into
the PI design tools that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help us with some data quality
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide meteorological expertise and
guidance, which we, living in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological side of things, we really don't
have a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing too is that they're
interested in agricultural applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they weren't interested in
that, it would be a harder sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have also helped us with automated
reports that we wanted to generate to send
[SPEAKER_00]: to people when we know that their weather
station is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, when we implemented this,
I thought, oh my gosh, everybody's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be so mad because we're, you know,
hassling them with these emails,
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them their station is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality has been I have gotten
more compliments on that than I've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody saying, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you stop bugging me with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really been a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Rainwise Incorporated
Weather Stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the About Weather Stations
menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this menu now because
we've put together more links for the
[SPEAKER_00]: troubleshooting guidelines on how to
replace a battery, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are solar powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the solar panel that powers the
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leaf wetness sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're mounted on the north side over
here under the tipping bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the radio antenna.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data is radio signal transmitted to a
computer or a box inside the house or
[SPEAKER_00]: barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we either use the internet protocol,
the file transfer protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be working on that API that I
mentioned earlier for one minute data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Rainwise also has a few products
in their premium system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a frost alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've developed things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also send your data to Weather
Underground and other weather service
[SPEAKER_00]: providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is both really exciting for me and
almost overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chart's only through, I believe,
July of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a chance to upgrade this or
update this to include 2016 and the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last seven years, we've seen
significant growth in the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: weather stations connected to NOAA because
of partnering with all these other states
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green is when the New Jersey State
Climatology Mesonet joined up with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray is University of Massachusetts,
which I must say, we were zero funded in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a big part of still being here
and being relevant is because at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, Vermont and Massachusetts wanted to
join forces with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really helped us immensely in
terms of our funding base and keeping us
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the airports, for those of you who
are familiar with weather data enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the microclimate around that
weather station can have a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the weather data, we do have a
relative humidity correction factor for
[SPEAKER_00]: our airport data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a leaf wetness estimate
for those locations because typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: meteorologists are not collecting that
type of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have those types of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our list of partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting that this slide is getting
more and more full all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think probably the most exciting
thing for me is that the Minnesota Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers and the North Carolina Apple
Growers Associations are paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: statewide membership for all of Minnesota
and all of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked them repeatedly,
are you OK with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if a vegetable grower, Steve,
put up a weather station?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, no, we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want because we want this
network in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty exciting dealing with apple
growers that, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: have shown a great deal of altruism
through NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really quite rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new partners that we're currently
grooming, so to speak, EnviroWeather,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a similar system to NOAA that's
based out of Michigan State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are now currently receiving their data
and looking at it to make sure it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be compatible with our NOAA database
and how that collaboration is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure because, again,
they have their own EnviroWeather and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are we going to share our tools
and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be an exciting year
looking to build that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two state climatology mesonets.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in North Carolina and one is in
Delaware that I've been in communication
[SPEAKER_00]: with trying to enrich our network with
their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State Mesonet has put up,
I believe, 125 or 150 state-of-the-art
[SPEAKER_00]: weather instruments all across New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were in response to Lee and
Sandy that devastated the coast and up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are FEMA dollars that are paying
for this network to go into New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with them to see about
getting that data set into NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are partnering with Climate Smart
Farming and seeing where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we collaborate with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just embarked on a prototype or
a, what is that, you know, a beta test of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting data to the University of Maine so
that they can run some of our data through
[SPEAKER_00]: their ag radar models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our stakeholder priorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So top priority, sustainable funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sustainable funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many of you know how important that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to have a responsive web design
so that if you're on a smartphone,
[SPEAKER_00]: NOAA is going to behave a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be pinching and pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have more stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked into using the National
Digital Forecast Database of gridded data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some issues with that,
most notably leaf wetness for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathology models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at developing apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers would very much like for us to
remember their planting dates and their
[SPEAKER_00]: green tip dates and their bloom dates so
they don't have to have a little cheat
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet and enter it every time that they
use the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: More models, more tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Station maintenance and troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done quite a bit of that on that the
past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And promoting awareness, which is why I'm
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We held a planning meeting so there's a
state coordinator for every state that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time we had our planning
meeting, there were six state members of
[SPEAKER_00]: NOAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they wanted responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our objectives after our meeting,
we came away with responsive web design,
[SPEAKER_00]: a set of premium products to build some
sustainable funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtual stations, that's using that
digital database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wouldn't it be nice to have a
developer sandbox?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, you could go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple pollen tube growth model,
here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a developer could go in,
set up some parameters, put in some
[SPEAKER_00]: language, hit go, and the tool would be
created on the fly and then you'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: this tool that you could validate and
change and implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue sky thinking, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who know me are all like,
Julie, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right, so coming down to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having gotten older and just having
gotten a smartphone, which I used to hide
[SPEAKER_00]: my flip phone when I was out talking to
growers because they knew I was doing NOAA
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been doing a lot of other digital
computer stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did, I got a smartphone and Steve
Valentino, who was working for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's just gone on to grad school in
molecular biotechnology stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very compelling area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he was working for me,
he was doing all the troubleshooting,
[SPEAKER_00]: weather station maintenance stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, Julie, I don't even
worry about if it opens into another tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep all the, on my browser,
on my phone, I keep all these things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I have all these tiles and I
can just go up, down, through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took a picture of my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you, this is a picture of my
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got the, you are NOAA is a
blog that we set up because I was told,
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie, you've got to set up a blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get a Twitter account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do all this Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got the degree day calculator,
the Apple disease models, and the NOAA
[SPEAKER_00]: homepage on my browser all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just hit reload.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now reload.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I mean, for some of you,
it's like, yeah, duh, I knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we been doing in terms of
just weather data research?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned about the soil temperature
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those this year, I believe they put out
actual sensors in specific soils they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to use to validate that estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some precipitation, solar
radiation, temperature, and humidity data
[SPEAKER_00]: quality control research that's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to get funding to get
the gridded data developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another grant that's going to
go in that I'm part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully NOAA would benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did some work on leaf wetness
estimation and found that an hour with
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity above 90% would be a
good enough estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of just a little ballpark
of what we're using right now and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the research that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of model development,
there's the Apple pollen tube growth
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thinning model,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a value to organic producers who
would be applying lime sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so they'd be applying lime sulfur to
thin off blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to kill the blossom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't want to kill the blossom
unless the fruit has set or it's at a
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable stage to be killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I rely on people like
Keith Yoder at Virginia Tech and Greg Peck
[SPEAKER_00]: to inform this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping we might be able to get
some funding to develop this model here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the near term, Tony DiTomasso in Soil
and Crop Science, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: is looking at a weed management model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy Lamb, who's in this room,
got a grant from the New York Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: Viability Institute to develop woody
ornamental insect degree day tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the New York Berry Growers Association
funded us to develop some berry insect and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, we've got a wish list of
over 40 models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's only 38 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we did two of these this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, some impacts and
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NUA is transforming this weather data
into knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers can share all this weather data
through the cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have forecasts that are pushing
things out five days, making it an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things growers are saying,
I use the NUA site almost every day early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orchard was largely scab free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apple scab is a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time in several years,
the manager relied heavily on NUA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two New Jersey apple growers reported
the best thinning results ever in 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: using the apple carbohydrate thinning
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So better IPM, reduced pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, people, growth regulators are
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced pesticide use, improved
environmental protection, better crop
[SPEAKER_00]: management, improved crop quality,
improved yield, enhanced decision support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chart, nah, you guys aren't really
that concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys aren't concerned about this
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just says, yeah, growers agree or
strongly agree that NUA helps IPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce sprays, improve spray timing,
alert pest risk, and enhance IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before we launched our new
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was even when we were on the
clunky old website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're experiencing over two million
page views per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a page view is when the end user is
spending 30 minutes or more on a page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2007, growers reported they could
save on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are primarily apple and grape
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, 19,500 per year costs and
prevent about a quarter of a million per
[SPEAKER_00]: year in crop loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, high value horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we asked, would you recommend NUA
to farmers, 99% said yes, they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NUA, access to IPM decision support,
and IPM is all about sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: management of pests using methods that
minimize environmental health and economic
[SPEAKER_00]: risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking plant disease epidemiology
research, insect phenology research,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant phenology research, and crop
management research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're creating phenology models and
forecasts that benefit the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're benefiting the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing a pretty good job in
fruit and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do better in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy's lining the yellow brick road on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see where the future is in terms
of field crops and livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with that, I will say thank you
for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take any questions you might
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
