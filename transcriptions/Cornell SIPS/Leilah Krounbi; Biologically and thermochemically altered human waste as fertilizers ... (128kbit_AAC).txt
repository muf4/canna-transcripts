[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Layla Kurnby, and I'm going
to talk to you about a project that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working on regarding biologically and
thermochemically altered human waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: converting it into fertilizers and soil
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became involved in this project through
a broader initiative that was put out by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Gates Foundation called the Reinvent
the Toilet Challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sort of very low on the totem pole
in terms of people that were involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a project called the Climate
Foundation, which was awarded one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: prizes for developing a pyrolysis-based
toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a toilet that takes a solid waste
and converts it into charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they contacted Johannes Levin,
and they asked him to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I somehow got involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of this call was to generate
waste management systems that are off the
[SPEAKER_00]: grid, so basically non-water-based waste
management systems, which is particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: important in developing countries where
sometimes the population density in
[SPEAKER_00]: informal settlements is so high you can't
even put in infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, one of the objectives is to
remove germs and recover valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, such as energy, clean water,
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where Johannes and I came into
the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working on converting or assessing
whether the charcoal was a valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource with regards to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all project proposals had to
demonstrate that their plan cost less than
[SPEAKER_00]: $0.05 per user per day, and it was
supposed to promote sustainable services
[SPEAKER_00]: in poor urban settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a context in which I've been
working on my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the physical context in which
I worked for about a year in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from Kibera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most, I guess,
renowned or nefarious, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: slums in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the biggest, and it's not the
worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a common sight because waste
management is generally by just open
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal, so open defecation, open
dumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have is a problem with an
excess of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, this problem with an excess
of nutrients in urban areas is common all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all understand that there's a
decoupling between the nutrients generated
[SPEAKER_00]: in concentrated areas of human environment
or where animals are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where animals are grown and areas where
crops are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even in the Northeast,
you have this problem where areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: there are large dairy farms, you have a
large concentration of nutrients in areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where people are growing maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're applying tons of mineral
fertilizer because there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: decoupling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly prominent in
developing countries where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely no way, so there's no waste
treatment at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes into the ambient environment,
and it just stays in the waterways around
[SPEAKER_00]: Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this problem of excess, it manifests
as excess pathogens and health problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: excess nutrients loading into the water
and excess greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas over in Western Kenya,
where a lot of the maize is grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the opposite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have soil fertility deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't afford to buy fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have access to them,
which result in yield deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they cause human nutritional
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see what a little bit of
fertilizer can do for a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a maize plot that's not receiving
any fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a maize crop that's receiving
only 80 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we could just try to couple
these systems, take some of this excess,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it here, we might really be on our
way with helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our collaborators on the ground in
Kenya that were also involved in this
[SPEAKER_00]: project are a latrine project started by
some MIT business students that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized a business opportunity in waste
management in Islam called Sanergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their business model is to sanitize
waste by collecting it, transforming it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're in the business of
transforming waste and generating either
[SPEAKER_00]: energy or some valuable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're located in Nairobi,
Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their latrine system, it's called a
urine diversion system, where the solid
[SPEAKER_00]: waste is collected and one portion of the
liquid waste in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important when you're
sanitizing waste, because most
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitization processes involve heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are some that don't,
like anaerobic digestion or fatty acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that Lars Anjanitz's lab is working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our method, thermochemically
transforming waste and also compostation,
[SPEAKER_00]: they necessitate heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want as low of a water content
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what you get are two resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the solid portion of the waste and
the liquid portion of the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have different benefits when
they're processed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at present, Sanergy is only processing
waste through compostation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of where we came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to see if pyrolysis was
maybe actually a more efficient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at present, I just downloaded this
yesterday, they have 932 active toilets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell the latrines to people that then
operate them by pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like $0.15 to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have about 50,000 users a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use that number to
calculate some basic basically what the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential nutrient recovery would be from
these 50,000, I call them fresh life
[SPEAKER_00]: poopers, because the latrines are called
fresh life latrines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's somebody using a fresh life
latrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's generating on average 50 grams of
dry human waste per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The values are all over in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we measured at Sanergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we measured coming out of the
latrines based on the people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that 50 grams of dry human waste a
day based on the nitrogen phosphorous and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium content that I measured,
we can generate about 1.4 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, 0.5 grams of phosphorus,
0.5 grams of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the urine, people generally excrete
about 1 liter a day, which on a mass per
[SPEAKER_00]: volume basis is about 1% nitrogen,
0.7% phosphorus, and 2% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 10 grams of mineral nitrogen,
7 grams of phosphorus, 2 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we add that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to convert that into how many
farms we can fertilize per year from those
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 fresh life poopers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we get over one year, if we just
account for the nitrogen in the urine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we know is a plant available,
we get about 183 tons per year just from
[SPEAKER_00]: those 50,000 people, 155 tons of
phosphorus, 46 tons of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, we can fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the fertilizer nutrient
recommendations from the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that that's very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to understand that people are
applying zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 90 kilograms is a lot for a farmer in
Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fertilize over 2,000 farms a year
just using the waste generated from these
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another question is, well, why
pyrolysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many other ways to sanitize
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do anaerobic digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this, incinerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about pyrolysis is that,
first of all, I think you understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are interested in it because of its
efficiency with regards to energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of exothermic to a certain point
under certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in this context, it's
important to consider that right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanergy, they're just using composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are windrows at Sanergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to get, for thermophilic
compostation to work, you have to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 60 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nairobi is actually kind of a cold
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like high up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rains a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been told that they can rarely
get above 55 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to leave it out for about nine
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with pyrolysis, these temperatures
assure sanitization in a very short time,
[SPEAKER_00]: within a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the goal of the Reinvent the
Toilet project, the people we were working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, was to convert two tons of waste a
day into char.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the anoxic conditions, so pyrolysis is
like incineration with no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anoxic conditions reduce carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon becomes reduced and less
microbial available or more persistent in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it concentrates nutrients because what
goes off during the process is carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a concentration of the plant
essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires, obviously, less time and less
land than compostation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show this data just
because I know that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with biosolids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not for biosolids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not biosolids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not mixed with industrial waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to also show you that the
problem with pollutants in Kenya is not
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just with regards to heavy metals,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not measure xenobiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any ways, with pyrolysis, it wouldn't
be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with regards to heavy metals,
just leaving the waste in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: increases the concentration of lead and
arsenic relative to treating it
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took this and treated it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have much lower lead concentrations
than the compost that was sitting out for
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because of the ambient
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very polluted in Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the treatment methods that I'll be
talking about in this presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them biological.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological sanitization, which is
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other methods for biological
sanitization, like anaerobic digestion,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about thermochemical
methods, including torrefaction at 200
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this doesn't really alter the
chemistry of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mostly serves to desiccate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still anoxic and considered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pyrolysis, which is thermochemical
transformation between 300 and 700 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research questions that I'm going
to address right now are, let's start with
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which properties of treated human waste
have agronomic value?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it about this material that
might improve crop yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is it the surface area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something, you know, rhizobia?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't test all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just interested in getting an idea
of, is there anything valuable about this
[SPEAKER_00]: material?
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, I wanted to try to
convert some of the agronomic properties
[SPEAKER_00]: into a monetary value relative to the
price of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to quantify not just the
nutrients, but also what I considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be soil conditioning properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also interested in whether the
nitrogen and the phosphorus is available
[SPEAKER_00]: in these different amendments in soils,
and whether it differs across soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I incubate these amendments in
soils, what happens to nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus availability?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to that end, I incubated them in
soils that differed in pH and texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my third objective, having a general
idea that most of the nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste was probably not plant available,
I wanted to see if I could incorporate the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and urine into pyrolyzed human
waste to produce a high-value soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment, knowing that nitrogen is,
first and foremost, the most limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there are so many other
limiting nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the low-hanging fruit of
taking care of a lot of plant issues is
[SPEAKER_00]: adding nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried to develop a process for
precipitating nitrogen from urine into
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolyzed human waste, not relying on
necessarily the chemical properties of the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste, but just trying to create a
solution environment in which that could
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, my first objective, determine the
agronomic properties and values of human
[SPEAKER_00]: solid waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say agronomic properties,
I'm talking about things like plant
[SPEAKER_00]: essential nutrients, like phosphorus,
magnesium, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also talking about properties like
liming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this material consume acidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have carbonate embedded in the
matrix?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about nutrient retention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sorbing calcium?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, is it a source of stable carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And stable carbon is important,
we know, from soil health, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually affects these things,
liming and nutrient retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is important from an
environmental perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to mitigate the oxidation of
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at this point, the waste is just
going into the ambient environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: completely oxidizing or being converted to
methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would like to stabilize some of
that carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to take this weak little
plant, add a little charcoal, and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice-looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so to start, I had to create
some human waste charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and some people, not this guy,
but some other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I took this from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we collected some waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the buckets that you collect
the solid waste in from the toilets and
[SPEAKER_00]: the jerry cans with the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want you to know that the human
waste is very different than biosolids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a very high concentration of
bacteria, because it undergoes digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like pig waste, because it's
actually, because of the way that people
[SPEAKER_00]: use the latrines, they put sawdust as a
cover material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mixed with sawdust, like mostly
eucalyptus, at a one-to-one dry volumetric
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit more like animal,
like cow manure, almost, like the texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to sun-dry it to get it
below 35% moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we're thermochemically
transforming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have as low of a water
content as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pyrolyzed it in a unit that actually a
key was sent to the collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did some analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those analyses included we extracted
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, we extracted nitrogen
with potassium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to get the plant-available
nitrogen, not just the total nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just did a malic extraction of
these macronutrients and these
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple, just to get a sort of a proxy
for what the nutrient availability would
[SPEAKER_00]: be in this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at the soil conditioning
properties, which again, I determined
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the liming potential,
which I calculated as the calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate equivalency using a back
titration with sodium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tried to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically used the cation exchange
capacity to assess how much of the base
[SPEAKER_00]: cations in the material could be retained
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to quantify that, turn that
into a metric that actually is just in
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milligrams per kilogram of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tried to quantify the stable
carbon expected to remain after 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it BC plus 100 using a metric,
which is the molar concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen to organic carbon, which is sort
of like a metric for the aromatic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: versus aliphatic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the organic carbon that you would
expect to remain in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this top graph, the y-axis,
is the nutrient concentration in each
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendments being the compost, the
torrified waste, the two pyrolyzed waste
[SPEAKER_00]: at two different degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients being the extractable
nitrogen, these micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CEC is the contribution of CEC
towards nutrients by retaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, calcium, magnesium that's
already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a calculation for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't show it, but I can show
anyone that's interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I can see here is that as I
increase with highest heating temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more nutrients because the
nutrients become concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, there's a yield loss,
a mass loss as the product is subjected to
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 500 degrees, I actually only am
retaining 30% of the original mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of what's lost is carbon,
oxygen, and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutrients are concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, even though I've still lost
maybe 70% of the carbon or hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen, I still have 70%, according to
this metric, of what could be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent carbon in this material
compared to all the other materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in conclusion, the pyrolyzed human
waste at 500 degrees, it contains about
[SPEAKER_00]: 15% more nutrients than torrified waste,
100% more nutrients than composted waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: and about 600% more stable carbon than
either of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can translate into a monetary
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to calculate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to calculate, to put a dollar sign,
I just took fertilizer and lime prices
[SPEAKER_00]: from different sites, from this really
nice site that has prices for fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: in East Africa, as well as international
prices and good old Alibaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also calculated the, I tried to put
a dollar percent on the stable carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: using discount prices from a World Bank
report that I used 20 different countries
[SPEAKER_00]: to average out what a carbon discount rate
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of money per amendment is
basically the summed value of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic components, including the
nutrients, including the lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the stable carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I mean, as you guys know with
prices, especially when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about Africa International over time,
there's a huge sensitivity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment value on the market prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the quartile values are really all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just looked at the median market
price for all of these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I got is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I just want to say,
so the y-axis is US dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's US dollars per ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per ton of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's per ton of feed stock,
per ton of the initial waste before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's been normalized to what I
call the yield, like the mass yield coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the treatment process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you can see is as the material
is subject to higher heating, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: mass lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that decreases the value of the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's what the waste processing
plant sees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel they have less material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting less money because they
have this mass loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is US dollars per ton of amendment of
the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the farmer sees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give a farmer a bag of this,
this is what they see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see all this phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a very high value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also not paying for the
overhead costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to demonstrate that there
are two ways to put a dollar value on this
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either what is in the hands of the
farmer that would otherwise have been
[SPEAKER_00]: buying fertilizer, or what is in the hands
of the waste processing that has to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are just the farmer,
you'd much rather have the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature material because it has more
nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the waste processing plant,
you'd much rather process this material
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're getting more money per unit
mass that you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to point out that the big
difference here is just between the
[SPEAKER_00]: thermochemical treatments and the
biological treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's because the compost is
not really like the feedstock anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been contaminated with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very high concentration of iron,
aluminum, and manganese because it's sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of been mixed in the windrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the 200 degree material is the
most similar to the feedstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that the composting
process fundamentally changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they all fundamentally change the
material in an undesirable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, so in Africa, and by the way,
these are fertilizer prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices through which these were
generated were taken from the African
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer prices, not the international,
although it's all on the same website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in Africa, a ton of human solid
waste processed at 500 degrees would give
[SPEAKER_00]: me $245, mostly from phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the value of thermochemically treated
waste is more than four times the
[SPEAKER_00]: composted waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just wanted to show this just to
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the international prices are and to
show that the value is really different
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the value of your waste looks
different if you're in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can buy fertilizer prices using
the international, on the international
[SPEAKER_00]: market, or whether you're in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a 500 degree waste in Africa,
you might think that that bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: that ton of material is saving you $245,
whereas here it's $61.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's $61?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I even bother?
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus are disproportionately higher
in Africa than some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, pyrolyzed waste at 500
degrees has the highest nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and soil conditioning
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not very impressive,
but if I just generated an extractable NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: value, I have zero nitrogen, 0.8%
phosphorus, and 1% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, when you talk about organic
amendments, usually they're presented in
[SPEAKER_00]: the total elemental concentration,
not in P205.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or K20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, this is not that bad for the
extractable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has 100% higher nutrients than the
compost, 50% higher than the torrified
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I want to talk about the money
that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what Sanergy sees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if I was processing waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of money I'd be making if
I was collecting this waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are collecting the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are selling the compost and the
urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what they're selling
it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But according to my estimations,
those 50% of 50,000 people using their
[SPEAKER_00]: toilets who are generating 50 grams of dry
waste a day at a 30% mass recovery for the
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 degree treatment only give me 0.75
tons of waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is the price per ton,
I only get $190 every day from those
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I use the 200 degree processing
method, I have 90% mass recovery because
[SPEAKER_00]: torrefaction only dehydrates the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming I've already dried it
down to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 50 grams is dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I get $582 a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think these values, for a program
that's trying to implement this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention, you have to really consider
who these prices are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they for the processing plant or the
farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my second objective, now we've gone
over this agronomic value, now we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at do different human solid waste
amendments affect soil nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus in different ways in different
soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I incubated them, these amendments,
in soils differing in texture and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my hypotheses were that I
would see a trade-off with the available
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and the available phosphorus with
highest heating temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of literature to demonstrate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, well, I would surely see
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd lower the products that were
subjected to lower temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the compost and the torrified waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would probably generate a lot of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the pyrolyzed waste, especially
the 500 degree, would probably have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phosphorus, definitely low respiration,
stabilized carbon, and would probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: a high pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to see what would happen if
I incubated the 500 degree material,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochar, with urine, assuming that a
lot of this nitrogen isn't available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably have to offset the
lack of nitrogen with a mineral source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the literature, biochar has been
noted to accelerate nitrification through
[SPEAKER_00]: different mechanisms, by having a liming
effect, by sorbing phenolic compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: by providing surfaces for autotrophic
nitrifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been noted to increase the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the nitrification process is
exacerbating a soil acidity, which could
[SPEAKER_00]: lower the pH, I think that adding biochar
with that mineral nitrogen should
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the pH, generate a lot of
nitrate, which is plant available,
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep the phosphorus available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I thought, that I would not
see a negative effect of adding this
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral nitrogen on soil acidity with
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought that in terms of the
interaction between the amendments I was
[SPEAKER_00]: adding and the soils, I thought that at
lower HHT, its highest heating
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the amendments treated at
lower temperatures, and the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: texture, so the sandy soil would probably
promote greater carbon and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that the stable carbon is much
higher at the higher temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in sandier soils, the inclusion of
this amendment would probably increase
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area, allow for more microbes,
more microbial activity, so I expected
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also expected that there would be
greater phosphorus availability when I add
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher heating temperature chars in
acidic soils, so that they would buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH, maintaining phosphorus
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, me and Harold Benes,
we collected some soils in Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a wild goose chase,
finding two soils that had a low pH and a
[SPEAKER_00]: sandy texture, and two soils that had a
higher pH and a loamy texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a clay texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected them from three different
watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Lower Yala watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mid Yala watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Nyando watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have been very well
characterized by ICRAF and people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked here before, like Doris
Soltouris and David Gadegna and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: Dawit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're well-traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they know some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the soil that we collected from
Lower Yala was an Oltisol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are both Oltisols,
according to the Kenyan soil map,
[SPEAKER_00]: although they were very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a semantic Oltisol, like a sandy
textured soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I performed XRD on all these soils,
so I sort of got the fingerprint,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mineral fingerprint, had a lot of
kaolinite in the eye light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a very red soil, and it had a
coarser texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a clay loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil here was actually a mollisol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a vertisol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a black cotton soil,
and they used to grow a lot of cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an alkaline pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had montmorillonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaolinite and a lot of oxides had a high
manganese concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a soil that was kind of in the same
vicinity, we were lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually got a... Oh, this is not an
enceptosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I totally messed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an enceptosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have a lot of profile
development, but it did have a sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a fairly non-acidic pH,
and it had a very high concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractable manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the soils we use in our
incubation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the incubation was like a jar within a
jar with another little jar that trapped
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon dioxide that was coming out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is we incubated four
different amendments, the biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: processed waste, the torrified waste,
these two pyrolyzed wastes, and four
[SPEAKER_00]: different soils, these four soils that I
just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did a second experiment where I
incubated the pyrolyzed waste with urine
[SPEAKER_00]: in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the pyrolyzed waste with urine,
just the urine and then nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amendments were added at about a
10 ton per hectare ratio, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: added on a weight basis, just 0.5% by
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they weren't normalized to carbon or
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just added on a weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the urine was added in accordance with
what I would call the resource
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of urine to feces generated
from a fresh life latrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just took the proportion of human
waste and urine generated on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, and I added that in that same
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added it in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added about 500 kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the urine also contained phosphorus,
about 50 kilograms of phosphorus per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had enough jars to where I could
destructively sample at four time points,
[SPEAKER_00]: days 0, 7, 30, and 100, during which I
tested this trap for carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I extracted these soils, the whole
entire sample, with potassium chloride to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the mineral nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph is kind of a summary of
what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the y-axis, you can see this is the
phosphorus, the difference of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: between day 100 and day 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis, I have the mineral nitrogen
concentration, the difference between day
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 and day 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shapes of these series, they
correspond to these amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This upside down triangle is at 200
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diamond is at 300 degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This forward triangle is 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: The box is a compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the star is the unamended soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the magnitude of the series is
representative of the magnitude of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the ulticell, the sandy
ulticell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is that incepticell that has the
high manganese concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I see is that the lower
temperature, indeed, there is a trade-off
[SPEAKER_00]: between highest heating temperature,
200, 300, 500, and nitrogen and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that doesn't really follow
through with the compost, which I also
[SPEAKER_00]: would have expected to be down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I think the compost is
fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been altered with all the soil
that's been added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it behaves just like the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you see that the shape of this
series is much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the nitrogen has been generated
through the mineralization of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, not necessarily of this
amendment, but in the whole treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amendment promoted the mineralization
of a lot of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the series is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The series is so big, and that's why
there's so much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this amendment, it did not promote
a lot of mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorus was not immobilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a huge difference
between the results in these two soil
[SPEAKER_00]: types, even though they are of a similar
pH, and even though they are of a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just because of the
mineralogy of the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I do see this trade-off between
nitrogen and phosphorus with highest
[SPEAKER_00]: heating temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a function of the carbon
mineralization, at least in this soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost did not compare to the
torrified waste, even though they were at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the explanation might be
the dissolved organic carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in these amendments,
which happen to be much higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: an order of magnitude higher, for this 200
degree torrified waste rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's probably what explains
some of these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a farmer had access to at least one
of these, whether this or this,
[SPEAKER_00]: he might get something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he just applies the 500 degree
material, the difference in phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the control soil adds up to
about 22 kilograms of phosphorus per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these conversions were done assuming a
15 centimeter depth and a bulk density of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he just had this torrified waste,
he'd get about 64 kilograms of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare relative to the control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that the difference
between the results in this soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a similar texture and pH to this
soil, is the concentration of ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: oxalate extractable amorphous oxides,
aluminum, iron, and manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 2% by weight in this soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's 0.5% in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there may have been phosphorus
fixation here, whereas there may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial immobilization here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second thing I wanted to look at
was I wanted to see if I added the biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: with the mineral nitrogen, what happens to
soil acidity and to phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I noticed is that adding
biochar with urine did not increase
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrification, or at least didn't increase
the amount of extractable nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not significantly different in
this soil, in this sandy ultusol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also adding the biochar with urine did
not help in terms of the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH was very much acidified with this
urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biochar was even a little worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, so there was no difference in nitrate
or pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratios were probably extremely off in
terms of the amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, the phosphorus availability was
not inhibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same graph that you just
saw with the y-axis was phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between day 100 and day 0,
mineral nitrogen day 100 and day 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the series that I had presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two series are this is the
biochar with urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that obviously we have a
lot of nitrogen because we've just added a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biochar doesn't affect the nitrogen
concentrations after 100 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phosphorus is not negatively
affected by that exacerbated acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a lot of phosphorus
that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although in this soil, with the high
manganese concentrations, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments performed very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the urine by itself wasn't that
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very big difference between
the soil types and the nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely saw a trade-off between
nitrogen and phosphorus with highest
[SPEAKER_00]: heating temperature, but only among the
thermochemically treated waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a function of carbon respiration
predicted by amendment dissolved organic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture did not play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not even pH necessarily,
but rather the concentration of amorphous
[SPEAKER_00]: oxides or ammonium extractable oxides.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I added this pyrolyzed waste with
urine, did not enhance this extractable
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, did not mitigate acidification,
although phosphorus did remain unaffected,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this is a good amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pyrolyzed waste in urine is a good
amendment, although we still obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with the acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone over some agronomic
properties and values.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at nitrogen and phosphorus
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to talk about whether
we can increase the value by incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: the mineral nitrogen in urine into the
pyrolyzed waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just adding it as a separate
liquid, but sort of intercalating the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen into the matrix so we can apply
it as a granular fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to that end, we've been trying to
develop a process for precipitating urine
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen into pyrolyzed waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urine is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal in combining mineral nitrogen
in urine with biochar, again, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasize that most of the nitrogen in
household waste is in urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of this nitrogen, about 90%,
is mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plant available, whereas the nitrogen
in solid waste is very little and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: generally organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the species of nitrogen urine is urea,
which will hydrolyze immediately in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a container that is used often with
urease into ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that process, the pH will go
from about 6 to 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 9, you'll end up having about half
ammonia and half ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why urine can smell really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you talk about loading
nitrogen onto the biochar matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with two different forms of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with ionic ammonia,
and then you're dealing with very reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, which can be dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: in water, or it can be in a gaseous form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go over a few of the
mechanisms which are of interest in trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just have nonspecific
physisorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just have nitrogen, ammonium or
ammonia, just sort of being trapped in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pore spaces of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that biochar is renowned for
its surface area for microporosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just be retaining nitrogen
through occlusion in pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only caveat is that since the
diameter of ammonia is about 3 angstroms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have pores that are of a
similar magnitude, maybe 10 to 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 20 angstroms, or else these van der
Waals forces are not going to be effective
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I don't know what the
microporosity of mychar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming it's mesoporous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be very important of a
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another factor that we understand from
soils is cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a retention of ionic
ammonium, also weak bonds onto protonated
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxyl groups on anions, maybe sulfur,
maybe phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also have retention of ammonia
through strong sorption on bronsted acid
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we know that ammonia has its
free electron pairs, that can either
[SPEAKER_00]: receive a proton, and that is a strong
sorption, or it can actually interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with, for example, in this carboxylic
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxygens have created a dipole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very nucleophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is electrophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this ammonia can essentially bond
in this carboxylic group and form an amine
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is strong sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no longer extractable nitrogen,
but it could probably be easily
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralized in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are different mechanisms that we
can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I was mostly interested in just
pushing this to the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, forget all these surface
functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to precipitate an ammonium
salt on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get a whole bunch of
nitrogen on the surface that we can just
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ammonium salts, you have many ammonium
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have struvite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that people have looked
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Struvite is ammonium magnesium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it often just precipitates in
wastewater streams, precipitates in pig
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with some of these other
ammonium salts is that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to import this counter ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're dealing with pyrolysis,
we have a counter ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bicarbonate because we have carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is a waste product of
pyrolysis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since urine is a pH of 9, if we inject
the carbon dioxide into the urine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can speciate it as bicarbonate,
maybe probably not as carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just saying that I thought,
well, bicarbonate, maybe that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: counter ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anyways, we don't want to spend
more money on some of these other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, but we're just going to go
back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through some of these
sorption mechanisms and look at what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now we're going to look at
unloading via physisorption and cation
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, sort of like Lewis acid base
interactions on oxygenated functional
[SPEAKER_00]: groups on the 500 degree material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talk about sorption mechanisms,
I want to maximize all the portfolio of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I have different types of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this heterogeneous surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on this y-axis, I have the surface
area of different human waste that's
[SPEAKER_00]: treated at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the compost, the torrified
waste, the 300, 400, 500, 600,
700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the surface area, meter square per
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it goes up with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the cation exchange capacity,
millimoles of charge per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes down because as the material
is heated, you have a loss of these
[SPEAKER_00]: functional groups with heating
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I'm trying to diversify the
portfolio of options for sorption,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into this sweet spot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a little of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go with the 500 degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say, I'm focusing on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm going to use to load up
the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because look, I can take this value,
the surface area value, and I can convert
[SPEAKER_00]: it to how many potential moles of ammonia
I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do this conversion,
maybe I can even get an increase in 4.3%
of the surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get an increase of mineral nitrogen
on the surface just through fizzy
[SPEAKER_00]: sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you have to remember that this
requires micropores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't know if I have not yet
calculated this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll put that on hold for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of electrostatic sorption
mechanisms, it doesn't seem like the CEC
[SPEAKER_00]: is promising me a lot of retention of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of ammonium I can retain,
so this should be ammonium, is only about
[SPEAKER_00]: increases my mineral nitrogen content by
0.31% point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't look very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we just look at the total
potential of sorbing nitrogen through
[SPEAKER_00]: these acid-base interactions, whether
strong sorption or weak sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say, I just want to look
at the oxygenated functional groups as a
[SPEAKER_00]: proxy for how much I can even get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I have this FTIR spectra from
wood and oxidized wood, which have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of oxygenated functional
groups, which can absorb ammonia or
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have mychar, the human solid
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all pyrolyzed at 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was oxidized after pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I have this carboxylic point at
about 1,700 wave number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the oxidized wood,
it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of there in wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very absent in mychar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have these sort of oxygenated,
it doesn't have these kind of functional
[SPEAKER_00]: groups in the same proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a phenolic peak here for OH and CO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I can see it with wood,
but I really don't see it in mychar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have this amine peak,
because I have so much organic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, looking at the spectra,
I'm like, I don't really know if this
[SPEAKER_00]: material is going to really sorb ammonia
or ammonium through these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I say, OK, let's put that on
hold for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just do an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take a bunch of urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take some biochar from
synergy, and we're going to mix it all
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at how much
nitrogen we can actually sorb onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took some fresh urine from synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acidified it to a pH of 6 to try to get
all the nitrogen as ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some fresh urine that was already
at a pH of 9 through the ureaase
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to control deionized water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just added the biochar made from synergy
at 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the ratio I added it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I determined the nitrogen loading by
combustion on a CN analyzer at ICRAF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what did I see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that the acidified urine was the
only treatment that actually gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit increase in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a 1.1% increase in total nitrogen,
assuming it's mineral, after this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that I was probably
retaining ammonium, because most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen was speciated as ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually is greater than what
would have normally been predicted by
[SPEAKER_00]: cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be some other mechanisms at
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to move on to what I
thought might be more promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was trying to precipitate a
nitrogen salt onto the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, basically using the biochar to
nucleate these salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a system where I had these
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made these suspensions with this
concentrated nitrogen solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a synthetic urine solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I added a bunch of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I injected carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole bunch of different
configurations of this experiment to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if anything would precipitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I ended up doing is I raised the
pH of this very concentrated ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride with sodium hydroxide so high,
and did this injection with carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: that I actually got sodium bicarbonate
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very strange, but that was not what
I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I eventually settled on that I
really needed to start moving towards
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the gas phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably should have done this with
ammonia, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept ammonia in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that water, especially
since the solution was at a pH of 9.25,
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, similar to water, can form
hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is probably interfering in all of
these potential interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I probably need to move towards
working in the gas phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used three different types of
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used wood, unoxidized wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is oxidized wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used the human waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all pyrolyzed at 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my final configuration was I immersed
the char into this concentrated nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I filtered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I flushed carbon dioxide gas over
the surface of the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I was hoping to do was to
sequentially sorb ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the amine functional groups
that I thought I might be incorporating,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorb carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe I could sorb ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to do this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I got, so I was trying to
eventually basically get the precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: of ammonium bicarbonate through the
sorption of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I saw was that on the y-axis of
this graph, I have the percent increase of
[SPEAKER_00]: total nitrogen from the exposure to the
urine solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I have these categorical
variables of carbon dioxide exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide gas and nitrogen gas,
which is just the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have these three different materials
I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human solid waste char, the oxidized
wood, and the unoxidized wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that there was no significant
difference in the amount of nitrogen that
[SPEAKER_00]: was loaded onto the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was measured by combustion at CNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can sort of like, you're like,
oh, that's kind of a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of moving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that if I need to
reconfigure this, and I think I might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to actually see what I'm trying to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it stands, I was definitely able to
increase the nitrogen concentration and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the just exposure to nitrogen to
this concentrated solution for a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to increase the total nitrogen
which I'm assuming is mineral from that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution by between 2.6% and 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence of a slight increase with carbon
dioxide, obviously, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there could be interference with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that we just need a
different experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to just show one last
thing, was I then took these chars back
[SPEAKER_00]: and went to CCMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the FTIR spectra of these
three different chars that I've already
shown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue line are the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the spectra that you already
saw, just the chars without exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line are the chars that were
immersed in the solution and then exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to carbon dioxide through this flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green line are sort of like the
control chars that were immersed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and then exposed just to inert
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I saw was that in all of the
chars, I was able to increase the
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to distinguish that there
were two new peaks that formed at the 1400
[SPEAKER_00]: area and at the 3000 area here,
this area here, in all of the materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of more prominent in the oxidized
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this 1400 peak corresponds to ionic
ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either this is sort of crystalline on
the surface or electrostatically absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people would know better,
like Anita and Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a novice, but I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these two peaks are, so what I
learned is that these two peaks together
[SPEAKER_00]: can be indicative, these two fangs of an
amine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did correlate this one website,
this other website, that at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have the incorporation of amine
functional groups, sort of through what I
[SPEAKER_00]: had shown you about that Bronsted
interaction, this ammonia adsorbent to
[SPEAKER_00]: these functional groups, through this
nucleophilic addition and forming these
[SPEAKER_00]: amine groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that here I might be seeing
ammonia sorbing, ammonium, and here I
[SPEAKER_00]: might be seeing ammonia sorb, because
remember, the pH was right at the pKa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had both species in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's very interesting,
because I think with my carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, I need more of these functional
groups to get this to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so that is my FTR data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in conclusion, I just want to say
that, oh, I just want to say that despite
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer proportion of carboxyl and phenolic,
oh, another thing I noticed, I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to say this, was that there's a phenolic
peak in the wood that here, at about
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,200, that disappears after exposure to
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really see it in the human
waste, because I didn't really have that
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so despite fewer proportion of
carboxyl and phenolic groups, human cell
[SPEAKER_00]: waste sorbed about 3%, mineral nitrogen
2.6, more than the CEC predicts,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly, I don't know, if it's through
physisorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this precipitation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just looking at these mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, and so in conclusion,
I just want to say that the pyrolyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: waste doesn't seem chemically poised to
retain ammonia or ammonium based on
[SPEAKER_00]: acid-base interactions, unless by metals,
because initially, the FTIR spectra showed
[SPEAKER_00]: a low proportion of oxygenated functional
groups in CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we are retaining both ammonia and
ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So urine absorption showed retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first experiment of ammonia,
the FTIR poured to the incorporation of
[SPEAKER_00]: amine groups, probably through ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And precipitation was not observed
visually, might not be possible with water
[SPEAKER_00]: in a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, we achieved end loading by
2.5% points, giving us our total
[SPEAKER_00]: extractable NPK of 2.5, 0.8, and 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad for an organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it's worth iteration, because
remember kibera and the maize trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to thank, so I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to thank my advisors,
Johannes and Harold, Rebecca Nelson,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I put Beth Medvecki.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with her in the Eiger,
and she's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people at Sanergy and the Climate
Foundation, Fausto and Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, people in Johannes
Lehmann's lab, especially Akio and Kelly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dory and Rachel, who helped me through
so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone else has been so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alyssa Kirsch, with whom I did a lot of
these other experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others, Murray McBride.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I TA'd for him, I would always be
like, what about the nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Janice, Shai, Rio, over at Frank
DiSalvo's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, for helping me analyze the,
for helping me interpret the spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan, Kathy Howe, all these people,
people at University of Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CNAL, because they let me run their
machines and mess everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hugh, he did an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to, and also the funding
from the Eiger, poverty reduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really can't speak from empirical
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tested this, although we did
test PAHs and Dioxins, and they were not
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of xenobiotics, I'm just
assuming that if you go up to 500 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming 300 to 500 degrees,
you'll probably have the transformation of
[SPEAKER_00]: xenobiotics, probably aromatic rings
fusing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with urine, it's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a concern, because you can
pasteurize urine very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get rid of the pathogenic
organisms at about 70 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that urine has xenobiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, the process that I'm
interested in, now looking at urine,
[SPEAKER_00]: is trying to absorb nitrogen from the gas
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just avoid the whole issue of
xenobiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this paper that I'm writing on the
value, I want to subtract from the value
[SPEAKER_00]: the contribution from sodium, because
yeah, it's a deterrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is from the charred waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also sodium in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why I think that there are
some issues with, definitely, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: with sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at trying to concentrate
urine using porous membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get membranes that can allow,
because sodium is a little bit larger than
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's been in the forefront of
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to prevent sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if you don't have heavy
metals, that can ruin everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious with the initial part
of the producer-based or consumer-based
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you looked at transportation costs at
all, would that be an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I need to, yeah, honestly,
I'm still figuring out to what extent I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to, like, how far the cycle should
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's, yeah,
very important, transportation costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't incorporated that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to keep it really simple,
but I do think that it's difficult to make
[SPEAKER_00]: an argument if you're not even considering
how to get the material to the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to really consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
