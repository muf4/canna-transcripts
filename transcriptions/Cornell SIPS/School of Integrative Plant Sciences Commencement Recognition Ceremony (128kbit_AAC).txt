[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, and welcome to commencement
Sunday at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to have everyone
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told to keep my remarks rather
brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an action-packed hour for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, thank you very much for getting up
before 8 AM and arriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying something new at commencement
this year, which I'll explain in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, I promise just a couple
remarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first day when both our
undergraduates and graduate students
[SPEAKER_01]: arrived, I tell everyone that there is
nothing that the faculty and staff at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell want more than for all of you to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a culmination of that
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for succeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, parents and friends,
for helping your student to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to the faculty for all the
work you've put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get to where we are with these folks
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of getting to know
many of you, and it's remarkable to me how
[SPEAKER_01]: much each of you has taken control of
either your schoolwork or your research
[SPEAKER_01]: project and really found your own voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's so important as
students as you move forward to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: that voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to continue to use that voice and one
of the things that many of you know I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: very passionate about is using your voice
to connect to the public and the
[SPEAKER_01]: communities that you move to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sincerely hope that each of you will
use your voice to speak to those with whom
[SPEAKER_01]: you agree and to speak with those with
whom you might not agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to use your voice to bring people
together and to bridge the gap that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes exists between the public and
our academic institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we're going to start our
festivities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are today honoring undergraduate majors
in the plant sciences and agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: sciences along with our graduate students
in the fields of horticulture,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant biology, plant breeding,
plant pathology and plant microbiology,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to do today for the
first time, so be a bit patient with us if
[SPEAKER_01]: you would, is we are actually going to
have the director of undergraduate
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, the section chair for each of our
graduate fields along with the major
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor for each student.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major advisor will in fact put the
hood onto each candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some research into the history of
the hooding ceremony and it actually comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from ancient, well, older times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe and specifically in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a sign of the difference that
there was between those who were in
[SPEAKER_01]: academia and those who were not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the term, it's not that the term town
and gown actually originated during those
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that these days we hope to
bring town and gown together and through
[SPEAKER_01]: the ceremony while we are being hooded,
we'll also remember that we are part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, we are going to
start with the field of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our certificate will be presented to each
graduate by Dr. Steve Reiners,
[SPEAKER_01]: chair of the horticulture section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each graduate will be announced by Dr.
William Miller who is our director of
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Chris and good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four candidates who have earned
advanced degrees in this academic year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would like to start with,
in fact my student, Isabel Brastrom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Isabel, I believe the idea is that
you, yeah, come up to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Isabel worked with me on a master's
degree and she worked on post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology of tulips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Yoshi Harada here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We think Yoshi has not been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoshi has earned his PhD in horticulture
with Professor Nina Bassack and Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitlow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he worked on biogeochemistry of the
Brooklyn Grange and urban rooftop farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't have Yoshi, let's give
Yoshi a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next candidate is Al Pacheco
Kovaleski, PhD in horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with Bruce Reich and Jason Lando,
based in the Geneva Experiment Station,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about an hour north of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Al worked on aspects of cold hardiness
and dormancy in grape vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now I see why we have him here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our final candidate in horticulture is
Grant Thompson.
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD, and Grant earned his PhD with Jenny
Calniffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the topic of his dissertation was
implications of land use legacy on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes of urban grasslands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, moving on to the graduate field of
plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mike Scanlon will be announcing our
graduates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Klaus Van Wick, section chair,
will be handing out the certificates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud to announce our three PhDs today
in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is Daniela Alevato.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got a PhD for her work on evolution of
phytochemical diversity in pilocarpus.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are combined phylogenetic and
environmental analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she'll be hooded by her advisor,
Dr. Kevin Nixon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next recipient is Camilla Martinez.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she did her work on two cenozoic flora
from South America, paleo-climatic and
[SPEAKER_03]: paleo-altimetry inferences.

[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's my great pleasure to
introduce Don Wayans, professor in plant
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and genetics, also associate dean
and director of academic programs,
[SPEAKER_02]: who will announce the Raine Memorial Award
winners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Olena.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the privilege of presenting the
Charles A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ring Memorial Award to two of our
graduating seniors in the plant sciences
[SPEAKER_04]: major, and this award is given on the
basis of their scholastic achievement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna announce their names right
now so you can make your way up while I
[SPEAKER_04]: say a few things about the award itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the two students are Ziren Lin and
Matthew Seaman, so if you could please
[SPEAKER_04]: come up to the podium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So each of these two students will receive
two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is a certificate that's signed by the
plant sciences major, his curriculum
[SPEAKER_04]: committee, and also the dean of the
college, and they will also receive a $375
[SPEAKER_04]: check for each one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the money for the check actually came
from the payout of an endowment that was
[SPEAKER_04]: left by Charles A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ring really over 100 years ago,
it was 1913 when this endowment was given
[SPEAKER_04]: to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was given for the advancement of
the plant sciences, but it was also given
[SPEAKER_04]: because, and I'm reading a quote here that
comes out of the archives, it says,
[SPEAKER_04]: because my father, Dr. William Ring,
was a personal friend of the founder of
[SPEAKER_04]: this university, also an acknowledgement
of the great assistance the university has
[SPEAKER_04]: been to me on my farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to congratulate both of these
students on behalf of the faculty and
[SPEAKER_04]: staff in the plant sciences major,
and again on behalf of the college dean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ziren, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations to both of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to invite Tony DiTomasso to come
to the podium for the next part of our
[SPEAKER_04]: program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony is a professor in the section of soil
and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also the director of undergraduate
studies in the agricultural sciences
[SPEAKER_04]: major.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're now getting to the really
exciting part, which is honoring our
[SPEAKER_05]: undergraduates in the agricultural science
and plant sciences majors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to pass on a regret from
Professor Marvin Pritz, who's the director
[SPEAKER_05]: of undergraduate studies for the plant
science major, and his son, Kevin,
[SPEAKER_05]: is graduating this morning in the
department of entomology, so he couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hence why I'll be covering the dual
purposes of announcing our undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_05]: For you parents, friends, just want to
tell you, this is an amazing group of
[SPEAKER_05]: students.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you look at what they've achieved
in the four years they've been at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_05]: or in some cases, even less than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's truly amazing, and I'm expecting some
great things from all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, just to let you know how
this is going to work, I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: announcing the names of the students in
both majors in alphabetical order.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will be a mix of ag science and
plant science.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will mention also what degree they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: In many cases, we've got double majors
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: IED students are definitely high
achievers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also letting you know if they have any
Latin honors and distinction in research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I will begin with Cairo
Archer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad I don't have to hood 35
students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday, someday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next student is Dennis Attia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Dennis,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll just mention as Dennis walks up
here that for Cairo Archer, because I was
[SPEAKER_05]: handing out the diploma, sorry,
I didn't mention that she's a double major
[SPEAKER_05]: in nutritional science and plant sciences
and also has graduated with distinction in
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Cairo, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis is also a double major in
agricultural science and animal science

[SPEAKER_05]: I will now say some words of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a couple of things for our PhD
masters, graduate students, and our
[SPEAKER_05]: undergraduates, and family, and all of
your friends and parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a faculty member, I can say and speak
for our other faculty members here and
[SPEAKER_05]: those that are not here that it's been a
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had the highs and lows, but it's
been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a pleasure to have been a part
of your, hopefully in some cases,
[SPEAKER_05]: your kids and sons and daughters,
their kind of progression through Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've learned a lot, but we've
learned a lot as faculty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably one of the things that I
personally, but I know a lot of my fellow
[SPEAKER_05]: faculty members enjoy, is to be part of
something that's greater than us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always tell these students,
if I can get to Cornell and I can be a
[SPEAKER_05]: faculty member here, you guys can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just want to really thank all of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly thank the graduates,
but thank the parents, family,
[SPEAKER_05]: friends for supporting our students in the
plant sciences and in the agricultural
[SPEAKER_05]: sciences, and certainly our graduate
programs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I speak for all of us to thank
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really wish the best for these
young folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're going to do some great
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to hear from all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to hear from you as to where kind
of the next career path is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the most important part, this is an
act school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right after the graduation ceremony at
Shokoff, we will be meeting in Trillium,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is near Kennedy Hall.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be at what, 12-15 or so?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right after the ceremony, and the lunch
will be served.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a great chance for all of us,
faculty and others, to interact with your
[SPEAKER_05]: family members.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our graduates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please don't forget that right after
the ceremony is done over at Trillium.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not sure where that is,
just ask anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I cannot forget to thank the two folks
that have organized this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see I really prepped for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leah Cook and Kerry Richards.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really have to thank them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they say there's always
somebody behind me, somebody else's
[SPEAKER_05]: facade.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the folks that have really been
in the trenches for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the students know them, all of our
graduates and undergraduates and faculty.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate all of their help.
[SPEAKER_05]: The little details that most of us faculty
don't kind of think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you guys again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see you hopefully at Trillium
after the ceremony over at Shokoff Field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering, Kerry or Leah,
was there supposed to be a group picture
[SPEAKER_05]: of the graduates?
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant science, yes, on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: On stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plant science majors on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see if the ex-science students
do have to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
