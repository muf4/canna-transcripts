[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really delighted today to introduce three
of our really excellent scholars here at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell that will be talking on the topic
of COVID-19 and the resilience of global
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all know that lots of things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of things have been jeopardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things have held up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've learned a lot of lessons since
March about the resilience of our ag
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and how COVID-19 has played out in
different parts of the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the panel will do today is step
through three geographic case studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia, Africa, and upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to pivot into some
pre-planned questions and then have some
[SPEAKER_01]: time at the end for open Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have questions, please,
if you think you're going to forget them,
[SPEAKER_01]: pop them into the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll make sure that we return to them
at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm delighted to have the three
excellent scholars on the panel today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rachel Besner Kerr is a professor in the
Department of Global Development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Mubaya is a senior research associate,
also in the Department of Global
[SPEAKER_01]: Development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Prabhu Pingali is a professor in the
Dyson School, but also with a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: appointment in global development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rachel will be speaking about upstate
New York, Ed focusing on Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Prabhu on India, the Asian context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will be fielding questions
from more of a global perspective after
[SPEAKER_01]: they do some case study review for those
geographies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without any further ado, thank you very
much for attending today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to work from east to west.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with Prabhu, and then Ed,
and then Rachel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Prabhu, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited to talk to the Soil and Crop
Science Seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Andrew said, I'd like to talk about
Asia and specifically about what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happened with the COVID crisis and how
it's affected food systems in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you a bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bottom line is I have been enormously
surprised by how resilient the food
[SPEAKER_03]: systems in India have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: to the crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll show you some data on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been extremely concerned about
the humanitarian impact of the crisis,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has been primarily the result of a
massive reverse migration of millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: poor people from urban areas back to their
rural households in a totally unplanned
[SPEAKER_03]: manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the government did not program this
and did not really think through the
[SPEAKER_03]: implications of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the long-term impact of this reverse
migration is something that we'll have to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep watching and seeing what happens over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third impact I see is long-term
chronic impacts on nutrition, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: child nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming about because of
disruptions in some of the safety net
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, especially focused on children
in India today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be coming to all of those issues
as we go through this talk, which I hope
[SPEAKER_03]: to do very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to give you a timeline here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the crisis started in
December in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: India got its first case by the end of
January.
[SPEAKER_03]: By mid-March, there were about 50 cases in
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then India went into an absolute total
lockdown with less than 24 hours notice by
[SPEAKER_03]: March 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it went through those lockdowns,
tried to come out, went back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the way up till mid-August,
they were in a lockdown mode and finally
[SPEAKER_03]: just came out because there was no way you
can keep a billion people locked down
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during that period of lockdown,
the Indian COVID numbers were actually not
[SPEAKER_03]: too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once the lockdown stopped,
those numbers have skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today India is, I think, number three
or number two, depending on who's counting
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of total numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of cases around the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a massive problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ongoing problem that we're
observing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my group, the Tata Connell Institute,
is keeping a track of this as we go along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to start with an advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put out a fairly detailed report on
pandemic prices and their implications for
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition security in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: A fairly data-intensive document that's
available on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: That document went up till end of May.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't updated it, but we've been
keeping track of the data since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hope we'll be able to do an updated
version of this document, which basically
[SPEAKER_03]: looks at what's happened to food supply,
food prices, the urban food supply chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then looked at the safety net programs
in India, the subsidized food grain
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution system, the public
distribution system, the PDS, and also the
[SPEAKER_03]: child development program in India,
which is a very large integrated child
[SPEAKER_03]: development program that runs across rural
areas in India, and how that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: faring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mid-day meal scheme in schools in
India, which is a really important part of
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition and how they've been faring.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the big story, of course, is the
reverse migration and the loss of income
[SPEAKER_03]: and remittances, which we talked through
also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those of you who are interested,
it's available on the Tata Connell
[SPEAKER_03]: Institute website, and you can download it
for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the issues that we'd like to
look at in great detail is what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening to urban food prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tracked major urban food markets
across the country, and we've tracked them
[SPEAKER_03]: on a weekly basis from March all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still doing the tracking now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've tracked them for all the major
commodities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just giving you some examples
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tracked them for staple grains,
for pulses, which was a really important
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the protein diet in India,
vegetables, meat, milk, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we've done is we've compared the
weekly data against the same week last
[SPEAKER_03]: year to see what the differences have
been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly enough, if you look at
staples, there's been very much marginal
[SPEAKER_03]: change that took place in staple grains
and also fairly small change in pulses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger change has been in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegetables saw a fairly dramatic shift
upwards in prices during the early part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the lockdown period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then after that, by mid-May,
prices started to come down quite
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, vegetable prices are fairly
close to what they were at the same time
[SPEAKER_03]: last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because the government very
quickly made a decision that if we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep urban populations food secure and
happy, we better open up the food markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they made food traders essential
service providers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the supply chains that were broken
in the early part of the lockdown opened
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you began to see supplies coming in
and markets functioning fairly regularly
[SPEAKER_03]: with or without masks for people who are
going to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so prices came down quite
significantly after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the real challenge has been with
employment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see here, oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that there was a sharp rise in
unemployment rates that took place just as
[SPEAKER_03]: the lockdown happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the primary reason for that is a large
part of the labor force is this casual
[SPEAKER_03]: labor, daily labor, semi-skilled labor
that's migrated from rural areas into
[SPEAKER_03]: urban areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in rural areas in the smaller
towns, et cetera, much of the labor that's
[SPEAKER_03]: employed is in this non-contractual or
semi-contractual arrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the lockdown happened,
all of those jobs disappeared overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that started this massive
movement of populations back into rural
[SPEAKER_03]: areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no transport systems,
no railways, no buses, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people actually walked several
days to get back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fairly sad and major humanitarian
disaster when you think about it and think
[SPEAKER_03]: about how that had happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the longer-term implications of that
was it had a significant effect on the
[SPEAKER_03]: income that goes to rural households.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with the loss in employment,
much of the remittance income that rural
[SPEAKER_03]: households depend on for their food
consumption and other consumption dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you saw a big drop in overall
consumption that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been using monthly data that comes
out of the survey that cuts across the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a consumer monitoring survey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're waiting, the last round that we
have access to is from June.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're looking for, we'll be waiting
for the next round to come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we saw initially was this
dramatic drop in overall food expenditures
[SPEAKER_03]: for all the different food groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's interesting is that the drop
for staples was much smaller than the drop
[SPEAKER_03]: for some of the other major food groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also interesting is the drop in food
consumption was much higher in urban areas
[SPEAKER_03]: than in rural areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I suspect we're going to see a change
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we see the next round coming in,
I think the bigger change we'll see is in
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the more nutritious food groups
such as vegetables, pulses, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: in rural areas, relative to urban areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's primarily because of this
income change that's happened,
[SPEAKER_03]: this remittance income.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get the next round of data,
we'll be able to separate out the effect
[SPEAKER_03]: of the supply chain disruption and the
price rise relative to the income drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my hypothesis is that that income drop
is going to be a much bigger driver of the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption change that we're going to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the safety net programs?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned earlier, the public
distribution system of subsidized food
[SPEAKER_03]: grains is one of the largest safety net
programs in the world that India provides
[SPEAKER_03]: around 15 kg of free or almost free rice
or wheat to every household in rural areas
[SPEAKER_03]: in India per month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when the crisis happened,
because of this movement of populations
[SPEAKER_03]: back into rural areas, they actually added
another 15 kg additional amounts to this
[SPEAKER_03]: subsidized grain that was provided.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a telephone survey across a
sample of households that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: working with in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were asked specifically about their
access to the subsidized grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them, I mean, generally,
the majority reported that they had no
[SPEAKER_03]: problem in getting access to this grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from a purely hunger point of view,
calorie hunger point of view, we've not
[SPEAKER_03]: seen a dramatic increase in hunger in
India despite the crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's actually good news.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the bad news side, the drop in the
ICDS program, which runs the child welfare
[SPEAKER_03]: schemes and child nutrition schemes,
those programs were closed down and the
[SPEAKER_03]: midday meal program in schools was closed
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so access to food and nutrition for
children became a major issue and
[SPEAKER_03]: continues to be a major issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my concern is not so much about hunger.
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern is long term nutritional
implications for children, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: children under five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the effects on stunting,
et cetera, that can come in from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the migration issue
continues to be a major concern as we look
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of these people are still in rural
areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't gone back into the cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cities haven't generated that
employment opportunities as they used to
[SPEAKER_03]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you still have a whole set of
family members who are stuck at home and
[SPEAKER_03]: they need to be fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're also going to start competing
in the rural labor market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can have a fairly depressing
effect on wages in rural areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can also affect marginal working
population, especially rural women who
[SPEAKER_03]: depend on employment for weeding and
harvesting and transplanting, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: for their incomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that there's additional family
labor available at home, much of that
[SPEAKER_03]: employment for these rural women may be
affected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really concerned about what are
some of the longer term implications of
[SPEAKER_03]: this reverse migration that's happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether we can create new and better
employment opportunities for these
[SPEAKER_03]: populations in the villages or in the
neighborhood towns, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than having them go all the way
back into Mumbai and Delhi, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a challenge I think the government
needs to be thinking through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, to conclude on the
implications for food security,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the staple grain prices have
remained fairly stable and the vegetables
[SPEAKER_03]: and other nutritional crops are coming
back towards normal trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it speaks to fairly significant
resilience of the food system itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether the supply disruption will
continue into the future in urban areas if
[SPEAKER_03]: this crisis continues is a question mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my view, I think we're not going to
see that disruptions in food supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're going to see is implications
for unemployment continuing to be high,
[SPEAKER_03]: the loss of remittance income continuing
to be high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that affects food access and diets and
diet diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the impact of the shock on diet
quality is something that we should be
[SPEAKER_03]: worried about, especially when you think
about children and child nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you who are interested in a
deeper dive into the India situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of material on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a whole dedicated section on
COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd invite you to check us out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Prabhu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be returning to questions for
Prabhu's presentation at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll invite Ed Mubaya to upload his
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while that is being done, I just wanted
to start with a qualify and say that a
[SPEAKER_00]: large part of what Prabhu presented for
India bears some similarity with what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in Africa as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be some a little bit of an
overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second qualify being that Africa is a
large continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm painting with very broad brush what
is 54 countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll speak much more to sub-Saharan
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there won't be as many numbers because
this is very generalized, sterilized
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of new evidence that we're getting
from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make five key points in this
opening segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first point I want to make is we have
kind of the Africa situation in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pandemic itself is still very much a
mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least to me, I've not had any really
convincing one narrative on why Africa has
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat been spared to date in terms of
the epidemiology itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many theories out there,
but what I'm showing you right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulative cases from Johns Hopkins
Coronavirus Resource Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see from this map, the map of
Africa is very much lower numbers in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of cumulative cases compared to look at
the US, for example, and Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually on most maps, Africa is the red
one and the rest of the world is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: the green side.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the incidence rate,
so this is divided by population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that it's even less the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have this big anomaly that
many theories have been proposed on why
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa has not been affected as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention a few of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was the BCG vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is the warm climate in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is a relatively youthful
population with Africa having more than
[SPEAKER_00]: three quarters of the continent under the
age of 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say collectively, they might start
to explain something, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they are anywhere close to explaining the
anomalies even within Africa itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you have pockets in South
Africa and in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have said just it's lack
of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little testing in some of
this, but you would also think that
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals would be starting to fill up by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group that I've had starting to
get to gain momentum now is maybe people
[SPEAKER_00]: have not given enough credit to key
decisions that were made by African
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Africa closed down borders in March
of this year and there already was very
[SPEAKER_00]: little movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the disease load there was low from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's a lesson that we need to
be sharing with the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not try to speculate onto which of
those is correct, but it suffice it to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that in terms of disease load itself,
Africa right now is a very, very low
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it continues this way,
but this is what we know as of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that said, the impact of the pandemic
itself has been much more indirect through
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show two more slides and I'll
speak more freely on some of my certain
[SPEAKER_00]: points that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: One key, a lot of evidence is coming in
now from different sources, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just very recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out last month in Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about, with this last point
that I made, the closure of national
[SPEAKER_00]: boundaries in Africa came with a lot of
disruption in movement of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like this is having a lot of
effects on the planting season for most
[SPEAKER_00]: crops now in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by every estimate, the disruption in
staple food supply, especially for maize
[SPEAKER_00]: and rice, inputs usually come from urban
areas go to rural areas and products move
[SPEAKER_00]: from rural areas go to urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that has been disrupted at local
level, domestic level, and the regional
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is likely to have significant
effects, if not now in the next season,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the amount of food that is available
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This report goes on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this just shows you the two main
staple crops of rice and maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there the impact on the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: When COVID hit in early March and April,
it was really at the key part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting season and that was disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're likely to see this effect in a
few months from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that disrupted the
production system for most of the staple
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to be at the African
Development Bank when COVID-19 was
[SPEAKER_00]: declared a global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my last tasks at the African
Development Bank, I actually delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: this to the board in June, was to develop
a strategy for the feed Africa response to
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 that was going to be implemented
across the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key measurements that we came up with
to minimize disruption of food flow in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa were eight key areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go through them here because
they kind of capture the thinking around
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, some of which has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided we were going to invest in
about eight key priorities in the African
[SPEAKER_00]: development area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bank was putting up about $10
billion to help African countries cope
[SPEAKER_00]: with this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did supporting for food delivery,
especially targeting the poor and
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also supported governments in creating
stabilization of food prices either by
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing food from strategic grain
reserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We supported efforts to increase localized
food production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that, and I'll get into this in a
little bit, that localized food production
[SPEAKER_00]: was more likely to be stable and resilient
compared to food that was coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encouraged governments to invest a lot
in extension and advisory services so that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was minimal disruption in
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried as much as we could, there was still
some significant disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-harvest and agro-processing of highly
nutritious foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about fruits and
vegetables and meat, highly perishable
[SPEAKER_00]: goods, we realized we needed to invest a
lot of resources into preserving the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also policy support for free flow of food
and other inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to declare for most countries that
food was essential service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created a green channel through
which food could flow from country to
[SPEAKER_00]: country and within countries and spread
from the main of the quarantine measures
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We established some food security task
forces that were regional level and also
[SPEAKER_00]: supported several other regional
initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will stop sharing my screen now so I can
actually see and talk to the people and I
[SPEAKER_00]: will make three more points about what
this pandemic did for food security in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to note that the pandemic
came on top of already existing food
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurity on the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa was already battling with upwards
of 74 million people were food insecure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was already a climate shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with the locust invasion
that had taken on all the whole of Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were dealing full of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this shock came, it came on
pre-existing conditions that just made
[SPEAKER_00]: things worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be hard to actually disentangle
these different effects from COVID-19
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what was already existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something important to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another point is that these actually turns
out to be a zero sum game when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: public resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that hit us very,
very quickly that, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about governments, even
development community, they have a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you take from what you put money
into health, into education, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that money from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments were faced with this critical
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love agriculture, but this is a health
crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ministers of health had the biggest
voice in most of the resources went to
[SPEAKER_00]: health first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really had to campaign hard to say
that, look, this is more of a food crisis
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic for Africa than it is a health
crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really had to fight for those
resources across the different other
[SPEAKER_00]: sectors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of this back and forth
depend on where governments were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allocate their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I want to speak more to which
groups have been most affected by this in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence is still coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to underscore this point that
we're just at the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any conclusions that we make now are
likely to be premature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the evidence that we're seeing so far
is that low income households have been
[SPEAKER_00]: affected the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost by definition, low income
households have been the most vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the pandemic,
there was a rush to buy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most households to stock up and hold
up, you know, much like what you did to
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was happening in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelves were getting cleared up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But poor people who live from hand to
mouth do not have that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the shelves were initially
emptied, prices went up and poor people
[SPEAKER_00]: did not have money to buy and stock up in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have free refrigerators to
keep their food in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing a large part of the
affected population being the most poor
[SPEAKER_00]: and vulnerable populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that subgroup, you also have women
and children.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all the evidence that we're
seeing here is being the most affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say when you compare rural to
urban households, rural households at
[SPEAKER_00]: least had the advantage that they had
localized food production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were a little bit more resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a large part of Africa's urban
population was employed in the informal
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they lost their flow of income,
they did not have any recourse to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, income that they could use to
purchase food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not have the capabilities to
grow their own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them either, if they still had
connections to rural areas, they migrated
[SPEAKER_00]: back to their parents' home in the rural
areas, increasing the pressure there,
[SPEAKER_00]: much like Prabhu mentioned for India as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing a large part of this
human movement from rural to urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing the most vulnerable
groups bearing the brunt of this pandemic
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it there for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get back to other points related
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over to you, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an honor to be presenting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today I'm presenting on something
that's quite different from my usual
[SPEAKER_06]: focus, because most of my work is in
Malawi in Southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have had the privilege of working in
New York as a volunteer around COVID-19
[SPEAKER_06]: and the food system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I was asked to present on
New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we go from a continent to a country
and now to a region of a state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one that you all have, or many of you,
I don't want to make assumptions about
[SPEAKER_06]: where you are now, but many of you have
experienced directly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a real sweep today.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to move from food producer
over to consumer and looking at the food
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to say that my role in looking at
New York has been on the Tompkins County
[SPEAKER_06]: COVID-19 Food Task Force, which I
co-organized with Rafael Ponte and the
[SPEAKER_06]: late Kirby Edmonds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And CCE and others at the start of the
pandemic as a response to trying to deal
[SPEAKER_06]: with the impacts on the food system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of food producers,
we know early on there was really
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges in New York around changes in
markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you had schools closing, as restaurants
shut down in the lockdown, that meant a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of markets that were normally
available for producers were gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw this particularly with the
dairy industry with losing their market in
[SPEAKER_06]: schools and restaurants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually had to dump a significant
amount of their milk at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_06]: the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that got a lot of attention nationally
and even internationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were other significant impacts
on producers and it really varied by
[SPEAKER_06]: sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a recent survey that the New York
state government did found 65 percent of
[SPEAKER_06]: New York farms were affected negatively by
the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything from labor shortages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was particularly an issue for the
fruit and vegetable industry when you had
[SPEAKER_06]: restrictions on migration and movement
into the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And within states, it led to both
shortages and uncertainty about labor
[SPEAKER_06]: supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this real shift in demand and
market opportunities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So both soaring demand in some areas,
for example, in local meat, there was a
[SPEAKER_06]: really steep increase in in local demand
for demand for local meat and reduced
[SPEAKER_06]: demand, for example, restaurants and other
other institutions that used to be
[SPEAKER_06]: available.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some local fruit and vegetable
producers who had a range of options who
[SPEAKER_06]: had a range of markets normally they were
able to adjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: But others who depended on some of these
institutional sources really struggled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there was a lot of variation in the
impact and how it was felt.
[SPEAKER_06]: But often a need to pivot in the way that
their product was sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes that meant learning new
skills, learning how to market things
[SPEAKER_06]: online, learning how to work through new
distributors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a real steep learning curve.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those who were planting crop based
producers, often at a time when they were
[SPEAKER_06]: having to plan at the beginning of the
season what to plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, really high stress circumstance
for farmers, for producers across the
[SPEAKER_06]: state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this wasn't only felt for producers,
it was really felt for farm workers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And farm workers were particularly
vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 in
[SPEAKER_06]: part because of their own often precarious
employment conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They initially lacked information about
PPE and COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Cornell farm worker program,
which is here at Cornell has been really
[SPEAKER_06]: essential in providing some critical
information to farm workers and really
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to connect with them as there was a
lot of confusion and uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also their own living conditions made
it difficult if there was a case,
[SPEAKER_06]: it often spread quickly and there was some
high profile cases at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_06]: pandemic that drew attention to this
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hard to isolate and hard to prevent
spread.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then because of their own employment
conditions sometimes a lack of access to
[SPEAKER_06]: healthcare and testing, which the number
of organizations working with farm workers
[SPEAKER_06]: like the farm worker program here in
Ithaca really tried to, and in the
[SPEAKER_06]: surrounding region really tried to
alleviate an ongoing challenge for that
[SPEAKER_06]: particular sector within our community
that is not always visible to us even
[SPEAKER_06]: though they're a crucial part of the food
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thinking about food retail, there was a
real shift and we all felt it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed talked about the rush on food.
[SPEAKER_06]: And different supplies and we certainly
saw that in our own grocery stores here in
[SPEAKER_06]: New York state.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, we saw a real loss of
jobs for many people working in the food
[SPEAKER_06]: service industry and a shift towards
online delivery and online orders.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of small food retail businesses,
restaurants and food businesses closing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this all made for impacts on the
consumer end, but inconsistent supplies in
[SPEAKER_06]: grocery retailers and supply chain
disruptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was on the retail side,
but then on the consumption side,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have sort of contrasting stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the one hand, there was this surge in
interest in joining communities and
[SPEAKER_06]: community supported agriculture in buying
local, buying from local farmers markets,
[SPEAKER_06]: buying from local farms, interest in home
gardening and canning.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been shortages of canning supplies
in the grocery stores because of this
[SPEAKER_06]: interest and a lot of kind of relearning
home food preparation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a happy story for some,
but in contrast, you have rising
[SPEAKER_06]: disparities in access to healthy food and
a recent paper out of the University of
[SPEAKER_06]: Buffalo really highlighted this disparity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ordering food online is often more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're sick at home and you need to
have food delivered to your home,
[SPEAKER_06]: that could mean you can't access it
easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snap, the supplemental nutrition program
here in the United States isn't always
[SPEAKER_06]: available for online retail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people had, there was a rise in
unemployment so people had less money
[SPEAKER_06]: available for purchasing food.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was shorter shopping hours that may
not be accessible for people who are
[SPEAKER_06]: working several part-time jobs and less
food available when you get to the grocery
[SPEAKER_06]: store at times because of this supply
chain disruption.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was particularly in the early
period of the pandemic, as well as school
[SPEAKER_06]: food disruptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some school programs were able to do
home delivery and in Tompkins County,
[SPEAKER_06]: we were lucky that the school system
really shifted and delivered food to kids
[SPEAKER_06]: at home throughout the early lockdown
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: But all of this put together led to
dramatic surge in food insecurity in the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States and in New York in
particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from Feeding America,
but there's a real recent report put
[SPEAKER_06]: together by Cornell CCE and which also
documents this rise in food insecurity
[SPEAKER_06]: nationally from 11% to 23% and an
estimated in Tompkins County, an increase
[SPEAKER_06]: from 10.3% to 13%, 13.6%.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are preliminary numbers and I know
there's a lot of effort to try to document
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: At a national scale, but nonetheless,
it's been well documented.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a dramatic surge in food
insecurity and it's being felt more
[SPEAKER_06]: acutely by particular groups of
households.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 38% of black households in the United
States are estimated to be food insecure,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: And alongside this is real challenges with
emergency food provision in New York and
[SPEAKER_06]: at a national scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we saw for the first few months of the
pandemic, this dramatic increase in the
[SPEAKER_06]: number of people looking for free food
because they had lost their job and they
[SPEAKER_06]: were facing serious shortages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many had never had to access emergency
food prior to this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a dramatic increase in the
amount of food distributed through food
[SPEAKER_06]: banks, and we saw this in some of the
early headlines in the spring and the
[SPEAKER_06]: summer with long lineups and waiting for
food distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: And combined with the impacts in the
retail food industry, there was a 70%
[SPEAKER_06]: decline in retail food donations,
an estimated 70% decline.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are one of the major two food
banks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And retail food groceries are some of the
major suppliers of food to food banks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this meant that some food banks had
to reduce the amount provided to
[SPEAKER_06]: households.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have increase in demand and a
decrease in supply at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you also saw a reduction in volunteers
and staff shortages in a number of food
[SPEAKER_06]: pantries because many sort of older
seniors are those whose staff and
[SPEAKER_06]: volunteers at food pantries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So real challenge within the emergency
food world, particularly rural food
[SPEAKER_06]: pantries, preliminary reports suggest that
they've had particular difficulties with
[SPEAKER_06]: lineups and following, you know,
dealing with increased demand and
[SPEAKER_06]: addressing the kind of health requirements
and health guidelines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of the places where food is
distributed are small spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of places had to reopen and
re-adjust and find new ways of delivering
[SPEAKER_06]: food in this context.
[SPEAKER_06]: And alongside this, you know, sort of deep
challenges to the food system,
[SPEAKER_06]: we saw in New York and in Tompkins County,
as no exception, a proliferation of real
[SPEAKER_06]: creative responses and an effort to
address these needs in our communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of you may have seen,
for example, these mutual aid food boxes
[SPEAKER_06]: that were developed and placed around the
county where people would put food and
[SPEAKER_06]: other people who needed it would just come
and get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an informal system that was
developed and kind of arose out of need
[SPEAKER_06]: and interest in helping each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned, I, along with a lot of
other players put together this COVID-19
[SPEAKER_06]: food task force, which included county
government, city government, the Southern
[SPEAKER_06]: Tier, Food Bank, the Food Bank of the
Southern Tier, the CCE, Cornell Farm
[SPEAKER_06]: Workers Program.
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole range of different players came
together, working across the food system
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk about what challenges were being
faced and how to address them together.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the initiatives that came,
there was an initiative at the state level
[SPEAKER_06]: called Nourish New York, but there was a
local initiative, Nourish Tompkins,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was getting local food from local
food producers and distributing it to a
[SPEAKER_06]: number of different programs that were
trying to make sure low income households
[SPEAKER_06]: had access to healthy food during the
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cornell Farm Workers Program developed
a list of, I think it was over a thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: farm workers, their cell phone numbers,
to be able to text them information and
[SPEAKER_06]: keep them up to date.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a group of volunteers who made
homemade masks and delivered it to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There has been a real effort at delivering
local food and meals to farm workers who
[SPEAKER_06]: are in isolation because of COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some examples of some really
creative strategies for addressing these
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges during the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really a combination of nonprofits,
local food distributors, some local
[SPEAKER_06]: companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an example from a solidarity
garden that was planted with local farmers
[SPEAKER_06]: and local nonprofits to make sure that
people had access to food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some inspiring stories as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm well under my time looking at
Andy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to some initial conclusions.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Ed and Prabhu both noted, this is early
days for having strong conclusions about
[SPEAKER_06]: what's been happening in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: These initial food supply chain
disruptions and concerns about high amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of waste because of the shifts in markets,
those were the initial experiences of the
[SPEAKER_06]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there was a successful
transitioning to new markets and delivery
[SPEAKER_06]: systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say amongst many producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But serious challenges for small and
mid-sized producers and small and
[SPEAKER_06]: mid-sized food retailers in this
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I highlighted the particular vulnerability
of farm workers, both in terms of health
[SPEAKER_06]: impacts and food security impacts during
the pandemic and rising disparities,
[SPEAKER_06]: rising rates of food insecurity and rising
disparities in terms of access to healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: food.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of this points to a need to coordinate
and communicate better across local and
[SPEAKER_06]: regional food systems and strengthening
local and regional food systems,
[SPEAKER_06]: much as Ed mentioned is a priority in the
African context, a need to ensure that we
[SPEAKER_06]: have a vibrant local and regional food
system to be able to respond to these
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of shocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pandemic also highlighted the really
inspiring willingness of people to step
[SPEAKER_06]: outside of their normal roles and take on
new ones and collaborate and communicate
[SPEAKER_06]: across sectors in ways that were really
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time as highlighting the
fragility of low-income households to
[SPEAKER_06]: shocks and the lack of social safety nets
that really support households during
[SPEAKER_06]: these kinds of shocks to ensure that they
are food secure and are getting access to
[SPEAKER_06]: nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a challenge not only in India and
in Africa, but also here in New York state
[SPEAKER_06]: with people of color and low-income
households really suffering dramatically
[SPEAKER_06]: from food insecurity and lack of access to
nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though there is adequate supply still
within the food system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those would be some of the key
take-home messages that I would emphasize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one other point in terms of small
and mid-sized producers, the Nourish New
[SPEAKER_06]: York program initially really supported
large-scale producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tompkins County COVID-19 Food Task
Force really had a chance to discuss this
[SPEAKER_06]: with the New York state organizers of that
program in the hopes that the future
[SPEAKER_06]: program, if there's further efforts along
these lines, that there's an effort to try
[SPEAKER_06]: to support small and mid-sized producers
in these kinds of programs and not just
[SPEAKER_06]: focus on the food supply angle of that
program.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another take-home message to keep
an eye on small and mid-sized producers as
[SPEAKER_06]: well in these government programs for
ensuring access to healthy food.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I'm going to stop sharing my
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost at the end of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask one simple question,
and then if people have the appetite to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on for a bit, we'll keep the session
open for 10, 15 minutes so people from the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been an enormous stress test,
of course, for the agri-food systems
[SPEAKER_01]: globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some systemic weaknesses have
been identified as well as areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: unexpected strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us as a research for development
community, I'm curious if you all have
[SPEAKER_01]: some insights on how we should be doing
our jobs differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anything come up that suggests that we
need new areas of research, new forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: research collaboration, or any other
effort that really is responsive towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the resilience challenge that's been
illuminated by the COVID-19 challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all three of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn taking is welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we struggled with in the
task force was being able to identify who
[SPEAKER_06]: is vulnerable, who is struggling with food
insecurity, and how to go about
[SPEAKER_06]: identifying them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that Norman Portotillo was on the
call earlier, and he's been involved in
[SPEAKER_06]: this, trying to do a survey locally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to quickly identify who's food
insecure and how to reach them is a
[SPEAKER_06]: challenge, even in a country like the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make three very quick points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that in Africa
especially, the lack of real-time
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence on how much food is available
was just shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on, we in research, all of us,
we're happy with FAO starts from 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this pandemic hit, ministers of
agriculture were struggling to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much price is in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of that information is in the hands
of private companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just did not know how much food is
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to act and develop
policy measures when you have very little
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence on what the actual situation
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, I'll say for Africa,
where the food systems are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: informal, we underestimated how much
movement of food is related to movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of food in Africa does not move on
these 40-foot containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes by people making a trip to see my
cousin in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this much food with me,
and if I'm going from urban to rural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, I'm going to move with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you cut the movement of people,
inevitably you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact on the movement of
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as you try to disentangle the
two, they're very much intertwined,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third lesson, which requires a
little bit more research, is that really,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the first, I would say,
global pandemic that has happened when the
[SPEAKER_00]: world was globalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So occasionally we had shocks in one part
of the world and more food could move from
[SPEAKER_00]: one part into another part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really making us really look at
these resilience of localized food systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that people had started to ignore in a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always knew our rice would somehow get
grown in Canada and end up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: people would have bread in Zimbabwe,
and we didn't pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time, people were just
shocked that everybody was looking after
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first three months, all these
countries were panicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, we're going to take care of
ourselves first before we start exporting
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia, all these big countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really made this local politics and
local governments focus on local
[SPEAKER_00]: production and almost a movement back to
self-sufficiency, which has its downsides
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, but it really highlighted the
importance of localized food system in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that strikes me is as people
working in food and agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't really think too much about the
rural-urban integration, not in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: food supply chains, which you think about
a lot, but thinking about how rural
[SPEAKER_03]: households depend on income coming from
urban.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urban households back to rural households
and remittances and how crucial that
[SPEAKER_03]: income is for survival of rural households
and food security of rural households.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that connection is often missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this crisis showed very clearly that
once you cut that connection off,
[SPEAKER_03]: rural food insecurity goes to the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people think about rural areas as
self-generating food self-sufficient
[SPEAKER_03]: areas, but rural markets depend a lot on
remittances coming from urban areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the lessons that comes
up clearly is we need to think about
[SPEAKER_03]: employment security in a much bigger way
than we do right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a third of the employment
opportunities in India are casual
[SPEAKER_03]: employment without contracts, and high
risk of termination at any point,
[SPEAKER_03]: then that's not a sustainable way to
manage labor markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to think about long-term
solutions for labor markets and even think
[SPEAKER_03]: about more regional, more local
non-agricultural employment opportunities,
[SPEAKER_03]: which can then substitute for these
remittance flows that have become so
[SPEAKER_03]: crucial for survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other point I want to make is this
crisis has shown quite clearly that hunger
[SPEAKER_03]: is no longer an issue of calories.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more than enough calories to go
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we shouldn't stick to this 1960s
paradigm, which I'm sorry, agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists still stick to, which is we
don't have enough pile of grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have more than enough piles of
grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we don't have is a balanced food
system that provides for an adequate
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity of diets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's an area where we should
be thinking about a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Prabhu, Rachel, and Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me open the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chime in anybody who has a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to step away from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone's going to die soon, so I'm going
to ask this fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so much hubbub about vaccines
coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as that becomes apparent and it hits
the market, depending on price,
[SPEAKER_04]: if there are poor countries that need to
get their hands on the vaccine,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you foresee these people, these
decision makers, maybe prioritizing the
[SPEAKER_04]: vaccine over food security?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is there limitations with receiving the
vaccine that may affect food security
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up here in the next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I have a good answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first of all, yes, the question,
the point that I raised is that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking from a public expenditure
point of view, there's very much a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: sum game that people don't like to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you put money into one area,
such as health, that money has to come
[SPEAKER_00]: from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in developing countries, it's usually
education, health, and agriculture are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the biggest areas of expenditure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inevitably, there's likely to be
implications that if you put more money in
[SPEAKER_00]: health, you might be investing less in
education and in agriculture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm hoping that there's going to be a
public effort to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize that risk, which I'm glad you're
pointing out, but I'm not sure how this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends what kind of vaccine they have
and it depends what kind of country
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: My response is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: The share of agriculture and the total
budgets of most countries is so tiny now
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the share of the budget for
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other infrastructure, so it can get
worse than it is already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're already at the bottom in terms of
priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions from the floor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably you've talked a lot about
remittances and labor markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this is also relevant to
the other dimensions of global discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe let me ask you, how much of this
do you think is permanent change or not
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent, but a new normal, a new stable
state where urban jobs are deprioritized
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are back in the countryside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this just something that we limp
through and we will revert back to what
[SPEAKER_01]: things were like before the pandemic?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of this do we adapt to or how
much of it do we just endure?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see some of the students from my food
policy class here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I talk about there is the whole
structural transformation that we've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: historically with populations moving from
rural to urban areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the normal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how most developed countries have
gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where developing countries have
been going.
[SPEAKER_03]: This crisis really raises the question of
whether we can do that differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just having a chat conversation here
with David and the idea of building
[SPEAKER_03]: agro-processing industry, rural
enterprises, et cetera, as new
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities for employing rural
populations and reducing the migrant flow
[SPEAKER_03]: is a way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it can be done in a more novel
way with smartphone technologies,
[SPEAKER_03]: with ICTs and social networks and other
systems coming in now that you can create
[SPEAKER_03]: much more exciting employment
opportunities for rural youth today than
[SPEAKER_03]: you could in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely think policy community
should be thinking about this more
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add to that point there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're planning this well,
indeed, you would have a shift to focus in
[SPEAKER_00]: rural areas and rural production,
more young people going out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's much more to it that is more
maybe cultural and psychological.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at in Africa,
how many of those people in urban areas
[SPEAKER_00]: had jobs even before COVID, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this, of course, we have known
that's the law of happen to have gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimbabwe last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my cousins have moved from
urban areas, have gone back to rural areas
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still saying is the moment
this is over, we're all going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have this, even here in this
part of the world, that as soon as this is
[SPEAKER_00]: over, we're going to go back to the
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a little bit of a stickiness
to that lifestyle that would require some
[SPEAKER_00]: significant re-education and change for
people to realign and realize that the new
[SPEAKER_00]: normal is not going back to where you were
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really have this mindset that
anchors us to opportunities, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: exist or not in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a poor then low that's going to
require quite some education of especially
[SPEAKER_00]: young people to realize opportunities
could be located somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could fix it that way,
I think this would be for long term
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of both food security and
development overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can create opportunities in rural
areas as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rachel, do you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I agree that I think part of the
solution is trying to trying to support
[SPEAKER_06]: rural areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a real issue here in New York
state with slaughterhouses, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: for local livestock producers having
access to adequate places, even though
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a rise in demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: There hasn't been adequate slaughterhouse
facilities for local producers to meet
[SPEAKER_06]: that demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of a bigger picture,
which is really policies and programs
[SPEAKER_06]: which have really supported large scale
producers and large companies at the
[SPEAKER_06]: expense of small scale and mid sized
producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've really seen that in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has hollowed out rural economies
because fewer people are living in rural
[SPEAKER_06]: places.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's fewer businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's fewer businesses to support fewer
producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been devastating in general for
rural America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this pandemic has highlighted that
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would agree that supporting local and
regional food producers and distributors
[SPEAKER_06]: and food related businesses and making
these connections between local consumers
[SPEAKER_06]: getting access to healthy, diverse food
sources.
[SPEAKER_06]: And supporting a regional economy is a
very important learning that we should
[SPEAKER_06]: push for.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will require a shift in the
direction of federal and state policy in
[SPEAKER_06]: general, which has gone in the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're 15 minutes over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can probably entertain one more burning
question if there is one from the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone like to ask a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any final closing question?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, are there any parting comments
from the panel?
[SPEAKER_01]: We deeply appreciate you coming today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been a treat to hear your
perspectives on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deeply appreciate it on behalf of Soil and
Crop Sciences and the SIPS community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any parting comments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to remind everyone, this will be
recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to point other people to this
that couldn't make it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that to me, this COVID
pandemic is a new class of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: disasters that bear similarities with
things that we've heard in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got some unique aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jury is too far from out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stories that we're writing today
will have to be rewritten three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: times before we can actually fully do a
post-mortem on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just aging that these are emerging
lessons and they're far from long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons, even though we're very quick to
want to make key conclusions out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more of the effects will be
written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years from now, more volumes will be
written about this and what it did to
[SPEAKER_00]: shape the nature of food security around
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what strikes me is some of the
food security and vulnerability challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: that we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the developing world, we also see right
here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our communities are so disattached
that we work on India or Africa or the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: But cross-learning is so limited between
what's happening in the US and what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening in the developing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be really interesting to build
those bridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I would agree, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we could learn a lot from
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listening to each other's experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to thank you for inviting
us to this panel, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a pleasure to talk and to
listen to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everyone, for attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.
Bye.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
