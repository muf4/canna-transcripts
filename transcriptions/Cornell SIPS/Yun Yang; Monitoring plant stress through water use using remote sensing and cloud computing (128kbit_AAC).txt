[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vipin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone, for joining me today
to discuss my research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, I tried to make it a little bit
different with the previous talk about I
[SPEAKER_02]: recently gave at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we'll focus a little bit more on
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell from the titles,
Monitoring Pant Stress, Through Water Use
[SPEAKER_02]: Perspective, Using Remote Sensing,
and Cloud Computing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is a really nice day to
give a seminar talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Halloween and also a special Indian
festival day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Halloween, we have a trick or
treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same for our environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you treat it well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it can get spooky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we all know that the projected
population in 2050 will be a large amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also need to increase our food
production to feed this increased
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do that, we really need to
assess how the current agriculture model
[SPEAKER_02]: works to help us achieve both the food
security and also the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So studies indicated as the first figure
here that with the current agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: model, we could somehow get less for the
food security goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our impact on the environment could be
large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to transition this from the top
scenario to the second scenario,
[SPEAKER_02]: we value that we achieve the goal for both
food security and also environmental goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we really need to have innovation
in agriculture management to help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can also tell, that water is a
large component from the agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this impact could be further
compounded by the drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the drought events is getting so
hard to predict and also the drought to
[SPEAKER_02]: start to show up in areas that
historically don't experience drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: drought monitor on the top for the conus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the second panel here is for the
New York state.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we can tell, although New York state,
we don't really have those very severe
[SPEAKER_02]: drought, which is the dark red color.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have drought and the drought tends
to happen more frequent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you zoom into a certain time period
and look at when the drought happens for
[SPEAKER_02]: each of the year, you can tell that the
lines in this figure here, they are July
[SPEAKER_02]: for each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this shows that drought tends to happen
during the growing season when the crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants, needs the water to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for not just agriculture, for natural
resource, for natural environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: water is so critical because too much
water, too less water, both extreme can be
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful for agriculture and for our
natural environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially when we have drought,
the plant doesn't have enough access to
[SPEAKER_02]: the water, they start to be showing the
stress signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stress could make a lot of other
effect to develop other than just a
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a disease, the pest,
and also this eventually will impact the
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for natural forest, it will
impact the forest ecosystem serving
[SPEAKER_02]: functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for now, people like with remote
sensing, we can start to monitoring
[SPEAKER_02]: general trends and with this, this is a
USDA forest service model that they use
[SPEAKER_02]: NDVI to try to find the stress signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you find the stress signal,
then you can start to think about how you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to treat the stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one question here is NDVI is showing
like basically how green your land surface
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the plant is under stress,
it doesn't necessary to change color or to
[SPEAKER_02]: shut their leaves as the first response to
the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are really eager to look for an
earlier signal that can tell us the stress
[SPEAKER_02]: before the leaf turns to yellow or before
the leaf start to drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a process that the water goes
through the plant and return back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere and it uses the same path as
the stomata.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a similar path as the carbon
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we think before the leaf change
color, we will see a signal of water use
[SPEAKER_02]: change and which could be an earlier
signal for stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk a little bit more about
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually two terms together.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one is the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for evaporation, as you can tell,
is the water returns back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere from different surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the transpiration is the more
biological part of the water use,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is go through, which is the amount
of water that the plant extract from the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, then return that back to the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combining these two, we call these
processes together as evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the second largest component
in the hydrological cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the first one is the
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about evapotranspiration,
actually, historically, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: parameter is hard to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to model, especially if you
consider the difference between potential
[SPEAKER_02]: ET and actual ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of previous studies, we use
potential ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the rate per pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because it was just easier to
calculate it from the meteorological
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is key difference between
this two terminology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the potential ET is the ideal condition
and how much water can be returned back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell, if it's sunny,
if it's windy, and if it's dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would expect a higher potential ET
because the atmosphere just needs a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the demand, which is mostly for
the potential ET part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whether we can provide that much water
to return back to atmosphere, so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the limitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Combining both the demand and the
limitation together is the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the limitation part, we need to
consider whether we have enough water in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil to support this and whether the
vegetation is health and the stomata is
[SPEAKER_02]: all open and ready to do the
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also how rough the surface is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil surface and also the canopy
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these can impact actual
evapotranspiration, which is the AET.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today I will talk about the AET and I
will go through the methods that we
[SPEAKER_02]: improved, developed, improved,
and also the product that we developed and
[SPEAKER_02]: also applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first we'll talk about the algorithm
for the actual evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there are, you know,
now with machine learning, there are a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are this process-based model and it
can be also machine learning data-driven
[SPEAKER_02]: model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here what I'm going to talk about is
energy balance model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why is energy balance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about, you know, like in physics,
there are actually a lot of assumptions is
[SPEAKER_02]: the balance, a mass conservation,
you know, energy conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the energy balance method is we assume
the natural radiation we get, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy we get on the earth's surface,
it will be partitioned into three energy
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is how much energy is stored in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another part is how much energy is
used to change the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you feel it's hot outside or
it's cold outside, that's the sensible
[SPEAKER_02]: heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest of that is the latent
heat, which is the energy used to transfer
[SPEAKER_02]: the water from the soil or water surface
back to a vapor condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which is the part of the energy that is
used for evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a lot of this energy balance models,
we actually calculate this latent heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the OE term there, as a residual
of the system, because it's just so hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to directly estimate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here I'm showing you one of these
energy balance model, which is called
[SPEAKER_02]: Alexey Disselexe model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the model that I have been
work on since my post-op.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was developed by my post-op
advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this model, it actually has two
components.
[SPEAKER_02]: One component is on the coarse resolution,
which is Alexey model.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we have this is because to have
this energy closure, we need to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: system that you can consider the closure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to consider this system, we need the
atmospheric boundary layer condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the hard part to get,
so that we rely on the geostationary data,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the weather forecast satellite in
the space, because it's coarse resolution,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's very frequent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from that, we can grab the information
of the atmospheric boundary layer
[SPEAKER_02]: development information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can have a closed system to
consider the energy balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the coarse resolution part,
one key input is the land surface
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this goes to the cooling effect of
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to use this example in the
hot summer days.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you sweat, actually your skin is
cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the same for vegetation
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have water transferred back to
atmosphere, it uses the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has the cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your leaf surface will be cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why land surface temperature is
a very important parameter that we use in
[SPEAKER_02]: the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, we also need to know the
conditions of land surface, which we use
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetation index.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know where the vegetation is and
where we know that their soil is,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can estimate E and T,
because E is from different surfaces and T
[SPEAKER_02]: is from the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the coarse resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the finer spatial resolution,
we call it desegregation of Alexi,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is dysalexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for dysalexy, we borrow this air,
T air estimation for the boundary
[SPEAKER_02]: condition that we estimated from Alexi and
use that in the dysalexy, but change the
[SPEAKER_02]: land surface temperature and vegetation
indexing input to a finer spatial
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution satellite data, which now we
use land fat, equal stress, and weirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are different satellites in the
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can see this is really a
hierarchical structure that involves the
[SPEAKER_02]: satellite data from different spatial
resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for satellite data, normally if it's
different spatial resolution, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different in temporal resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temporal resolution meaning is how
often it comes back to the same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also call this as revisiting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combining all these different
satellites together, we can estimate
[SPEAKER_02]: evapotranspiration at different spatial
and temporal resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, closer spatial resolution has
more frequent revisiting, and the finer
[SPEAKER_02]: spatial resolution has a longer revisiting
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell, that for a lot of
agriculture applications, what we need is
[SPEAKER_02]: high in both, in both spatial resolution
and in both in temporal resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we came up with a data
fusion method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can combine the advantages of high
frequency from course resolution data and
[SPEAKER_02]: the high spatial resolution observations
from those satellites that they don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a very frequent revisiting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combining all this, we want to get a
daily field scale evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_02]: estimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will give a little bit more about
this data fusion, like multi-source data
[SPEAKER_02]: system, because I want to guess a little
bit new things in my slides that I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my interview talk and also another
talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is different sources of land
surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we identified that land surface
temperature is really important to input
[SPEAKER_02]: for our energy balance model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the satellites that we are
currently using, which the first is
[SPEAKER_02]: geostationary one is the GOES data,
the weather satellite for the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, MODIS and WEIRS is polar orbit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polar orbit means they go through the
polar part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the MODIS and WEIRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spatial resolution is 500 meter,
but is daily revisiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Landsat has been a really golden
observations for us working on field of
[SPEAKER_02]: scale because it provides 30 meter spatial
resolution but the revisiting time is
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively longer because it's 16 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we have two Landsat in the space,
Landsat 8 and Landsat 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combining these two together,
we can get the revisiting time to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the ISS orbit is the EcoStress
sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: EcoStress is a thermal only sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it only measures the land surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the International Space Station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's on the International Space
Station, so it goes to a very different
[SPEAKER_02]: orbit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So revisiting time is about four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also considering that in the future,
we also have multiple sensors that is
[SPEAKER_02]: planned in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the Trishnak from European
and Landsat NEXT, which will be launched
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2030, which will be launched by NASA
and hosted by USGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why we need all these data together,
this is a simple identification of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different data, their frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this area actually is for California.
[SPEAKER_02]: California is already clear during green
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see a more added value actually
for a cloudy area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first one, Landsat 8 and 9,
which is the key input currently for a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of operational product of ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Sentinel-2 is the European satellite,
which doesn't have thermal observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't measure land surface
temperature, but we can get vegetation
[SPEAKER_02]: index from Sentinel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And EcoStress is thermal only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just measures land surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So combine these all together,
we can see a lot more samples that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: get over a green season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which can help us to better estimate
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't have satellite
observations, you can only do is
[SPEAKER_02]: interpolate between the two days that you
have observation, which is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ideal condition is we can get
observation for each day, but there will
[SPEAKER_02]: be a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also comparing with the Landsat and
EcoStress, this is how many clear images
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can use for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: With darker color, it's more images over
that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see Landsat really have limited
images.
[SPEAKER_02]: And combining with EcoStress, there are a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the difference is we use the number of
EcoStress minus the number of Landsat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can get the number of how many more
images we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, okay, so we have all
these satellite observations, and there
[SPEAKER_02]: will be more in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you can directly use them
together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they are so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key difference is the spatial
resolution is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell that Landsat 8,
EcoStress and WEIRS, this is the relative
[SPEAKER_02]: the image from the sensor, and they get
coarse and coarse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want is field scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the WEIRS data,
you don't really tell the field anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we need to do is we need to first
unify the land surface temperature from
[SPEAKER_02]: different sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we use the data mining sharpener,
which is a machine learning based method.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the land surface temperature,
which we can sharpen the coarse resolution
[SPEAKER_02]: of land surface temperature to a field
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can put this as input into our
model to estimate field scale
[SPEAKER_02]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so now with all these, you know,
satellite method, energy balance,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we actually want to get is a 30 meter
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evapotranspiration estimation so that we
can use it for different applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we are going to start with some
applications because this talk will focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant stress detect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will use our backyard work at California
as an example to demonstrate how we detect
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stress using evapotranspiration
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a Green Pax project,
which is a collaboration between NASA E&G
[SPEAKER_02]: Gallo and USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the project lead is Bill Kostas and
also Marsha Anderson was my coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a project that we have been
working on for many years actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the sites that we selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are E&G Gallo vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for each of the sites, we have
observation capabilities, the instrument.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flux tower, phenocamp, all these
observations built in these sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we evaluate our model to
evapotranspiration for each of the sites
[SPEAKER_02]: by comparing with the flux tower
observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it can give us confidence how we
can further use the model of the
[SPEAKER_02]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can tell that the dots here are
observations and the red line is our
[SPEAKER_02]: simulated data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a 30 meter field scale ET,
which performs very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than just look at how it works
for these flux tower, we can also look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the spatial pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the cumulative ET for this
vineyard area and start from the start of
[SPEAKER_02]: the green season and all the way to the
peak of the green season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can tell how these different fields
they start to use a different amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation over the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also these are the vineyard and there
are also natural trees over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very useful for the growers that
they can look at this spatial map to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how the different water is
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how this water use can be transferred
to a stress signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually using a very simple anomaly
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the anomaly normally compares with a
baseline, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a long-term observation,
you know the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for each of the data comes,
you can compare that ET value with the
[SPEAKER_02]: baseline and that can give you a signal of
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we are not actually directly
comparing the ET value because ET changes
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just impacted by the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of actually is impacted by the
weather, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Today and tomorrow the plant won't change
much, but you probably see the ET change a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot if today is sunny and tomorrow is
cloudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we normalized the evapotranspiration
use the reference ET to remove this day by
[SPEAKER_02]: day difference of the weather condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we use this ratio to calculate the
FRET anomaly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the index that we use to
capture the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one example of one of the
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the top is this FRET value.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red lines are our model to the black
dots are the observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use these data to look at these
abnormal values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you compare this abnormal values
with the vineyard management, you will see
[SPEAKER_02]: all these differences comparing with
normal condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's due to the drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can tell the California drought,
sometimes it's due to the management.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, this is a time period that
the graft and the trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use this anomaly index to help us
identify what's different comparing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this, we can look at the spatial
pattern of water used for different years
[SPEAKER_02]: among different monsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we use this value to minus
the baseline, we can clearly tell which
[SPEAKER_02]: part is not performing as supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is different as of what baseline
tell you that the red color means it's
[SPEAKER_02]: lower than the baseline, which gave you a
signal of either the plant needs water
[SPEAKER_02]: because they are using less amount of
water or there is also a signal that there
[SPEAKER_02]: might be some kind of disease or pests for
those fields that impacted the plant water
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then growers can use this map to look at
to the field to look at the field for
[SPEAKER_02]: further management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So GripHex is a large project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is very exciting is actually just
this Tuesday and Wednesday, a few leaders
[SPEAKER_02]: of the GripHex project visited us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Katie Gold from the Horticulture and
me, we together hosted them at Geneva
[SPEAKER_02]: campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell, Bill Kustas,
Martha Anderson, Joe Alferi are here to
[SPEAKER_02]: visit our Geneva vineyard site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also part of my new research
that I want to bring the GripHex
[SPEAKER_02]: experience to our New York vineyard
growers and to see under different climate
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions with different varieties of
grapes, how much we learned from GripHex
[SPEAKER_02]: can help the growers in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully next time I will have some
results for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are planning a flux tower over one
of Katie's field site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she has the disease measurement and I
will have the water and carbon flux
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collectively, I think we will have a lot
of interesting findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so other than the crops,
actually, I also did a lot of work for
[SPEAKER_02]: natural forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of time, I'm not going to talk
about this in detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did use this water use information
to help us to understand plantation
[SPEAKER_02]: management, the thinning, harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the signals that you can
find from water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all published papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested, you can look at
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll look at Missouri forest draw to
impact and also how the forest
[SPEAKER_02]: compositions and management impact
different water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the restoration of different
kinds in the southeast area, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: large conservation effort in southeast
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also wildfire impact over the west of
US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the works that we have
published.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can tell that we spend a lot of
time to explore how we can use this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people start to adapt to this
method, there's new issue is how we can
[SPEAKER_02]: provide people the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is very commercial resource
intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a local server, we cannot estimate
a large area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why a few earlier studies,
you can tell they are just limited with
[SPEAKER_02]: small area, because just we cannot run it
for a large area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how we can provide this regional data
to people who are interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another key project that I also
have been working on for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm super excited to see how this
project turned to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the opening key project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started with a lot of collaboration
efforts from different government agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: and universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually at that time, we started to
think how we can provide this data to the
[SPEAKER_02]: end users, not just in the scientific
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we brought our model
into the cloud, which is the Google Earth
[SPEAKER_02]: Engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we integrated six different ET models
into Google Earth Engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can directly do all the
estimations in the cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing need to be done locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is in the cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results are safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to make the accessible of the data,
we also developed a reference,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is opendata.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can look at the water use from
different fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also developed the API that people
can directly download images and time
[SPEAKER_02]: series, do a little bit more advanced data
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the six models that we have is these
well-established six models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alexi Dislexi was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have another ensemble value,
because a lot of times users, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need six values, especially when these six
values are all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want one value, which is ensemble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also studied a lot how to get to
this ensemble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went through careful evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the evaluation results turned out that
the ensemble actually performs the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is also what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have published another
evaluation paper that was published
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier this year on nature water,
which is also the cover page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from this study, we evaluated our open
ET product comparing with the different
[SPEAKER_02]: flux towers all across the conus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that paper have very detailed
information about the performance of
[SPEAKER_02]: different models and the performance of
models at different locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have the ET data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still like work very hard to expand
this to the east.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I think we have a little bit more
but didn't get to the New York state yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the multi-source data
could be very helpful for the next stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we all know the eastern US is
cloudier than the western US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll need more satellites to work on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is if you get to the open ET
website, you can zoom into the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have filled boundary there,
you can look out to the water use for each
[SPEAKER_02]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently we have data from 2016 to
present, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we have this API there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it to download data if you're
interested to explore in a certain area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also building this Farms tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: To use this Farms tool, farmers can bring
their own boundary shape file into the
[SPEAKER_02]: platform so that they can get routinely
report of their field's water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do see there's limited of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to show you that with the
open ET, we are not limited to small
[SPEAKER_02]: areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do regional studies but still keep
this fine spatial resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a study that my PhD student,
she's currently working on, look at lower
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi alluvial plant agriculture
activities and how these activities impact
[SPEAKER_02]: the water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the study area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along the Mississippi River,
you can see the highly cultivated area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use the open ET data to analyze for
these different crop types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soybean is a green color, corn,
cotton, and rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How these different crops use different
amount of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we can get a very typical plant
water use curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the average for multiple years,
which means that a lot of weeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we observed in the field,
that the yellow line corn, it shows a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher water use during the first stage of
the green stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cotton doesn't need that much
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we got statistically from
the open ET data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can also look at the water
accounting for this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same as you understand your bank
account, we also want to understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: water account.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water we used at different
locations and how much water is used
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted from groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: The groundwater information is this blue
bar that shows all negative value.
[SPEAKER_02]: The negative value is always withdrawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that also explains why this area we see
a consistent groundwater depletion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for these drought years, we do see a
higher groundwater withdrawal to maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: the agriculture activity over this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we can also look at the spatial
pattern for a different area that tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: use different amount of water over a green
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the same area, starts from May
all the way to August.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the top is leaf area index.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second panel is the
evapotranspiration, which is the water
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will try to go quick because this
will be something I will further work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third panel is very high resolution
ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 30 meters sometimes can be limited
for specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a vineyard from Katie's field that
we do need finer spatial resolution
[SPEAKER_02]: details.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of my group's work is using UAV
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we fly drones to collect images.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can really get very detailed
information on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a two-site fully irrigated and
deficit site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how these are input to be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is our evapotranspiration
estimation, the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also tell how different the
evapotranspiration use for the fully
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigated deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are next to each other, but they are
very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a three-meter
evapotranspiration data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a 30-meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can tell why we want to go a
little bit further.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be fine for farm belt field
crops, but for a lot of the specialty
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, we do need a finer spatial
resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: My group is also working on a deep
learning method to help us directly
[SPEAKER_02]: sharpen the open ET 30-meter data using
planet observations to get a three-meter
[SPEAKER_02]: ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the specialty crop management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with now a lot of interest from
different fields that they want to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at, either the water use or plant response
or water accounting, you can see there are
[SPEAKER_02]: new ET data every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see new publications every day
using ET or try to produce ET.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with a lot of these new effort,
how we can have a standard to evaluate
[SPEAKER_02]: these new data.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I just change a model applied to an
area, can I claim it as a new model or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether my evaluation method is a standard
method?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no standard now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm currently doing is I'm leading
a group of scientists internationally from
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries, Australia,
China, Europe, that we are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what's the current status of
the satellite-based evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through this AGU talk, we will further
establish a working group that will work
[SPEAKER_02]: together to get a protocol to help the
entire remote sensing community to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: standard for the ET data evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this, I'm going to conclude my
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically the take-home messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend a lot of effort to make this as a
product open to the public, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: open to the users.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this data can be used for a lot
of applications, water accounting,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stress detection, on-farm
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are still working on a lot more of
this exciting applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to thank my funding
agencies for all this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have time for... Yeah, Johannes,
we do have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That question about data ownership,
you mentioned the aspirationist and
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence for it, that it's open,
accessible, but who owns the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with Google Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google probably uses the data for all
kinds of things and maybe claims some
[SPEAKER_01]: ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the conversations about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I trust actually governments any
better, especially when the past is
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially coming upon us next week,
but who can be trusted with these very
[SPEAKER_01]: important public goods?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you and your colleagues are
talking about ownership of these data for
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you so much for this important
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is about ownership of the
OpenET data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a lot of discussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we actually have now is we are
trying to define a better intelligence
[SPEAKER_02]: property certificate for this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is like a more computer science
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a bunch of these IP certificates
we can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later we choose one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number, I cannot recall it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we choose one of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that data is open and people can grab
it to modify it, which I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: whether we want to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But further actually, the OpenET group,
we formed a non-profit organization,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are having a non-profit organization
that we have board member.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the capability to raise funds to
allocate the funding between different
[SPEAKER_02]: science teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how the Google Earth engine is
involved, I don't think they really claim
[SPEAKER_02]: the ownership.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do see the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because among our in-group discussion,
we discussed a lot about when Google Earth
[SPEAKER_02]: engine is going to start to charge us and
how much it will charge us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the discussion about OpenAI is
very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so far Google Earth engine has been
supportive, but we had some discussions
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like most of the applications
have been focused on sort of water stress
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crops.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in upstate New York, we often might
have the other problem where we have too
[SPEAKER_00]: much water.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking about soil and nitrous
oxide loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if this tool could be useful
for making field level predictions as to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of timing of fertilizer application
or spatial distribution of fertilizer to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to minimize them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find wet spots and then avoid those wet
spots or wet ponds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this will be a very interesting
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, like through the last two
days workshop with the Green Pax team,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were thinking about because for the
vineyard here, not just like field crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyard, apple orchard, they all have
this more water issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were thinking about to explore the
data to see whether the higher ET could be
[SPEAKER_02]: related to some of these, like what you
talked about, the on-farm management and
[SPEAKER_02]: could be linked with the pests and
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be, I think, something new to
the ET community to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
