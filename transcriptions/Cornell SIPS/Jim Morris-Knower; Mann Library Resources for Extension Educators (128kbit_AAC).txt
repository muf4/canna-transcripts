[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: The library's liaison to cooperative
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of work with extension
educators around the state, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to help them find the information
they need to do their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, and what I think I might do
just briefly is just show you an online
[SPEAKER_00]: guide that I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a, I think it's, I think I
still call it a portal, but the term
[SPEAKER_00]: portal is like, it sounds like 1995 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a little, but the idea is
that it's an online resource that's easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to, that sort of collects together
a lot of the resources that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: to extension folks through Cornell and
through the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I might try to do is share
my screen just to show that briefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a kind of a quick overview of it,
and then I'll just open it up to questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the portal, which is pretty easy
to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the URL is up here, guides
.library.cornell.edu, underscore cce,
[SPEAKER_00]: slash cceunders.
[SPEAKER_00]: underscore portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do Cornell Cooperative
Extension man library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll just Google it and it'll
come up, but, and I won't go into too much
[SPEAKER_00]: detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you actually may be familiar with
this already, but what I tried to do here
[SPEAKER_00]: is collect all the resources and services
that extension staff have access to both
[SPEAKER_00]: the online resources, which, you know,
I think most everyone in corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: extension, unless you're really new,
you understand that you are considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: full Cornell staff member in terms of
access to the Cornell resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of electronic resources
that we, Cornell pays a subscription to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get access to if you're
current Cornell faculty, staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: or students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that includes all Cooperative Extension
staff members within NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get access to all of the
resources that are available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just again, it kind of goes through
what you can do in terms of finding books
[SPEAKER_00]: and journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this, a lot of these resources
are available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to remember for what it's
worth is if you search the Cornell library
[SPEAKER_00]: online catalog and find books that are in
print, we still have a lot of really high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality resources that are available in
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find those using our catalog and
they're here at Mann Library, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually order those and have them
delivered through the mail for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the electronic resources,
but they're actual, the print resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: the books that we have, if you need that
and it's not readily available in your
[SPEAKER_00]: local library, that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that is overviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a further explanation in the
document delivery section right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link here under library
services, so I won't go into too much
[SPEAKER_00]: detail about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final section, there's a lot of
information here, so when you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: time, just go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think ultimately, let me go switch back
here, so I'm kind of going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This link, my picture here with my link,
actually, if you click on it, you can send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if all else fails or even from
the beginning, you're like, I just need
[SPEAKER_00]: help finding information for this grant
I'm putting together or this program I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: putting together or I need to do
evidence-based programming, that seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email and I'll either know the
resource or the answer or I'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to, so that's just on the
first page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's JPK 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not some great secret or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under tutorials here at the very
end, this is where I put together this top
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 things every Cooperative Extension
staff member should know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I do in person for
new Extension staff when they come,
[SPEAKER_00]: those who come to campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do this in person and kind of go
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the interest of time,
I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will tell you is that each one of
these is a link to a variety of resources
[SPEAKER_00]: that I, these aren't everything you have
available, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just a scratching the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's some of the more
important ones to know from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: including my email right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also put some guides here,
which can be useful, very specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: focused guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them my colleagues have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is this finding funding and
this seems to be, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: training, the webinars, the outreach I've
done to Cooperative Extension staff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of years, the funding piece,
not surprisingly, seems to be one of great
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just click on this link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just recently, let me see if
this, so I've recently just updated this
[SPEAKER_00]: to include crowdfunding sources of
information, which is a relatively new
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a way of basically passing the
hat virtually online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cornell Library has some
electronic books that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to order them from the
library.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually just log on and read
crowdfunding for dummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, I've focused on New York
State, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: federal, and private philanthropic sources
of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do webinars on the foundation
directory, which is the primary index to
[SPEAKER_00]: private and corporate funders,
the ones with, you know, you think Gates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think Rockefeller, those, the big
funding, the big sources of, and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller local foundations,
which can have money as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the foundation directory is the most
important source for that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that link is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a subscription database,
so it's not freely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, everyone in Cooperative Extension
does have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some online tutorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I think we, oh yeah,
in 2012, I think I gave one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars and I recorded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 30 minutes and I walk through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee that it's the most
professionally done thing, but it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you the basic sense of what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you start to use it and
have questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, hi, this is Jen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a, I think a program leadership
development cohort and you did,
[SPEAKER_02]: you kind of did a sit down with us and
helped us look through the foundations
[SPEAKER_02]: directory and set up alerts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that a lot of us are now
spending a good chunk of time either
[SPEAKER_02]: searching for funding, writing grants,
or administering those grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I can speak for myself that a
little bit less time now on programming
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little more time on finding funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you brought up a great point is
that now as we are engaging in this
[SPEAKER_02]: funding, it is really important to be able
to find things like evidence-based
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and that kind of support
material for the grant writing that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even know where to begin with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's, you know, you need the grant
funding to do the programming and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to have a plan with
evidence of your program to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost this catch 22, you know,
like, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you look for the, and you have to do
them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the, the foundation directory
and those other sources are really great
[SPEAKER_00]: to know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in terms of doing the
evidence-based and finding the evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly can, I can help folks with
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the research, I tried to tell
Cornell undergraduates this and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm not sure it might go in one
ear and out the other, but the research
[SPEAKER_00]: process takes time to do it well,
to actually find things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets better the more you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, doing, finding that
evidence can, it's not just like you type
[SPEAKER_00]: it into Google and, you know, the top
three hits are exactly what you need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, support what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does get easier and I can certainly
help with that process and maybe save you
[SPEAKER_00]: some time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, I think, and also since we
are working along, you know, within our
[SPEAKER_02]: mission or within our priority areas,
that sometimes you start to build a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a kind of system of knowledge or a bunch
of ideas and practices and be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow those down there, you know,
to try to build a, what am I trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, almost a library of ideas that you
have now drawing from for grant funding
[SPEAKER_02]: and writing, writing those grants,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's, there is a,
there is an opportunity and a challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: here to tap into the collective experience
of all the Cooperative Extension educators
[SPEAKER_00]: across the state or even beyond,
you know, about how is it you successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: go about, in terms of, specifically in
terms of the funding, how is it that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and sometimes you can,
one of the things you can do, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably showed you guys this for your
leadership cohort, you can go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation directory and find what other,
you know, other county Cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension agencies, what grants they've
gotten and for what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but there is this,
there is a possibility for this
[SPEAKER_00]: collective, like you said, a library of
knowledge about how, how to do this well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even relevant, you know, papers that
really speak to what we do and because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much out there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you find, you know, it's a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually, they're now,
it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know here at Cornell, I mean,
I'm not really knowledgeable about the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole, the scholarship behind like
evidence-based methodologies, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: now offering, I think in the College of
Human Ecology, they're offering a minor in
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence-based research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's something that is
obviously being, you know, it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: considered really more seriously at that
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have recently had kind of funding
questions from partners we work with and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're coming down kind of above from
their funders saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't really want to follow through
with this project if there isn't an
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence-based practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not just talking about
something that was just research.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for something kind of like
a cookie cutter program that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: instituted somewhere, has got good
research behind it and the good evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that it worked, you know, that kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different meaning than
evidence-based that, oh, I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is, that is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I, again, I'm,
I'm outside the loop on this, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: just seems that what works for in terms of
an evidence-based programming for,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a 4-H program in Utah isn't
necessarily going to work for the same 4-H
[SPEAKER_00]: program in Onondaga County in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just, there's all manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The notion of a cookie cutter and it's,
it's, it's an ambitious idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then conversely, it's kind of throw
the baby out with a bath water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a promising practice,
something that looks like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a lot of good research
behind these ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it doesn't have some
evidence-based template to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, no, that's not going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I do this all the time with my,
with my teaching that I work with faculty
[SPEAKER_00]: in the two colleges, CALS and human
ecology, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're being asked, the library and the
librarians are being asked to do more
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of what we do, you know,
to, to actually assess how effective they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, when the faculty member says,
if I talk to the faculty member after the
[SPEAKER_00]: class and they say, you know, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I can see the,
it was really useful to the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that's, that's a really very,
that's a primary piece of assessment of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, that's not a rubric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it's not something I can put
in Excel and show somebody and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% of the students who took my workshop
did, you know, seven significantly better
[SPEAKER_00]: on their final exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the level, you know,
but for me, that more qualitative
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of the, of the word of mouth
from the faculty member is all I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, my funding is not based on
needing to get those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in a lot of times,
if people are giving you money,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be able to report back and
say, this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody can check off their little
box.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a strange, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand where it has to do,
but in the real world that getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to people is what we're,
we're after, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If other people are also spending time
gathering research to support their work,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is there a way we can share that
in a, in some forum or is it already being
[SPEAKER_01]: done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I, and, and the sharing,
what you're basically doing is sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: published research on the, on this topic,
you know, basically journal articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what key research findings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be, that will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, yeah, what I would recommend,
and I've worked with a number of other,
[SPEAKER_00]: either lab groups or groups on campus to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is you can start,
and if you had a group, you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be in the same office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to, you can do this
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a program called
Zotero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free online program, Z-O-T-E-R-O
dot O-R-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can, I can pull, let me actually
see, let me see if I can show you an
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, what's the, well, actually
there's one, there's, oh, not survey
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: System of Rice Intensification.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is through CFAD and
international programs, but what they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have done is, and I've helped
them do this, they put together this
[SPEAKER_00]: online database of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a, not to get in too much
detail, but the System of Rice
[SPEAKER_00]: Intensification is a, is a system of
increasing the yields of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly controversial, and one of the
things this group wanted to do was show
[SPEAKER_00]: the evidence speaking of evidence from
published research on the effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_00]: this system of growing rice called SRI or
System of Rice Intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did, and I'll actually just
do a search for rice because, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: Zotero, and what they've done is they've
put together this online library that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are probably two or three people
in the group who are administrators who
[SPEAKER_00]: oversee this and add material to the
library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's completely open to anybody
in the world, and what it, it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's greatest interface, but it's very
logical that, you know, you can organize
[SPEAKER_00]: these, the library is organized into some
subfolders, and then each one of these is
[SPEAKER_00]: the link to an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how you want to do it,
you can include the full text of the
[SPEAKER_00]: article as well, and there's no limit in
terms of the number of people who can be
[SPEAKER_00]: in this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, it, it works, it's a, it takes a
little bit to learn the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think for the kind of program you're
talking about, this, this could be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective solution, and I'd, if you,
if you want to explore it, I'm happy to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you get going with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, that is helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is this a good way if somebody's
trying to research a topic to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: gather, you know, their effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you could do is if there are,
you know, what I possibly could imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a core group of you in the,
in your group who are doing the research
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you know, a particular topic within
your field, and you wanted to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboratively this database and share it
among yourselves, and then also with the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public, that's exactly what you
could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program, let me actually,
let me open up, so what you do is you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the program on your individual computer,
and I'll slide this over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a desktop program, let me slide
this over here, and you work on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: computer, and you would do your research
in whatever database you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my, this is my desktop version
of Zotero, and I've got these folders
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and if I scroll down here,
when I get into this section here,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the group libraries,
so I can, the other nice thing about this
[SPEAKER_00]: is I can have my individual research that
I collect here, this is only for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then under here I got these group
libraries that you could share,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if there are, say, four or five or six,
there's no limit on the number,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if, if there were four of you who
wanted to create a group library,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have, I could add, I could do my
own research on this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the group on bees, and if I did my
own research and imported these
[SPEAKER_00]: references, I went and did it,
I would add them to the library here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the program, you can see this
little arrow is circling over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's doing is it's syncing with the
cloud, so what would happen is this bee
[SPEAKER_00]: group online, which is what everyone could
access, would be a place where people
[SPEAKER_00]: could then go and see the results,
but, so it works, these group libraries,
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well for collaboration between
people, and then also sharing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make it, you could keep it private
if you wanted to, and just share it among
[SPEAKER_00]: your small group, but it sounds like you
might also want to make this open to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public, not that they could add or edit
it, but they could see it, and they could
[SPEAKER_00]: download the program, it's, you know,
it's actually very, and you don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the program installed, or even know
how it works to be able to go in and see
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the results of these, you know,
this is, again, this is the online
[SPEAKER_00]: version, this is the desktop version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the questions we often have is
our gardening topic area can sort of go in
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of directions, is there people
who could, you know, guide us on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of organize the, you know,
do we have one big folder, or do we,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a structural way that seems to
work better than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the, you're collecting all
the research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because, you know, we could be in
lots of different fields, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one, you know, bees is a common,
pollinators in general is a common topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can go to the, a different
area where, as Jen was suggesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, childhood obesity and growing
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so, yeah, I was, I was gonna say,
I can tell you what the program can do
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in this Cornell
Conservation Agriculture, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the Cornell Conservation
Agriculture is another example of one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these working live databases from a CALS
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they create a master library called
Cornell Conservation Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then within that, they've created all
these sub-folders that, and it can range
[SPEAKER_00]: on anything, and, you know, and you can,
you can actually, so if I look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: level, if I highlight Cornell Conservation
Agriculture, I'm looking at everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the library, which is probably,
at this point, thousands of citations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if I click on one of these,
like if I click under Cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only looking at the citations that
have been stored in Cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can create all these sub-folders,
and then you can actually put,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single, a particular citation,
so this is a journal article right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this reference could be in more than one
of these folders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could, you could have as many of
these sub-folders as you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not, everybody is tempted to
have a folder called miscellaneous,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is dangerous, because it's
like, I don't know where, but let's put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in miscellaneous, and then it just ends up
being, so anyway, the tools for organizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it are there, I'm not, I would love to be,
but I am not personally a particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: organized person, so I'm not sure how that
best works, it's probably something for
[SPEAKER_00]: your group to hash out how this might,
how this might work, but I think Zotero in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself kind of gives you the ability to,
at a certain level be, to be fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: organized about it, and then just to,
let me actually see, so here is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: system of rights intensification,
and again, this is on my desktop,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm showing you right now,
this is the desktop program, but here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the master folder, and then here are all
the sub-folders, and everything's doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if I go back here, there's
exactly, so this is, this is the online
[SPEAKER_00]: view, this is sort of the shared view that
everyone sees, this is exactly the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, so here's the master library,
and then here are the sub-folders that
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can choose to make this,
include the full text of the article,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do that, you can't make it,
for copyright reasons obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't make the folder a fully public
one, you would need to make, a public view
[SPEAKER_00]: would not include the full text,
so that's a small consideration,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about that, Jim,
then would people be able to, like people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are in the folder be able to print
those out, or would they just use them as
[SPEAKER_02]: a reference and then go find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, they could, if they wanted to,
if they wanted to take these, if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: the Zotero program, you could join the
group, that's the other thing is you could
[SPEAKER_00]: make it so that people could join the
group and download this into their own
[SPEAKER_00]: folder, but a lot of times people are
just, they don't want to be bothered with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, so you can see here, I'm pretty
sure, if I marked all these records,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could then export them, and here are
different options, let me actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be the best, that's actually
exporting it in a format, let me see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a way, I think there should be
just a way to, to print them out if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to, or email them to yourself,
I'll have to look into that, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, oh, this is interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, okay, so you can, if nothing else,
if you wanted to, you could do this quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could select a style, like APA style,
and then do a, oops, if I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, okay, I could just copy them all and
paste them into my, like a Word document
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, but there has to
be an email function here somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look into that, so yeah,
people could print them out, people could
[SPEAKER_00]: email them, they should be able to email
themselves, and then go, go and find them,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're in the Cornell network,
it's pretty easy to do it, sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in this case, this is a publicly
available PDF, so they could just,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh, well, doesn't always work the way you
planned, yeah, so, URLs change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this stuff is available,
right, through the, through the Men
[SPEAKER_02]: Library portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely, yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's really cool, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that being helpful to a lot of
educators, if that was, essentially,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of curated by our needs,
you know, we've, and each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: we figure it out, but then, as we come
across these things, they could get added,
[SPEAKER_02]: not that we have another, another moment
of time to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I know, exactly, but if you did,
I mean, if you're doing this anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will actually save you a lot of time,
because all you would then need to do is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nice thing is, is you can go into
your database of choice, like Scholar,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I wanted to Google Scholar,
and I did, you know, let me just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say community gardening, or something
like that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, the nice thing about the program
is, so I'm in Chrome, on a Windows-based
[SPEAKER_00]: computer, and I've got Zotero installed,
and there's this little folder here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I click on this, and then I can just
grab all of those citations, and bring,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where they'll end up, I'm not gonna
bring them in right now, but where they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: end up is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I dump them there,
and then it's, so all I need to do is go
[SPEAKER_00]: to my database, do my search, these are
probably things you're doing already,
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of your workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, click the import, which is just
clicking a button, point it, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: either, if you've got the folder
highlighted, when you do the import,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just dump them right in there,
and then when you, when this thing syncs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it will do automatically,
what, so those records I brought in from
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Scholar will then, end up in my
online library here, automatically shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're just doing a lot
of these things anyway, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: curating and collecting the references,
it would, once you learn the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it installed, and figured out the
particularities of doing the shared
[SPEAKER_00]: management of this, you're not really,
I don't, you're really not adding much in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of your workflow, and then you're
saving, in terms of the export,
[SPEAKER_00]: and making it publicly available,
and sharing it, you're saving all your
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and not having to do that part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd turn it out to the rest of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think having that kind of
information, like the garden-based
[SPEAKER_02]: learning page already has some,
and I think a lot of us as educators have
[SPEAKER_02]: tapped into those articles that are
referenced there, but would having
[SPEAKER_02]: something like this be helpful as we,
you know, A, defend kind of what it is
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do, and when we talk to others
about what we do, and then also as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: writing grant proposals, question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would say, just,
and this is definitely a conversation for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you to have among yourselves,
whether this would be an effective tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to think about doing it on
a very small scale, like create,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a proof of concept for
yourselves, create a small, like one
[SPEAKER_00]: folder with 20 references in it,
and put it, and see what it seems to,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it seem to work, and does it seem
like you would want to put everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing into this database,
so you might want to start in a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other, and I sound a bit like an
infomercial, except I'm not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: selling anything, the thing you can also
do with the program, which is really nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: so for like grant-based programs,
is once you get your references in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: then if you needed to, or if in any
situation where you needed to share these
[SPEAKER_00]: references, so I'm just gonna take these
particular ones here, if I go create
[SPEAKER_00]: bibliography from items, and I'll just
take APA, and then if I go into,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's a blank Word document,
let me slide this over here, so I copied
[SPEAKER_00]: those, and then I just paste them in,
so I've created, really quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could have an annotated
bibliography if you want, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a list of your sources that you could
include in an annual report, or a grant
[SPEAKER_00]: project, or whatever you want,
so once the information is in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really easy to produce formatted
lists of all or some of those references.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another nice little part of the
workings of the tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a limited basis, we could just
start with what we already have on our
[SPEAKER_01]: garden-based learning site, and change
that from a list to this actual format,
[SPEAKER_01]: as they did on the other websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, I mean, and again, I think what
I would encourage you to do, and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you guys do this if you want to,
is take some of the, I mean, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: one, the thing that would be the,
take the most time, and it really wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be that much time, and it's certainly not
particularly hard, is to take the,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me go back to your, so if I go back
here, and if I am, if you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: together these lists of evidence,
and I'm assuming down, to some where do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have like a bibliography of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right, so I mean, the other
thing too is you can, okay, so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: create, these could all be, yeah,
if you're putting these up anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you wanted to make, you know,
they look like they're basically very well
[SPEAKER_00]: annotated citations, you could recreate
that pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing to first do would be to say,
you know, you need to get this article
[SPEAKER_00]: from Ratcliffe from the Health Promotion
Practice Journal on here, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how, this would be the only thing
that would take a little bit of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you would probably need to go,
you could probably just do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the citation in Google Scholar,
and I would just grab it, and bring it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you might need to go a piece at a
time, and recreate your, so that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that might take a little bit of
time, but how big is your library right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I'm having, you know, like 50 to 100?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think it's that big,
but what I think is happening is some
[SPEAKER_01]: educators might be, you know, creating
their own little pile of references,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're not, we don't have an effective
tool to share, and so if we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: tool, like go, if you're doing something
already, you know, share it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Jen has done a lot of research
related to her pollinator project,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, we don't have it in one
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, looks like Jim does too,
he's got a lot in there too, I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to look, oh, look at all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, it's like, it's really easy
to add, it's like, then you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my gosh, and there's no, unlike like
your front hall closet, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: shortage, it's like, was there too many
shoes in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, nope, you just,
you don't run out of room, you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: putting stuff in there, which can be a
curse as well as a blessing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, and the other thing too,
is if you've done all that really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like you've done great work with
these annotations, so you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could pretty easily copy these,
so in addition to the like, the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: citation information that you would import
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could add your own field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could add, you could add, exactly,
you could go into Zotero, and put,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me cancel this, you could put in your
own, so here, here actually is the
[SPEAKER_00]: article, let me get this a little more,
okay, so here's the article, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's the citation over here,
and then you could put it in, like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: abstract field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just copy and paste it in there,
this would be a really good project for
[SPEAKER_00]: like an intern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would just use a style on
your website, that would have,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would include the abstract in your,
it would kind of be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't flow as a narrative like this
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that would be the one thing,
obviously, is, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this has a nice narrative flow to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be more like citation abstract,
citation abstract, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people can live with that, I suppose,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you guys want to, you know,
talk among yourselves and see if that
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to work, you know, send me an
email, I'm around, and I'm happy to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, help you get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly hard, there's a
little bit of things to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know everybody's really pressed for
time, but I think if you're putting these
[SPEAKER_00]: things together anyway, especially if you
have this feeling that there might be
[SPEAKER_00]: other people out there who are also
collecting this information, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: just add them, if you wanted to,
if you trusted them, you could add them as
[SPEAKER_00]: editors to the library, and then they
could add to it, or they could just send
[SPEAKER_00]: you what they have and you could add it as
well, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are kind of experimenting with
something along those lines already in a
[SPEAKER_02]: small scale to see if that would work,
because we are all working on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and it's crazy to keep reinventing
the wheel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that initially there would be
that big time output, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: outlay, but then in time it would become
more and more efficient, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd see that on the back end when those
resources are all gathered for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other nice thing, too,
is if you're putting this all,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all these lists of references in
essentially a database, so if your website
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, you, again, you're just pointing
to this online site that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change, so you could just link to it,
and yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was really helpful to get us
organized on that level, and basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're always eager to find ways
to make it easy for people to explain why
[SPEAKER_01]: we are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ongoing, right, you guys know
you're important, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we have,
which I think is kind of, it is essential
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a credibility checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back, and I'll just,
I'll show it to you quickly, and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I'm showing you now is,
you know, it's open, it's an open
[SPEAKER_00]: resource, so you could either modify it
and adapt it to your own use or just point
[SPEAKER_00]: people to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a section on evaluating
credibility, which, you know, we teach
[SPEAKER_00]: this to undergraduates, and it actually,
it seems a little simplistic, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing how if you just tell people,
okay, so you pulled up a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you identify the author of this
particular article, and what is his or her
[SPEAKER_00]: credentials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by asking them to ask themselves that
question, you realize most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't even ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even say, well, it's like,
oh, well, it's a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, who wrote this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't find an author,
that's probably a red flag, and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go through, and the authority,
the currency, the purpose, the bias,
[SPEAKER_00]: the accuracy of details, and you can,
this is kind of a really kind of a mini
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you could, you could put this
together in a little tip sheet and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you find a reference on the web,
just do this five-part checklist and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to go into more detail,
UC Berkeley, let me see, I haven't looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at this in a while, see if the link still
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, their library goes through this in
like, extensive detail, so this is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the full, the full-on way to, and this is
usually for evaluating credibility for
[SPEAKER_00]: web-based resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not really so much for you
found, you were searching in a database
[SPEAKER_00]: and you found a scholarly article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like you Googled the topic and
you came across this, and it's just a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you sort of keep it in the back of your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what's the authority,
what's the purpose, what, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: when was this published?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a list of references there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a date it was last updated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's little things there that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that helps, but that's
there, and you can feel free to borrow as
[SPEAKER_00]: much or as little of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to create a little tip
sheet for the public on this and you
[SPEAKER_00]: included, here are five questions to ask
in terms of credibility, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: could add the tip that, and I think some
people know this, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, which is that there is,
there's an advanced Google search where if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go into this, you can actually,
so it allows you to string your search
[SPEAKER_00]: together a little bit better, which is
helpful, but the other thing too is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, you can actually go, and search by
specific domains, so for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were looking for compost,
if I looked for compost and just did a
[SPEAKER_00]: Google search, I'm probably gonna get
mostly sites that wanna sell me compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, but one of the
things you can do, if I limited that to,
[SPEAKER_00]: just as an example, if I limited compost
.edu, you're mostly gonna get,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, I'm getting either EPA or
Cornell Cooperative Extension sites that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the University of Missouri,
so if I limited my search to an edu,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna filter out immediately the
commercial sites that are selling compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could also, you don't even have to
send them to the advanced search,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could just say, put in your search,
and at the end, do site colon dot edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people get into the habit of,
just instead of throwing the net out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lake and pulling back whatever they
find, is like, oh, why don't you throw out
[SPEAKER_00]: the net that will only bring back dot org
stuff, or only edu stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: With visual resources, how to use those
resources in a way that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes you safe and legal,
in terms of fair use, and those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would, and I can, this is actually
a subsection of a guide, oh, here's,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, actually, I think this is actually
quite useful, this is the one I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of, images, a guide to finding
visual resources, so this is fully
[SPEAKER_00]: available, public, anybody can get access
to this, and it includes a section on
[SPEAKER_00]: copyright, what is fair use, the other
thing you can do in terms of, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: staff member, if you're actually a,
if you're Cornell affiliated, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also, if you have specific questions,
so this kind of gives you the guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can walk through this,
and it'll answer most of your questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you had maybe a more specific
question, and wanted some guidance,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is actually a, there's a visual
resources working group within the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, library that will answer,
that would be happy to work with any
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative extension staff members.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those image databases we could freely use
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, I mean, they're going to
tell you, some of these are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription databases, and some of them
are going to be freely available
[SPEAKER_00]: databases.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's subscription, does Cornell have
the subscription?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and so an educator could get access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and so anything here, Cornell
specific or not, like Art Store is a
[SPEAKER_00]: database that you need to be affiliated
with Cornell to get access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have this whole section on open
web, which these are all freely available,
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody can get access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you or anybody else has any questions,
and then specifically about setting up the
[SPEAKER_00]: Zotero database, when you, if you think
you guys want to do that, I'm happy to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
