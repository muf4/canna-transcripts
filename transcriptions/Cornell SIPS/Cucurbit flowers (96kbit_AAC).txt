[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell University
and today I'm here with Steve Reyners.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a horticulture specialist and today
we're going to be talking about flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: on cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve, sometimes people wonder if there
are like females in male plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to plant in order to get
pollenization and to get fruit or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes people don't get fruit in their
plants so can you talk us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about that and how does the flowering
influence the fruit producing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, in cucurbits they're different than
a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, tomatoes have what we call
perfect flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers have both male and female parts
within a single flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cucurbits, and we're talking squash and
pumpkins and cucumbers and melons,
[SPEAKER_01]: with those they have male and female
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a perfect example of it right here
in this plant, right next to each other
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here this is going to be a male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy to tell because if you look at the
base of the flower, there's no immature
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit on that as compared to this right
next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here's a flower and then you
can see this immature fruit and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: notice the difference between these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got male flowers, we got the
female flowers, and here's another female
[SPEAKER_01]: flower here that's even a little bit
further along and that flower is just
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the male flowers, typically there's
going to be maybe 10 or 12 in a season for
[SPEAKER_01]: every single female flower that we're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the male flower, and I'm going to just
pull this one off, I'm going to open it up
[SPEAKER_01]: because there could be a pollinator in
there, sometimes there are, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: not in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is where the pollen is and
bees and other pollinators will go into
[SPEAKER_01]: that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to, actually they're going
for some nectar that's at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: that flower, but they're also getting some
of the pollen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they're in there, they get that
pollen all over themselves and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: go to a female flower like what we'll have
here and you can see here and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing the pollen onto the sticky part,
the stigma of the female flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what's right up there at top,
and moving that pollen over that gives us
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, for some reason, we don't have bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there could be bees, but maybe it's
been a week of rainy weather or it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the bees moving from the
male flowers to the female flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can happen is eventually this will
start to get a little bit bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because you didn't have any pollen
move, you didn't have fruit scent,
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually this will yellow and just fall
right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people sometimes will panic when they
see these and they see these open and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't see any fruit and that's
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing these opening up and
these are falling off and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look for that immature fruit,
then you could potentially have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do all plants then have female or male
flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: All cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cucurbits for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be exceptions because some
are, we'll have only female flowers and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to put some other plants out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollinators is what we call them because
they'll have male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just had a feeling of nothing but
female flowers, we wouldn't really get
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
