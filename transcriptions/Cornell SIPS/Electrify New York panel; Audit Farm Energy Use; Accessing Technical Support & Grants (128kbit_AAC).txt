[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Gabriel Gurley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the program manager for Ag Energy New
York program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a statewide program working with
cooperative extension offices throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the state, but our offices are located in
the Tompkins County Cooperative Extension
[SPEAKER_00]: Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spend a few minutes
talking to you today about audit farming
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy use, talk a little bit about
the auditing process, energy auditing
[SPEAKER_00]: process for farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you a little bit of
description about that and also talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the technical supports and grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to first begin talking a
little bit about the energy auditing
[SPEAKER_00]: process, what it is, what it entails,
what kind of benefits someone can receive
[SPEAKER_00]: from an energy audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, I'm going to spend a little
bit of time talking about different energy
[SPEAKER_00]: grants, financing programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wide array of programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for me to cover it all in
this presentation today, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the ones that I'm going to present
today is related to agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably touch a little bit about
residential, but again, mostly because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the program I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spend my time and focus on
those that particularly address
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm going to kind of tie
it all in and kind of point out some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that at AgEnergy New York,
we can assist with in these endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is an energy audit and
what are their benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: An energy audit, sometimes it's also
referred to as an energy assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just a detailed examination
of a building's energy use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of agricultural production,
it can entail the entire agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production process on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buildings, for example, it may be a
poultry building or some sort of livestock
[SPEAKER_00]: building, a barn, that the energy audit
process will go through and evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be other things specifically
on the farm, specific pieces of equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in value added production,
for example, it could entail
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigeration, cooling, ventilation for
livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much it covers everything across
the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talk about buildings, oftentimes
folks think about an energy assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to the residential home,
which those are available as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to agricultural
production, it covers the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production that's on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose of an energy audit is to
identify energy saving opportunities and
[SPEAKER_00]: improving performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's both within the buildings and
for the agricultural production operations
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's included in an energy audit?
[SPEAKER_00]: An energy audit or assessment of how a
building or entire production operation
[SPEAKER_00]: uses energy, where it is being wasted and
any safety or health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes when you get the report,
it's a very detailed report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks everything down on the
operation, factoring in where the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: is being used, where it's being wasted,
safety or health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes in that energy audit,
it'll also have what they have called an
[SPEAKER_00]: executive summary page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you the highlights of
what the entire report is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like an engineering report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The report can be multiple dozen pages
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really does cover everything from A
to Z in terms of the farm operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the case of residential,
the homeowner as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those list of recommendations,
recommended energy efficiency measures and
[SPEAKER_00]: associated energy savings potentials are
listed in that report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll break down equipment by equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an energy auditor comes out and
performs an energy auditor assessment on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm, they will actually go through
every piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pull the information off the name
plates, off the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They detail that, they put it in a report
and they have the ability to measure and
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate based upon the piece of
equipment, what potential energy uses it's
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if there could be based upon the
production measures that the farm is
[SPEAKER_00]: using, they could give recommendations on
where some associated energy savings can
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about the energy audit
or energy assessment as well, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: with farm production, is that they don't
give recommendations just to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, you can go now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get zero by doing this,
this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the energy auditor comes out onto the
farm, they have a conversation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer themselves and they will listen to
the farmer and try to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: their goals and objectives are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they make a recommendation on the
report, they try to make sure that those
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations is something that the
farmer can actually implement,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is within the goals of what
the farm is trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly don't make
recommendations that's gonna make the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer's life harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they don't come out and make
recommendations just to say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do this, you can reduce the amount of
energy used by such and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they know that it's gonna create more
issues in the production process for the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, then they're probably not gonna
follow through with the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really try to take a realistic
approach when the energy audits are
[SPEAKER_00]: performed and what they put in the report
in terms of those energy saving measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is an energy audit useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two items here, but there's
multiple reasons why energy audit is
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, before making any energy saving
improvements, or adding a renewable energy
[SPEAKER_00]: system, it's important to have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also having a plan for equipment
replacements, they increase the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency when a component fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the benefits about an energy
assessment is oftentimes it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody requests one because they want to
see what they can do to save energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's what the energy
assessment report will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say it's something on a major
piece of equipment, the equipment hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: failed yet, it was gonna be a major
investment for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the farmer says, I can't do it
right now, but it's something I should
[SPEAKER_00]: look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, any piece of equipment sooner or
later is going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the farmer has had an energy assessment
or audit performed, when that piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment fails, the first thing they can
do is go grab that report and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, I can remember that the energy
auditor told me something about replacing
[SPEAKER_00]: this with another piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a roadmap to go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not just going out and making
impulse decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go by that recommendation,
replace it with a newer piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like having a roadmap or a
plan in place in case something were to
[SPEAKER_00]: change or this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: A piece of equipment were to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes an energy audit is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a farmer, for example, is either
purchasing a new farm or looking at making
[SPEAKER_00]: some production changes, sometimes the
lender may require an energy assessment to
[SPEAKER_00]: be performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes the farmer will call out and
request an energy assessment for those
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy audits can help you understand how
much energy your residence or agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: operation uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prioritizes problem areas and fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps make your residence or
agricultural production areas more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient and comfortable for the workers,
livestock, and you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just necessarily about trying
to save the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it could help make the operation
more efficient and more comfortable for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone that's on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to use your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that energy audit, sometimes
folks don't even realize that some pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: of equipment is consuming that much
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you learn a lot about the equipment and
what may be using energy on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine where the energy is being
wasted, to make personalized
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations and to help lower your
energy bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you apply for an energy audit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in New York, it's extremely simple to
get an energy audit performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy audits are available at no
charge to customers of an investor-owned
[SPEAKER_00]: utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is NICEG, National
Grid, any of your major utility companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're considered to be investor-owned
utilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way to determine that is
when a farmer opens up their utility bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look on their bill and they see a
systems benefit charge posted there on
[SPEAKER_00]: their monthly utility bill, that indicates
they're eligible for the energy audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who is looking for an energy audit
for a residence, best way to do is reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out to your regional clean energy hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also contact participating local
service providers for those energy audits
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of HVAC companies and those sorts of
folks can come out and provide an energy
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For agricultural operations, it's very
simple as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go through NYSERDA's energy audit
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you can go to NYSERDA's
website and look up their agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link posted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find it there, then,
of course, go to the Ag Energy New York
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the links posted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a contact us button at the
top where you can click and post a message
[SPEAKER_00]: to myself and Guillermo in the office,
and we can get you relayed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate person for an energy audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the application itself, there's an
online application that can fill out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and John, you've helped walk through some
folks as well when they called into the
[SPEAKER_00]: office through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an online application,
folks who are maybe a little intimidated
[SPEAKER_00]: on filling out applications online.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where John has helped folks out
before through Ag Energy New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper application, it's literally one
page front and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all they have to do is fill out
their name, a telephone number,
[SPEAKER_00]: email address, what type of commodities
they produce on the farm, and sign on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about as simple as anything that
you can apply for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these audits are available at no
charge to the customers, and these audits
[SPEAKER_00]: are also available every two to three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get an energy audit performed,
it's not one of those things where you
[SPEAKER_00]: just get report, you set it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your production changes on the farm,
maybe you're entering into some new crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe growing some different types or
raising some different types of livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're getting into a value added
production on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any time there's changes happening to
your farm, you can request to have another
[SPEAKER_00]: free energy audit performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that covers a little bit about the
energy audit process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to touch a little bit here on
the various grants and financial programs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cover three major areas,
the USDA REAP program, utility specific
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, and I'm highlighting National
Grid just as an example because they cover
[SPEAKER_00]: such a large area of the state,
but the other utilities throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: state offer various programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're in NYSEG or RG&E
service area, they have programs available
[SPEAKER_00]: for agricultural producers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll touch on a few other
resources as well, NRCS programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA, and the NYSERDA REAP technical
assistance program.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you don't see on
here is that they're state programs that
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State offers at the state level
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of time, we couldn't go
into all of those, but they have specific
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that may tie into some of these
programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions that's always
asked is, well, can I apply for a REAP
[SPEAKER_00]: grant and apply for a state grant program
with financing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is, in many cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stack incentives and grants on top
of one another to help reduce those costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the barriers cost to adopting energy
efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first up is the REAP program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The REAP program, it's an acronym for
Rural Energy for America program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first created back in 2008 by
Congress in the Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And REAP helps support farmers,
ranchers, and rural communities adopt
[SPEAKER_00]: energy efficiency measures and also
utilize renewable energy sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objectives for REAP, REAP
facilitates its mission through two
[SPEAKER_00]: primary objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's a grant or loan guaranteed to
agricultural producers and rural
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses for energy efficiency
improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purchase of renewable energy
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also provides grants to service
providers to assist farmers in getting
[SPEAKER_00]: energy audits and planning and development
of utilizing renewable energy sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: To qualify for a REAP grant, agricultural
producers must receive at least 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: their gross income from their agricultural
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: REAP qualified energy efficiency
improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers a wide range of areas that REAP
funding can be used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a few bullet points on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the things that you could
typically think of in terms of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency improvements, it will cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high efficiency heating, ventilation,
air conditioning systems, insulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, cooling and refrigeration units,
energy efficient equipment and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: REAP loan guarantee details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loans guarantee are available up to 75% of
total eligible costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a grant, the amount is up to 50% of
total eligible project costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: REAP also combines grant and loan
guarantee funding up to 75% of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: eligible costs based upon the eligibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loan amounts and terms are based upon the
use of the funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically the funds, loan terms can go
all the way up to 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of links there for the USDA REAP
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also visit Ag Energy New York
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utility specific programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just going to hit some of the
highlights for national grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an agriculture program rebate
that's available to non-residential
[SPEAKER_00]: customers for energy efficiency upgrades
to facilities and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of rebates, prescriptive
rebates and custom rebates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prescriptive means they already have a
list of what rebates they could provide on
[SPEAKER_00]: a fixed amount basis, pre-described custom
rebates means they can go in and evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: the project and base a custom rebate based
upon an analysis and specific
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prescriptive rebates include lighting,
HVAC, process systems, commercial kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, refrigeration, of course
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Programs open to all non-residential
utility customers, but that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the residential program that
gives you a monthly discount on the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Programs administered on an annual basis
beginning September 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must apply by January, July 1st,
excuse me, to be eligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all national grid agricultural
customers are eligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of time, just there's the
agricultural productivity program as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a few details there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the capital investments are,
what the total funding is available to
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of prescriptions they
provide for that particular program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, feel free to
reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the AgEnergy New York website and
click contact us button.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other incentive programs just very
quickly, NRCS on farm energy initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: House programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those listed on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA farm storage facility loan program
provides low interest loans that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: in energy efficiencies and storage
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our NYSERDA REIT technical assistance
program provides free assistance for those
[SPEAKER_00]: that are maybe applying for a REIT grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that assistance available throughout
New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate it everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, anyone that has any questions can
always visit our website at AgEnergy New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and feel free to reach out to us if
you have any questions or needing
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
