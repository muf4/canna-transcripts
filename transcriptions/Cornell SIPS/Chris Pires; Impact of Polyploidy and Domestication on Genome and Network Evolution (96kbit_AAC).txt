[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for the introduction,
Margaret and Gaurav and other people who
[SPEAKER_00]: invited me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me in the back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry Davis was reminding me earlier,
the last time I was here and in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: was 2005, and I lost my voice and I
whispered my way through the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, hopefully that won't happen
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since 2005, I've been at the University
of Missouri, and it took me probably 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years to figure out how to talk to people
about my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to tell people I worked on
heterosis and hybrid vigor and chimeras
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally learned if I really wanted
to talk to people out in the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the best thing I could do is say I
worked on the dogs of the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I could tell them that,
you know, you know a Chihuahua and a Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Dane are a dog, but did you know that
broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussels
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouts are one species like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can spend the rest of the time
talking about their dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just a nice professor talking
about dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's first knowledge bomb of the day
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I get on an airplane and I don't
want to talk to people, I just tell people
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an evolutionary biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pretty much stops the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I put on my headphones and start
reviewing manuscripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I am thinking about evolution,
I really start with Ono, 1970 and before
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Ono postulated that gene
duplication played a major role in
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the era of genomics,
I think the big update to this is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to tell you is the thesis of my
talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that all duplications aren't
alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you spend a lot of time like I do
working with computer scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really have to get them to recognize
the difference between tandem duplicates
[SPEAKER_00]: and polyploid duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they behave differently and they
operate differently in terms of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to do this lesson
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing which is going to be the
theme of my talk is these whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: duplications occur throughout most of life
taxonomically and also over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to talk today about both
recent and ancient polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we no longer rely on
reference genomes, but use pan genomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand variation, this structural
variation is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing GWAS, you can't just do
it on SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to include structural variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to understand the genotype
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not for plants and crops,
but also for human diseases and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this crowd doesn't need to know about
what is polyploidy, because you guys all
[SPEAKER_00]: know what polyploidy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to make the distinction
between auto and allopolyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your historical cytogenesis is like
a stamped helicoin, you defined auto and
[SPEAKER_00]: allo based on chromosome pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I'm going to talk about it today
in terms of ancestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to talk about
specifically today is allopolyploidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have the merger of two distinct
species that come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way to state this is I really
like chimeric links.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll even say grafting for Margaret's
sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing two things together that
normally don't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you get novelty from the
combinations of these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say the major advance since I
started grad school in 1994 and finished
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2000 was knowing that from cytogenetic
evidence, things like corn were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: palaeopolypoids compared to sorghum based
on even basic observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest surprise, hands down,
from the rabidopsis genome paper wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that were promised when
they started the rabidopsis genome
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this figure and the other analyses
that showed that this tiny little genome
[SPEAKER_00]: with five chromosomes had not one,
not two, but three polyploid events,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were named alpha, beta, and gamma
from the most recent to the ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, people speculated that
alpha was about the base of the mustard
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta was at the base of the eudicots and
gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the base of all angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of those assertions were
wrong, which became the basis of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we sequenced Grape and Ambril and
other things, at least when I started as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grad student, we would say things like,
oh, 70% of firing plants are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was based on the idea of
thinking about what a neopolypoid is and
[SPEAKER_00]: stonemates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you now look deep in time about how
you define polyploidy, we now know that
[SPEAKER_00]: all firing plants, extent firing plants,
including Ambrella, have an ancestor that
[SPEAKER_00]: was polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really shouldn't ask ourselves,
are you polyploid?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should really say, when was the last
time you were polyploid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so us who are vertebrates,
well, the last time we were polyploid was
[SPEAKER_00]: about 350 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like Ethan McSlight had made a
career studying how those polyploid
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicates left from the origin of
polyploidy from vertebrates are now part
[SPEAKER_00]: of our disease network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's a whole groups of
invertebrates that are polyploid,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the most specious groups of
vertebrates like fish and frogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in one of the four groups of
the school that works with crop plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you care about domestication, you should
also know by now that crop plants are,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the wild plants, more likely
to be polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question is, how do genomes and all
the other omics and networks evolve in
[SPEAKER_00]: brassicas or any crop based on this
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very important plants I'm going to
talk about today are brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dogs in the plant world,
I call it oleracea, cabbage, broccoli,
[SPEAKER_00]: cauliflower, so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica rapa, maybe you don't know,
is also a dog or cat, because it has all
[SPEAKER_00]: these amazing Chinese vegetables and
things like turnip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brassica napis is also pretty diverse,
has underground things like rutabagas or
[SPEAKER_00]: swedes, leafy things like Siberian kales,
and then a whole suite of oilseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the real big picture of what my
lab's been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab, along with, I would say,
Doug and Pam Soltis' lab and maybe Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Doyle's lab, a few others, have been
looking at polyploid, not from recent
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but also at the base of the
families and all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of the flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm showing here is brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you imagine, let's start on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that in the mustard family,
you had an eight chromosome ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over evolutionary time, Arabidopsis became
duplidized to five chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometime around 15 million years
ago, there was a hexaplastic polyploidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: so two rounds of polyploidy, hexaploid
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went from eight to 24 chromosomes
in the brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those duplidized down to nine
chromosomes in Oloracea, 10 chromosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: rapa, two to four million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those merged together to make
brassica napis and ala polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is neopolyploidy, brassica
napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesopolyploidy, this kind of where you can
see chromosome segments and blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're acting like diploids, but you can
still see these blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then paleopolyploidy, the alpha,
beta, gamma event, and Arabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just have duplicate genes left,
but no synteny really among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give my talk today talking
about these three polyploid eras,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, going from oldest to most
recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, if you add up all the
polyploid events together from the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering plants, Arabidopsis is 12x,
the diploid brassica is a 36x,
[SPEAKER_00]: and brassica napis is 72x.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we published that genome in
Science in 2014, it was the most polyploid
[SPEAKER_00]: genome at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, those are the four parts of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so yesterday, the day before,
is Fei Wei here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fei Wei and I and 200 other people
have, over the last decade, have thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: together 1,000 some-odd transcriptomes
under the leadership of, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly Jim Levins Mack and some other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent a lot of time on this
project, kind of like the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome Project, to make a big tree,
a big nuclear gene tree of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to contrast to the mostly
chloroplast organelle tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also wanted to look at genes and
gene family expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was the big result?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the Arabidopsis genome result
with its three polyploid events.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big result of this paper has nothing
to do with the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 244 ancient WGDs hold genome duplications
across green plants, 65 that match
[SPEAKER_00]: published genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every land plant lineage has an ancient
polyploid event, except for some weird
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, liberal works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by contrast, almost none of the things
in the water, algal lineages, have
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, in my mind, is the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you don't have to read the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I want to read you the last two
sentences, three sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene and genome duplications have been
considered a source of evolutionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the direct connections between
key innovations and specific gene
[SPEAKER_00]: duplications are rarely known due in part
to lag times between duplications and such
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier today I met with Galrov.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, I say we, he is going
to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the second the genes and
everything else duplicate, enzymes don't
[SPEAKER_00]: change right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes some time to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look on a tree where polyploid
events occur, there's always a lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a lag between when they
actually get novelty and when they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually speciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we'll be talking about this in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what do they say next in this
paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do more experiments on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, the way that you do these
experiments, not just in one system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but across the clay that has polyploidy,
be it grasses, andropogony, or rascaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so starting with the oldest polyploid
events, this part of this project was
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated by what's the origin of
mustards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know when you eat wasabi or mustard
or radish, maybe spicy things,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have those flavors and tastes
because they're good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping away critters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they keep away a lot of critters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other critters, like these
butterflies, will learn how to eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillar shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant goes, help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here comes some little wasps or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these tritrophic interactions,
and there's microbes involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this really cool evolutionary
relationship, which this relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: alone is how Ehrlich and Raven coined the
term co-evolution, was thinking about this
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because I told you earlier about alpha,
beta, gamma, people didn't know where this
[SPEAKER_00]: beta, gamma event were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that the one was at the
origin of eudicots, another one beta
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a meeting in China, and Mike
Fling was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said something you probably should
have known, which was, oh, Andy Patterson,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking at phyagina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Pat Edger, a grad student in my
time, who is now a professor at Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: State, said, we're going to find beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how this project started,
was we're going to find beta, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to see an alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two ancient polychoid events in
Rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see how they affect
glucocyanin network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Pat defended his PhD in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to publish the paper just on
the plant side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, Chris Wheat was driving
across Missouri to go to Kansas to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the lepidoptera butterfly part of
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lined up these trees, and it was
too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to publish this paper together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this is the only time in my life
where I said, oh, 50 anniversary of Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven and Paul Erick's paper, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be a Nature paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no Nature paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no science paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we finally published in PNAS,
and it's been our biggest by far thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NPR, Washington Post, Radio New
Zealand, Daily Mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was still not too happy about the
Nature Science thing until it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening joke of a Big Bang Theory episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, screw you, Science and
Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a jumping joke on a Big Bang Theory
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need your stupid journals anyway,
and I'm not even going to try to submit
[SPEAKER_00]: there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I will tell a
brief version of the story because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: told it a million times before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants evolve a novel biochemical defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants re-deate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects evolve a counter adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool part of this story, the
butterflies don't have polyploidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have a tandem gene duplicate that
gives them basically the countermeasure to
[SPEAKER_00]: the mustard oil bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the butterflies diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the butterflies, of course,
are cued into what is necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the big result of this is shown in
this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we did was we made the
first nuclear gene-based phylogeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: the brassicales, before it was unresolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could actually do what hadn't been
done before, which is map all the
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolates on a tree to infer the
order that they evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing was we showed where the
polyploid events were based on
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomes and shallow genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the blue diamond for beta,
and that blue diamond for alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we showed where those polyploid events
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third thing was we compared where the
polyploid events were relative to species
[SPEAKER_00]: radiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are where the stars are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brassicae and those top ones in
green, the three big speciose families,
[SPEAKER_00]: are totally different than all those other
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking plant systematics,
you probably don't learn
[SPEAKER_00]: penta-deplandraceae in plant systematics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most places, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the other thing was the innovation
of the glucosinolate classes that
[SPEAKER_00]: correspond to these polyploid events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's where the radiations occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we identified that there's these
novel pathways, and similar work has been
[SPEAKER_00]: done in the Solanaceae by Rob Last and
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since then, this work has continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been updating the phylogenomic
framework for brassicales, thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly about glucosinolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just posted on BioArchive a paper
that works further into other polyploid
[SPEAKER_00]: events, such as within the Cleomeaceae and
some of these other families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have this really large three CSPs
with JGI to look at not just the genomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the transcriptome of metabolic
profiling across members of this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have massive convergent
evolution of various metabolic pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploid events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 19, 20 new genomes to add to ones
that are already out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this huge team, including Jacob
Washington, Ashburn in this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others who've helped with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these recent projects are,
we're going to go deep into the brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: oleraceae, crambie hispanica, phalaspi
arvinaceae, which you may know as
[SPEAKER_00]: pennycress, camelina, and arabidopsis to
do platinum genomes for about 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions, and to do a whole bunch of
tissue-specific profiling of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomes and metabolomes to see how
those change those networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jen Weiss-Caber, and Pat Edger,
and Dan Klevenstein, and I are leading
[SPEAKER_00]: that effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's ancient polyploidy in a
nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So old duplicates really matter for big
novel key innovations that can result in
[SPEAKER_00]: classic and clay-defining features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about these polyploid events,
which you can't see under a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you paint a genome, you would see
like, oh, for every back-sized piece in
[SPEAKER_00]: arabidopsis, I see three of those in
brassica oleraceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's a simple slide showing the
diversity of brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have things like turnip, which you're
probably familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in any Asian market or farmers
market that has Chinese vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have Chinese cabbage and bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have sarsens, or oil seeds,
which come in yellow and brown colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some other field mustards,
and you have this interesting thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a rapini.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started this study,
and this was a collaboration with Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: Gore and Joanne Labatt that started with
for some GBS sequencing of the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: collection, what do we know about brassica
rapa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were two studies that were
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was in 2011 about how they're
basically some morphological groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study in 2014 which said
actually there's geographic groups because
[SPEAKER_00]: things like turnips are found in Asia and
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so turnip-like things are more closely
related to things that look different than
[SPEAKER_00]: they do together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then while we're in the middle of our
study, there was a large paper by Ching
[SPEAKER_00]: and Alan, both rapa and oleraceae,
which gave out this tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, the groups are what we
found, but it's pretty comb-like in how
[SPEAKER_00]: things are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanted to ask was could we tell
were things domesticated multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: were they moved by people, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the real question that was
burning for me and also for some other
[SPEAKER_00]: students was what about these leafy
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they wild, are they domesticated,
or are they feral?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this first study, we had a lot
of accessions, 333, and we found these
[SPEAKER_00]: major groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found bok choy is a group on the
top, Chinese cabbage, and they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: formed by hybrids, which some people had
hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found Asian turnips and various other
Asian vegetables in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sarsens formed one cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellow and brown sarsen are really just
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different by a gene or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found these turnips at the
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some groups that are named
taxonomically like field mustard or
[SPEAKER_00]: polypolytic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem with this study,
so we're the first ones to show this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the problem in this study is we didn't
see a sample rapini and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: types, and also there weren't really any
wild samples that were put in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in a follow-up study, this was a
collaboration with Mike Barker and Gavin
[SPEAKER_00]: Conant and I on the Planned Genome Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the diversity of brassica
rapid using transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our lab is one of the labs,
along with Claude de Pamphlis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Lehmans-Mack, and others who really
got off to an early start using
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomes, both for biogenetics and
population genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was looking at 126 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We again found these same groups as I
talked about before, but we did answer one
[SPEAKER_00]: question, which was the rapinis here were
clearly fully nested next to these
[SPEAKER_00]: sarsens, so they're not at the base of the
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like a big result from this
paper in terms of how the topology of
[SPEAKER_00]: these groups looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't sample Asian turnips and a
bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we did in this paper
was this was the first time that a
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic model like daddy had been
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people who worked on those in
humans helped us work on these in these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two post-docs working on this
project, Xin Shui Chi and Mike Barker's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and Hong An and my lab, both were into
reading about where cabbages and things
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the Chinese literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're able to track that,
oh, where we saw the origin of turnip was
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cuneiform tablets had them on in
Babylon in Iraq, and where they were in
[SPEAKER_00]: classic poetry in China 26 years,
100 years ago, or 1,300 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 960 years ago, pretty much matched in a
very rough sense when these demographic
[SPEAKER_00]: models put the spread of brassica wrap up
mostly from east to west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out, of course, that that
follows the Silk Road pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of admixture back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in contrast, there was a bottleneck at
the origin of the sarsens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened about the same time as
when Alexander the Great went into that
[SPEAKER_00]: part of India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sounds like it's a very nice and
neat story, except for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Alex McAlvey.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a grad student of Eve Inschwillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Jeff, is that one of your
students, Eve?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Jeff Doyle's academic grandson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now a postdoc here with Sunny Powers,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been collecting a ton of these
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, that's a really simple story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually 13 different subspecies
of brassica wrapa that you folks are
[SPEAKER_00]: missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these feral things all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, his hypothesis is that
brassica wrapa originated probably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caucasus and spread east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, there's a lot more to do
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a done story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the network idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this kind of population genetic
framework of how brassica wrapa has
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved, what about these duplicate genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Mike Barker and the consortium of
us have a manuscript that we're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're looking at targets of
selection with a particular comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between duplicates that come by tandem
versus polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at the paleologs for these,
we ask this question, do paleologs have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher genetic diversity than other genes
of brassica wrapa?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to this is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a four-fold higher diversity of
these paleologs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, what I really like to do is take
these list of paleologs and look at them
[SPEAKER_00]: not just in brassica wrapa, but also in
brassica oleraceae, like kales,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in arugula, or other plants that are
related to this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to ask people not just what
their five-year plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could summarize your research
into one question, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a one-word answer,
but I have this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, I'm really interested in
how networks evolve over time and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when you're a chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine any network on the left
side, after a whole genome duplication,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have this plethora of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, you have mostly gene loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can have novelty by having new
topologies of relationships, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated by that arrow in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thought partners in this over the
years have been Jim Burchler, Gavin
[SPEAKER_00]: Conant, Mike Freling, and others to think
about, well, if you wanted to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: human medicine, wouldn't it be cool if you
had a polypoid human?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to understand a plant,
wouldn't it be cool if you had a polypoid
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, we have polypoid plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you double the system,
can you really look at the constraints of
[SPEAKER_00]: network evolution and what the
consequences are for phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, synthetic biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Gavin and Jim and I wrote a paper
in 2014 on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacob Washburn and Kevin Bird and Gavin
and I wrote a paper in 2016 on convergence
[SPEAKER_00]: and multiplies is about convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published a paper in 2018 on
biogenomics and network evolution that we
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of time on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gal Rob and I and a group of us
published a paper recently on thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this in terms of metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want our philosophical thoughts,
there they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so back to experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an unpublished experiment on
Brassica rapa, Arabidopsis and Kleome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would have published it a long time
ago, except the Brassica rapa genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: we used for it is still sitting
unpublished in an unnamed group's
[SPEAKER_00]: basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you the results and then
we'll just repeat it someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the experiment was this, was if you
look at Arabidopsis and Brassica across
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues and across a bunch of different
challenging treatments over circadian time
[SPEAKER_00]: course, what do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using light, dark, flooding,
salt, cold and methyl jasmineate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine in a broad scheme you have
whatever Arabidopsis network that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica is going to have three sub
networks from right, the whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: triplications, hexaploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, one of those subgenomes,
LF, these fractionated still resembles the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestral Arabidopsis genome pretty much,
whereas the other two subgenomes have
[SPEAKER_00]: become highly fractionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the genome of Brassica
rapa, only 7% of it is still in
[SPEAKER_00]: triplicate, 32% of it is in duplicate and
61% of it is single copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at some abiotic
stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a fraction of the duplicates are
expressed in any particular stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's hypoxia, salt, cold or methyl
jasmineate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'll show you is that they're
different duplicates in different
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Arabidopsis, if your entire
interactome is 10,811 nodes, in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis, this abiotic stress node is
about 961.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Brassica, okay, and then in
Arabidopsis, by the way, that stress
[SPEAKER_00]: network, 238 nodes, so 25% of those nodes
go off whenever they get stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brassica, you have many more nodes from
the subgenomes, 537, 289, 239,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 2% of those respond in all
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was explaining this to some
non-scientists so I decided to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arabidopsis is like one radar to detect
things, and if something goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sends a fire truck every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica's got radar, sonar, you know,
everything R, and it sends a fire truck,
[SPEAKER_00]: a helicopter, or a boat, depending on what
kind of stresses happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brassica's, or anything that has these
kind of polypoid networks, have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility in the kind of things that
they can do in either a sub or
[SPEAKER_00]: neo-functionalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functionalized context, let alone a dosage
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so to dive further into this,
since 2013, we've made a pretty exhaustive
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog of concerned non-coding sequences
among the Brassicae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show a couple cartoons
where I have a gene that looks like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's two green exons and a bunch
of little CNSs of these little yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after polyploidy, this is what you
often see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top is an Arabidopsis gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got one, two, three, four,
five, six CNSs, and it's got two,
[SPEAKER_00]: two exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in Brassica, almost none of
them will look totally like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have the one in the least fraction
of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have all the exons and most of the
CNSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two other subgenomes will
either have a loss or have more CNSs lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ed, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CNS loss is consistent with
sub-functionalization following gene
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use polyploidy and
polyploid-aware AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: To think about constraints in these kind
of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever somebody comes and gives a
talk, I got the latest and greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR, high throughput, blah,
blah, blah, and I'm going to do all these
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spend two hours on my
computer and figure out that 90% of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things you want to do are crap,
because evolution has already done the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, when I look at the Pan Am
project or some of these other projects we
[SPEAKER_00]: have going on, we're going to model most
of the space out to know where we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: For doing actual targeted gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have this data for every gene that's
in Arabidopsis that we know enough about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just one cartoon example of
fractionation mutagenesis so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left is an Arabidopsis gene,
and on the right are the three versions of
[SPEAKER_00]: it in Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go look at some cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just crude tissue stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, you can see where we're
going with this simple cell technology
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put this gene under a couple of
time courses in Arabidopsis, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning it goes up, and then in the
evening it goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical gene that's responsive to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, CNS6 is light responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll notice over here what's going on
in the Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has got its CNS thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's going to respond to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure enough, this Brassica homolog of
this responds just like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it doesn't respond to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't do anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, of course it does stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Arabidopsis gene, it's like the
firetrak, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows up all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tissue does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene acts just like Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: All tissues, all the time, always on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, oh, shows up in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows up when there's flooding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the speedboat version,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then there's a whole exhaustive
gene in the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so take home tweetable point number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's tweeting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, one person?
[SPEAKER_00]: F.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tweetable point number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now use these systems to think
about, we used to use terms like new and
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-functionalization to talk about a
single gene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome of a single duplicate gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can think about networks these
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, are you on board?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so in my fantasy experiment,
you have 1,001 perfect genomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis, including tandem and tandem
duplicates and polypoid duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your 1,001 Brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your 1,001 Sorghums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your 1,001 Mazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tie all this together to
really understand constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff, what did you call it today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we have, I mean, maybe the real
question is, why are things different?
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do they stay the same when they
have all these poly levels on top of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and go through meiosis and make poly?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I've been thinking about this a
lot, along with Jen Weisskaber and Gaurav
[SPEAKER_00]: and others, about how could this affect
both primary metabolism, things like CAM
[SPEAKER_00]: and C4, as well as specialized metabolism,
like glucosinolates or cardiac glycosides,
[SPEAKER_00]: or name your favorite metabolic network.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oloracea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're on to the docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this part is completely unpublished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally tweetable because we've
talked about it before, but this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this work is what I'm going to
present to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today has mostly been by my graduate
student, Mackenzie Mabry, on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of, again, a USDA grant with
Mike Gore and Joanne Labatt and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have Sarah Turner on the
right, who's in now Jeff Rossabar's lab at
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you transcriptome
data, but Sarah's got genome data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together, they have all this other
morphology and phenomics and ionomics and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I'm not going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm just going to talk about
wolves and dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this new trend for
de-domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every time people write a review
paper that start with Sacklethman's
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, they put in the review paper this
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, if I don't write the
de-domestication grant for brassica like
[SPEAKER_00]: the next month, I'm a fool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a problem with this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it doesn't show how those different
things are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, that thing in the middle is
fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no wild mustard plant that looks
like an annual herbaceous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Chinese white kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a domesticated thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what the heck is that
that we're going to de-domesticate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look anything like that.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are the wolves and who are the
dogs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all the other things,
by the way, besides the five canonical
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, as I learned yesterday,
favorite part of my trip so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: Margaret and Griff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Griff here?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good god.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, Griff, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and looked at all these
amazing, there's more diversity in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field of kales than I've seen in my whole
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these different kales
and collards and walking sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares about dogs?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are way cooler than dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the progenitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some possible progenitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike brassica rapa, which occurs on
the continent, brassica relatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild relatives in the Sea Genome,
which also have nine chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: are mostly in the coast of the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got these really hard leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they can take salt spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're witty at their base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all the possible contenders
for who could be the extant closest
[SPEAKER_00]: relative, the brassica alacia.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been three competing hypotheses
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're British, you like the
hypothesis that the origin is in Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a surprise?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why would you think that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you go to the coast of UK,
you find things that look like wild
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also on the coast of France and
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the British don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think, OK, well, British,
wild cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like the Babylonian arguments,
which is also false, but if you like the
[SPEAKER_00]: argument, where there's the most number of
species, that should be the origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most number of wild sea relatives
are in southern Italy, particularly Sicily
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sardinia and Corsica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recently, people have done
phylogenetic work not on DNA, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do a phylogenetic analysis of
the words of the species, brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: cratica, which is on Crete, and brassica
hilarionis, which is in Turkey and
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring area, would be the extant
sister species to domesticate brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: aureus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are our current three hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this really nice paper,
Chang et al, came out that shows this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, where you have cabbages,
kales, bus sprouts, kohlrabis as one
[SPEAKER_00]: group, cauliflower, broccoli, is another
group, and then Chinese kale, sister,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of those, but not really a good
analysis of what was sister to it as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the wild things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two questions I want to pose
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, how are the wild relatives related
to each other and to brassica hilarica and
[SPEAKER_00]: where they occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's the wolf?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, how are all these dogs related
to each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only going to talk about,
I'm going to show you kind of pop-chan
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetic trees today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the data that we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done this for rapa, hilarica,
nepis, and some other things like arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow plants in a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in four replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have kind of a semi-high throughput way
called undergrads who harvest these things
[SPEAKER_00]: and do little vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, leaf four is for RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf two, three, and four is leaf scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf two is for metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf three is for ionomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: One undergrad, Brandon Grienstraut really
got into Raspberry Pi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made these like Raspberry Pi
system for looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published a little paper on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a pretty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wonder how you get 150 papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good grad student like McKinsey
mentoring undergrads to publish little
[SPEAKER_00]: papers like this along the way about a
method like Raspberry Pi, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally cool undergrad project.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first PCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Michael has seen this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the first PCA here is on the
right are wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left are all the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who are these guys here that are
the wild ones or the closest to the
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticates?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are brassica crudica and brassica
incana.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at a phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the pretty typical these days
in phylogenomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this tree, it has 100%
bootstraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can run a different program and
also have 100% bootstraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll be a different tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bootstrap values are kind of
meaningless in this era when you have 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: bootstrap for conflicting relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole other conversation to
have about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we find are a monophyletic group
of domesticates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica crudica, sister to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica incana, sister to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some alternative topologies they
flip, or they're both sister to the
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry, my friends in the UK,
but your wild cabbage on the coast is not
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a feral dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a feral dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the domesticated
brassicas, you've got collard greens and
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbages and the kohlrabi cauliflower
broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got lots more to do in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all this other data to use not
just for GWAS and TWAAS, but we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: these glucosinolates and things to work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have morphometrics and leaf scans to
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may also work with Dan Shipwood or
some other folks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the reason why I came
here was to go out yesterday and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the huge diversity set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this amazing GWAS platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so easy to add some of these
other things that some of the students
[SPEAKER_00]: here have been working on for Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be fun to do together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for machine learning,
another thing from phenotypes to enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of things that would be fun
to play with with people here elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last little piece on this is on
feralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to think of polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyploid is the window in the genome
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been thinking about these little
feral dogs as ways to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication because it's like
domestication in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have these woody cabbages off the
coast of UK, France, and Spain,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also off the coast of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was an undergrad at Berkeley in
1986, Herbert Baker would talk about these
[SPEAKER_00]: wild cabbages that are now off the coast
of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've become woody again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a huge project,
just sitting here to look at the parallel
[SPEAKER_00]: de-domestication back to wittiness and
perenniality across these different
[SPEAKER_00]: habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, if you go to the
Canary Islands or Channel Islands off the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK and Europe, you get walking sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are eight foot tall, woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was still money for
Arabidopsis biofuel money, this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing you'd want to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that money is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's too bad.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we use this de-domestication
feralization process to understand crops
[SPEAKER_00]: in a rapidly changing environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time do I got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, I do this thing switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the neopolypoids and end with the
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time, I did a backwards
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to talk about what
happens right after you make a polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brassica napis is classic heterosus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left is a Brassica auracea rapid
cycling plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers in 30 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is Brassica rapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin fast plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle is Brassica napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think virtual has this mini-maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a version of mini-maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Brassica napis is things like this
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial canola is like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we first made them, we can do two
of these a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the origin of this experiment,
I don't know if you remember, but Lauren
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesberg became famous for making three
hybrid sunflowers, three, maybe five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and comparing them to a natural sunflower
and showing that evolution repeated itself
[SPEAKER_00]: when we replayed the evolutionary tape for
chromosome rearrangements in sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tom Osborne, where this project started
in Wisconsin in agronomy, saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, three, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made 100 resynthesized Brassica
napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not in the era of next-gen
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the era of RFLPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could put 50 on a southern blot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why there's 50 and not 100 in
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, what happened is this is
just a portrait of one of the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I self them, self them, self them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like by generation one, two,
three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one became dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ones became early flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ones became late flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they start off with the
same exact homozygous parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: double haploid, we got this huge change in
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how could that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had homozygous parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discovered some stuff, and I'll show
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that big experiment was actually first
thought of from one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1995, Cumming, Song, and Tom Osborne
published a paper where they made some
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they weren't self plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they showed dynamic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people didn't believe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people didn't believe that
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a more careful experiment
where they had inbred lines of rapin
[SPEAKER_00]: loracea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff, was Eric Schronz your undergrad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric Schronz, who was an undergrad here
at Cornell in Jeff's lab, came to
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he actually wanted to work with
Ken Seitzman, but he ended up in Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Osborne's lab doing brassica stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what Eric did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other nice thing is right down the
hallway is Rick Amasino's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like a famous lab for working on
flowering time network in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric had the smart idea to glue what
Amasino's lab was doing in Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: with FLC and Constans with what was going
on in Nebraska, because there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: three copies of these flowering time
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric started to do this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made these crosses and selected for
early and late flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after six generations of selfing,
they're basically two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you throw the seeds out, the early
flowering ones will never see the late
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that happen so fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by the way, this was about the time
when Hopi Hexter and other people were
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot of hay about speciation
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone wanted to find the speciation
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't find a speciation gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we did this big experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made 50 lines that were started so 50
independent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 50 independent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we self them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published the big paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we followed up in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some new stuff next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you first made them, they were
all identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after even five generations of
selfing, they were really diverged,
[SPEAKER_00]: both epigenetically and phenotypically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is the only slide I also
showed in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always show it again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my most important slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to learn how to spell
homeologous after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are rearrangements caused by
homeologous recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the diploid, so in green is Brassica
rapa diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow is Brassica loresicola.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have homologous, 1-O, chromosome
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the allopolypoid, they have
homeologous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have two vowels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one vowel, two vowels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeologous chromosome exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever get that reviewer comment,
how to spell homeologous exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was me or Jim Burchler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of homeologous chromosome
exchanges, you can have, so the exchanges
[SPEAKER_00]: are reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exchanges are reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a result of a punnett square,
you can have nonreciprocal inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get results that look like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also get reciprocal exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these rearrangements can have a huge
effect on dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call them speciation
rearrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that these bubbles are
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say FLC and constans are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica rapa and the big circles flowers
in, say, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica odoracea and the little circles
flowers in, say, 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the midparent flowering time for napis
is 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a chromosome rearrangement on the
one on the top and the one on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the two separate flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that for any pathway,
whether it's flowering time or
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolates or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this happen a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just like the 95-page result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, now we believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only true in your resynthesized
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we re-sync with the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the genome, we found 17 homeologous
exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people said, OK, well,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only occurs in resynthesized Brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a crazy crop, Brassica nevus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't happen in any other crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then after we published this paper,
it was found in wheat, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry, and then Tragapogon,
and a bunch of grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know about homeologous
exchanges and you're doing pan genome work
[SPEAKER_00]: across any group of plants, you should
really think about this as a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation if you're now looking at copy
number variance or presence-absence
[SPEAKER_00]: variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you care if you're a plant breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds pretty obscure to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who cares about these
homeologous.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here is a picture of the
homeologous exchanges across winter
[SPEAKER_00]: canola, darmore, bristol, spring canola,
aviso, some Japanese and Korean types,
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic type, the kale one that I'll
show you next, kale type nevus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a Swede rutabaga.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those colored boxes are homeologous
exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just highlight one in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's glucosinolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glucosinolates, evolution, totally
partly least responsible for by these
[SPEAKER_00]: homeologous exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also see these for all kinds
of other things, and now in other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these 50 lines haven't died,
so we're still replaying the evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this paper was posted on the bio
archive I think two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually called Replaying the
Evolutionary Tape to Investigate Subgenome
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominance in Alapoi Brassica Nevus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin Burr, Chadnita Huth, Malia
Guihan, a bunch of other people led by Pat
[SPEAKER_00]: Edger and Rob Van Buren, they looked
deeply at six of these 50 lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they looked at methylation bias,
homeologous expression, and what are they
[SPEAKER_00]: finding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeated patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really matters if you're thinking
about constraints, what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the mom and who's the dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the same things happening
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you don't have to crisper out
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn something from evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, Margaret, are you my Twitter
person?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's Twitter point number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find, by making synthetic
allopolyploids, you can see things happen
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, like homeologous exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will believe them, because you see
them faster and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think it's an experimental
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually think, oh my god,
homeologous exchanges actually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gene conversion events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're homeologous exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't see them as being
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them as something that are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly, you can see them not
just in Brassica, but in wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut, and a whole bunch of other things
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the history of Brassica?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brassica napis, of course, is known as
part of the triangle view, originated from
[SPEAKER_00]: the combination of Brassica rapa,
the AA genome, and Brassica oleracea,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CC genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So longstanding questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of these vegetables are the parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get Brassica napis,
you have further diversification into
[SPEAKER_00]: oleifera, which is a rapeseed type,
subspecies rapifera, which is rutabaga
[SPEAKER_00]: speed, swede, and pabularia, which is
Siberian kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about multiple origins,
are these different morpho types different
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple origins, or do they diversify
from the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, you have big differences
in both winter and spring types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we started this project,
we had reference genomes for Brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: rapa, Brassica oleracea, and Brassica
napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a massive transcriptome and now
resequencing study, but I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you the transcriptome stuff today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the big question for this,
and this is a study led by Homan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to my lab from Wuhan as a visiting
PhD student and has now stayed on as a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper was just published recently
in Nature Communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: His big question for his PhD project was,
is it true that there's multiple origins
[SPEAKER_00]: of Brassica napis because that's what's in
the literature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's true, how do multiple origins
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the rutabaga suite types evolve from
things like turnip and kohlrabi?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the leafy Siberian kales evolve from
things like the leafy brassicas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the oilseeds evolve from things
like the sarsens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were there multiple origins to one
thing, like an oilseed type, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: diversified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was there a single origin?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the three options for what he
was pursuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so we got a global collection of
Brassica napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike a lot of other studies,
we included rutabaga and Siberian kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did like some really nice, generated a
lot of really nice RNA-seq data and GSS
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the, for those of you who are
interested in methodology, here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: methodological take-home at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really mattered whether you used a
reference genome, a single reference
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, or whether you used a pan
transcriptome or a pan genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The groupings weren't different in
structure, but the biogenetic trees were
[SPEAKER_00]: really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about that,
that would be what I think is the big
[SPEAKER_00]: take-home of this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's home, and this is the paper
that I'm going to be talking about for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few slides that just came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the first big result was we
discovered a new group of Brassica napis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the typical rapeseed types in
Europe and North America and Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have spring types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have Siberian kales and you
have rutabagas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this interesting little
group I'll come back to later,
[SPEAKER_00]: intro s, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now if you make a tree, so this is
where it gets wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always get these four monophyletic
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rutabagas, Siberian kale, winter
rapeseed in East Asia, and spring rapeseed
[SPEAKER_00]: are always one group every time you look
no matter how you look.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other winter rapeseeds that occur in
Europe and America and Asia are
[SPEAKER_00]: paraphyletic mess at the base of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the relationships among that
paraphyletic mess and all those four
[SPEAKER_00]: monophyletic groups really vary depending
on what methods you use to do this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tree building exercises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also network versions of this,
but I'm just showing the cartoon version
[SPEAKER_00]: of it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've been thinking about,
we started with this Brassica napis,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's your mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a baby bird that runs around
asking all the other animals about who's
[SPEAKER_00]: their mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know who the mother is
because I don't think we have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid extant relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then my Chinese postdoc says,
well, you know, that story isn't really an
[SPEAKER_00]: original story.
[SPEAKER_00]: In China we have the story, except it's a
tadpole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he showed me the stamps where the
tadpole runs around and asks the fish and
[SPEAKER_00]: the crab and who's your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't realize this is one of those
cross-cultural stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you my mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't figured this out for napis
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so just to finish up this,
what this paper had in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found these six Brassica napis
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of admixture across them,
particularly the oilseed varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't confirm what the general tale is
that multiple origins happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that it's actually more like
back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear organo-phylogenies actually
showed that that intro S group that we
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered is when, so in China,
they used to grow Brassica rapa for the
[SPEAKER_00]: oilseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after World War II, they grew Brassica
napis, but they back-crossed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica rapa for disease resistance and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that group is, is just the
introgress Chinese group that's got these
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I didn't talk about it today,
but basically we looked really hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the selective sweeps we found focusing
on rutabagas and Siberian kales because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else is looking at the oilseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of phytohormones to chase
down and other kind of metabolic things to
[SPEAKER_00]: go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like with Brassica rapa napis,
there's this obvious sub-genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: both physical asymmetry and expression
asymmetry and how things show themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where we're going with next on this
is I think Mike Gore and John McKay and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of people have pan-genomes of a
bunch of the canola types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making pan-genomes of rutabagas and
Siberian kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully someday we'll bring all these
together and have a big party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we're crispering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is doing oilseeds and
glucosimilates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually going after some other
targets that nobody else cares about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my... Ed, this is your slide
number two for you and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maize sub-genome assignments are
problematic if they're just sorghum and
[SPEAKER_00]: maize comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need other genomes to fill in who the
parents are to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still biased fractionation,
but it's going to be done differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, as a good systematist and
phylogeneticist, move away from pairwise
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons to phylogenomic comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's message number one, no matter what
your omics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then think about the modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you model what deleterious
alleles you want to go after using the
[SPEAKER_00]: framework of both phylogenomics and
population genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spelled this out in a 2018 paper in
ARES.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've had a couple of some other
thought pieces about this, both with
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaurav and AJB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah Turner has song and Jeff Ross in a
bar and I talked about these evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: insights impacting plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, reading 5.0?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we would call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and this is an older paper,
but I actually read it on the plane out
[SPEAKER_00]: here, Jacob Washburn and some of us wrote
this paper on convergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there are some nice ideas
in there about thinking about constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just end by acknowledging my
funding store sources, including USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is new for me because I have friends
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: National Geographic is new, so now I get
to have music or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that means exactly for
National Geographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't talk about it today,
but we have a small DOE grant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not DOD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using BRASC as a low dose radiation
sensor, which actually we can just plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the other stuff that we got going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And JGI has given us a ton of data and I
didn't talk about an orchid mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi project today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the people that do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked mostly about the work done by
McKinsey, Holman.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new students who are working on
various projects that have to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up, mostly CRISPR and functional
genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have had this great visiting
scientist from China this year who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: helping us with double haploid and CRISPR
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm most proud of our lab is our
undergrads because they come in as
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever pre-meds or not knowing anything
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they end up going to grad schools and
grad school all over the world doing cool
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun last fun fact, if you didn't know it,
pumpkins were really, really cool for
[SPEAKER_00]: people because like they used to carve
turnips and rutabaga and it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and you got your hands all bloody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our lab has an annual turnip carving
party, rutabaga party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do something like this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But home much prefers to carve pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear as mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Gara.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you showed the two genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was, I guess, an LF.
[SPEAKER_04]: The least I went through was a
fractionated copy and another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that in MF1 and MF2 that many
of the genes are fractionated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the model that was presented was that
Prasika is sending out all emergency
[SPEAKER_04]: responders when they're stressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it that it's just that gene is on
the way to pseudogenization and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: retains some of the activities that were
there before by chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a selective response for Prasika
instead of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, if Gavin kind of would hear
you, he would love your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually wrote a paper about noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you need the phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to distinguish noise,
which I would say are things on the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudogenization versus things that are
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By sub-functionalization, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had true, original force and length
sub-functionalization, you're stuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's these things that it's kind of
noisy and they're on their way out again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I like your work on enzymes
because, OK, so in polyploidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does everyone want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see polyploidy on a tree,
and they want to map that where that
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploidy even occurs, you have
diversification.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you have polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then evolution's got to tinker
around and figure out how the enzymes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find their substrates or figure
out how they're going to do their
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a novel trait,
and then they can diversify, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the time lag?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, thinking about AI or whatever,
what's the time frame that I want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at after polyploidy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how far is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What pathway am I looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to look at the meso-polyploid
events, the alpha-beta events,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the brassica-napis event?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what your enzyme you're
working on or whatever, but for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I would start with answering
a question or whether it's cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these, I think, are fixed if
they have really deep partitioning between
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing we've been trying to
model is, so Jim Weisskaber and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been thinking about, well, if I really
want to know about the glucosaminate
[SPEAKER_00]: module, how do I spread my dollars between
different species, accessions within a
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and tissues and time points,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, OK, well, let's think about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some idea about how big the
module is, you can figure that out,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what the gold standard stress is that's
going to do five things instead of one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, copper sulfate instead of methyl
jasmine, maybe, or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so some of these are noisy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when we look at a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you a canonical example,
but in a pop-gen framework, and maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: other things, like they don't look as
clean as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe the pseudogenizing and that
Arabidopsis-cold line, but not in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis layer, or I don't know if that
answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just looking at a snapshot,
which is why you need to test notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still thinking the process of the
de-domestication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really love your example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes through 1,000 ideas all in a
couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thinking about that, one thing you
notice is that you get these trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a trend towards woodiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a trend from the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start thinking about the things
that cause the domestication by what is
[SPEAKER_02]: the release of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constraint again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the woodiness was on islands,
where you see plants growing woody anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any insights that are jumping
out from that that you hadn't maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: thought of that are providing an idea of
what that canalization process is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and why you don't see such an overwhelming
diversity of forms, given the overwhelming
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic potential and variation that's out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you repeat a short version of a
question for people on Zoom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see canalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any sort of phenotypic insights
coming out of the de-domestication that
[SPEAKER_02]: provide ideas about variation in genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do we see any patterns
of de-domestication that may tell us about
[SPEAKER_00]: some central process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, though, again, it's like,
what's the scale of the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we trying to figure out, OK,
in Brassica, how does Brassica become
[SPEAKER_00]: woody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we want to look at, like,
well, how do all flowering plants become
[SPEAKER_00]: woody?
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at Asteraceae, also, and some
other ones, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a project in Europe where
people are looking at woodiness evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: both naturally on islands and also these
kind of de-domesticated types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to narrow the question a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that share the same hexaploidy
in the Brassiceae, what's the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between things that were perennial that
then became more woody versus things that
[SPEAKER_00]: were domesticated and herbaceous and now
become woody?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I learn about woodiness from the
difference between those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there constraints?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it always the same little switch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same little transcription
factors over and over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions I can't answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can look philosophical,
like I know you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one more question, then we got to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you framed the Brassica versus the
Arabidopsis thing with the helicopter and
the boat and all that kind of stuff.
Nice.
Is that OK?
Yeah, I like it a lot.
But Arabidopsis had that opportunity,
too, in our earlier Brassiceae.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, it didn't go that same route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your thought about the negative
aspects of maintaining some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: options, maintaining extra copies of
genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you mostly have gene loss due to
drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, we all know that genome size
is a huge cost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Arabidopsis' entire lifecycle
occurs in the time span that Lilium does
[SPEAKER_00]: meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had to choose, oh, vast and weedy,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think, trying to broaden your
question, or thinking about constraint,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different ways to have variation,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like splice variants or transposons,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just focusing on my own research
program is just trying to focus on tandem
[SPEAKER_00]: versus polyploid duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of ways that variation
could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, there's genomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think of genomic architecture,
that's what I'm thinking of is this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of network architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what did Arabidopsis give up by
giving up those other networks,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a pretty fast speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a pretty fast boat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I poorly answer another question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm two for two on zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it time to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to go.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be here.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
