[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Kirsten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage the actual lab itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we do the root bioassay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root bioassay is a way for us to look
at the amount of fungal pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically diseases that may be present
in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to first clarify by saying that
most of the diseases that we look for,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Pythian, Pusarium, Pia Biopsis,
and Rhizectonia, are present in most soil
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all everywhere, but one of
these is probably basically everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're actually measuring is the
health of your soil and the ability for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant to outgrow that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going through and looking and
saying, yes, I can identify Pusarium,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at it like, yeah, that's Pusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to contact the grower
and say, I saw Pusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a soil person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can say is that you have less
or more pressure on your actual plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we would do is we would assign
them a rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ratings are based from 2 to 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might wonder, why isn't it 1 to 10?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically because 1 would be a
perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't think that really exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 10 is completely dead, completely
failed, absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we keep it more in that range,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, the best rating that I do a
plant is a 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it really fills up the tube,
you guys have a chance to see what this
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, 3, if you get a 3 or 4,
your soil is doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really means that we don't see any
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get something more like a 7 or 8,
that's a really serious issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's telling us that you then,
your agricultural consultant, that's you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, the grower, that means that you need
to send your soil to a pathogen soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab and figure out exactly what
you have going on because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: different management strategies for these
four different types of diseases that we
[SPEAKER_01]: look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grow these beans in this highly
stressful situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On purpose, it's very hot in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these diseases are encouraged by
high soil temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all sorts of stress through
these wet tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we expect that if there is evidence
there, if your soil's not strong enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: outgrow it, we're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use these high-style snap beans,
which we know are highly susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: these diseases naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds have been treated with various
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list right here on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Captan, Streptomycin,
you know, kind of the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason for this is because
most people are using treated seed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason for this is that if your
plant can't, is still getting these
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases and working with these treated
seeds, that's really telling us there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: major issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't treat these seeds,
these plants would not survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them kind of would, but it would
be really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over here you can see, you know,
all day long we've been talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive management and the side,
or good caldwell, bad caldwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our shorthand in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, this is good caldwell,
bad caldwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right away, I think that you can see a
visual difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were planted on the same day.
[SPEAKER_01]: These also were planted on the same day.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, I pulled from, I had a 200 sample
sent to me earlier this year for this
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all of our tests on a heart rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we really specify that,
so I want to make sure everyone knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can send in just for available water
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these had very bad reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all sevens and eights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I planted these on purpose in hopes
that we can see some evidence of disease
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can show you kind of what we're
building at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, these have only been growing
for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically we don't harvest until four or
five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the evidence is very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting to see some evidence
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had planted them sooner, if I wasn't
so busy with our lab becoming extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: popular, I would have gotten these out
here sooner and you would see a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more evidence, but we've been looking at
them all day and we are seeing some
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each sample gets four reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, these are, like go over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are actually soil health samples
that I am telling you right now are having
[SPEAKER_01]: some serious issues with the surface of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't get enough soil,
they only get one rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something, you know,
as a lab manager, I really have been kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of pushing this all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need enough soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get better data and it also
costs us a lot of labor to have to stretch
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, these guys, those guys,
I had to replant because they were total
[SPEAKER_01]: failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones where you don't see anything
coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will replant after three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I'm saying, okay, the seed is
over 90% of your management rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that you got a really
serious issue going on in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can see these guys didn't
quite set up soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only get three reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the average of the four reps,
assuming they send us enough soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you guys have any questions before
I kind of move into showing you how they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah, I think that the main
point about this test really is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the suppressive capacity of your
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to see like how healthy that
soil is and if it can actually push past
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not testing how much pathogen
pressure you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, of course, that is a factor and
that's gonna influence this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really, truly just looking at
whether or not it can power through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so what we do is we use these,
we call them bean tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that these are actually used for
starting trees, generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we take clean cotton ball and place it
in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of this is to ensure that it
drains properly and also to keep the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: from falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the only greenhouses on
campus that actually use soil in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people working in greenhouses are
using media, various things that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you all probably know, there's a lot of
potentially dangerous things in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these issues that we look for
really are huge problems in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'm very careful to keep
everything extremely clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very clean greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sterilized regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these racks and these trays,
I sterilize between every batch to just
[SPEAKER_01]: like minimize as much as possible anything
spreading and throwing this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all said, this is really a visual
test, as you're gonna see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see with this picture over here,
we're really looking at kind of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at, so this would probably
be a three or a four, probably a four.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was whiter, I would probably give it
a three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably more like an eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that look way worse than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets into the nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine's pretty much a complete damping off
failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of an idea of how the
ratings move.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't the best picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see like, oh, well, this is darker
than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that get a worse rating?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you look more closely,
you can see the darkness moving up the
[SPEAKER_01]: stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is evidence of the specific things
we're looking at, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are pictures of actual samples
that have come through the soil health
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see epithium, something that a lot
of us are probably pretty familiar with,
[SPEAKER_01]: the damping off, and then the fusarium,
which was probably what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm in soils, not plant
craft, but I'm learning more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see the lesions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some samples come through here
where the lesions are all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move all the way up the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's going to be in the eighth,
ninth range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they call us, their
agricultural consultants should be telling
[SPEAKER_01]: them, look, you need to send your soil to
a plant lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to figure out what's actually
going on so you can actually manage this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of another example of something
where this would be more in the three
[SPEAKER_01]: range, and this would be more in the
seven, eight range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say, and we see stuff like this all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we take our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good Caldwell, bad Caldwell,
again, forgive me for shortening things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do it with everything up here
because it's lots of big words and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: talking, and it just is easier like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do kind of want to point out the soil
just because it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's a lot to be
learned from fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually pull, as soon as we get the
sample in, we pull it that day or the next
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get it right out there in the
greenhouse because this does take the four
[SPEAKER_01]: to five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another refinement I started this
year just to try to help us get this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: out as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, yeah, this is the world's most
comprehensive soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see some differences here,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it, just right off the bat,
the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good is much darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the organic matter is
much higher visually to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, of course, I know I wish
that we had time to show you guys the
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this field, which has been in
wheat for 20 years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wheat was like this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a terrible looking,
nasty field, cracking, all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, flooding, versus the sod.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing great, no problem at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's some kind of a long-term
reading something, but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it's one of the greater
skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's kind of one cool thing
about Canvas is that, especially Bob,
[SPEAKER_01]: he really knows he's been here forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows these fields that have been
basically abused and beaten down for as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as he's been here, 30 years or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been crazy like that for 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started in the 80s, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knows the history of a lot of these
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go and pull some soil because we
know what it's going to do, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can predict that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pulled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran it through the soil health test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys all saw those reports,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right there behind there with the
air-dried soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really see it's an extreme
difference in these areas right next to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to talk about how the management
actually is affecting the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really phenomenal thing,
I think, especially for people who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, though, what we do as far as
the actual planting is we take the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and we run it through a four-millimeter
sieve, just a bit.
Just like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it I knock out and I push
aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this soil has gone through an
eight-millimeter sieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're familiar with sieving?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of look at this and say,
we do a lot of sieving, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as much as we used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen the grinder
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don, have you guys been to G01?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a new innovation this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has saved us so much time on
sieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my first year or two,
as far as all I did, I felt like so
[SPEAKER_01]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take the soil that's gone through
the eight and we put it in a labeled tube
bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have four wraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just label the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, when I do this,
I keep my bag of soil in front of me or
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage any of our techs to do the same
so that you don't ever lose track.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little bit more core about.
[SPEAKER_01]: No mistakes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you pretty much have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple checking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably driving crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really important to be literally
a triple check for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take the seed and I put it on its
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this is really important
because it seems like such a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have it kind of facing up,
it'll actually send its roots out first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will just have such a harder time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned so many tricks to help
encourage these to grow in what's
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally a highly stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just take about half an inch of
soil, the sieved soil, and I put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of trying to make this easier
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to just be able to pop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to germinate in a day or two,
which they will if they're properly taken
[SPEAKER_01]: care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go on the rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always positioned like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every other row so that they have
space and we can avoid any
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-contamination when we're watering
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I water these beans personally by hand
with a hose that I have set to go right
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of have it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on very low volume and I come out
here every single day, even Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I water these because I have a strong
background in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have gotten killed by people
forgetting to water on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, I live in Fall Creek downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that big a deal to grow up here
to be sure that they're going to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just a little part of what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right, so that they're planted,
they're grown for five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're harvested, which I can
show you guys over here what that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all the good and bad
Caldwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these are the a la carte samples
that I received earlier this year that had
[SPEAKER_01]: really terrible ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that we're going to see some
evidence of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that these are all really
wilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because I didn't water them this
morning on purpose in preparation for
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting them so that the soil will just
fall off the roots and it won't break off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another thing, kind of a
learning curve thing that we learned to
[SPEAKER_01]: just save time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always, I'm super obsessed with
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all obsessed with just trying to
make this as unlabor intensive as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best way to put it,
but if you guys want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I loosen up the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just whack it out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then typically you would throw the
tube down to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is usually a two person job.
[SPEAKER_01]: One person would be doing this part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other person would be doing the
washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you would lay your tube with the
samples right next to it in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the person follows along and
washes the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good Caldwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right off the bat, I can tell you I'm
seeing good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see these are kind of shaped like the
tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see they kind of fiddled the tube out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just this little piddling of a
root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we go through and we actually wash
them by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really important step because I
personally rate these beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assign them their rating between two and
nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Bob Schindlback comes and he
checks my ratings and almost always
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusts them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's been doing the ratings for
these since the beginning of the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was part of the original package on
the test in 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be sure that it's
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't want a farmer to get a seven
one year and get a six another year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not actually true.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it is a visual assessment,
because it is, you know, something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could kind of have a bias towards,
perhaps, you know, they're very careful to
[SPEAKER_01]: double check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to pass these around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks clean to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see, I didn't maybe see a tiny bit
of evidence right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a little bit of darkening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not seeing much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet this is around a three and a half or
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in contrast, we've got the bad
Caldwell, which we don't know because I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't, when we ran this for the soil
health test, we didn't actually do the
[SPEAKER_01]: boot bean root bioassay because of course
it's not included in our standard
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to leave some in here out of
my own curiosity to get to their full age
[SPEAKER_01]: so that I can determine if how much
disease pressure is actually on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep these alive for
another probably week and then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest them and give them an actual
rating just so we know for our own
[SPEAKER_01]: reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bad Caldwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one for some reason had two seeds
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exactly the standard,
but it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think right off the bat,
we can see a little bit of a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking this into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really looking at the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like what I showed you guys,
we're looking at the plant overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something that we do as part of
our assessment because what are we going
[SPEAKER_01]: to compare it to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as just my own curiosity,
I'm taking that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely for this purpose,
I'm going to be looking at these compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely I can see some evidence
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see some dark spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that starting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in another week, I guarantee that this
will go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of look at it along with
those and you can really see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've of course talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have talked to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be really interesting in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the kind of thing that you
could, if you're a researcher,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we could tell you we see some
pressure, then you can take those next
[SPEAKER_01]: steps or send it into the fat lab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of a way, it's like
Penaria and a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just, we're saying like,
look, we can see some evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to then take the next step to see
what's going on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to tell you like anything
specifically about these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have control at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do grow the same, we grow soil that we
know what to predict from regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in our research plots and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we don't, this is actually the
only test that we don't have a quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control with every batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do something like that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much it would necessarily
influence things because what are we going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some like pythium infested soil and
grow that along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tricky thing, but yeah,
I've been thinking about it maybe in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so these guys, like I said,
they've only been in here for three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the five week mark, they had
really, really terrible storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think right off the bat, we can start
to see some issues, even if it's for three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These marks, that doesn't come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see why this is fitting there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so right, so looking at the goods
compared to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well we do enough of our own
research that we have stuff out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of like, I mean,
I've harvested thousands of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sort of have a database in my mind of
what where it falls in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As strange as that sounds, that's really
how it is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really visually learn quite a
bit from just looking at these roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do think that it's really a valuable
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a thing that we think is more
specific for specific people these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of our standard test
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in our comprehensive or as an
add on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a vegetable farmer,
you probably would really want to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend this to your vegetable
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we see nodules all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've thought about, we've talked a little
bit about maybe marking down if we see
[SPEAKER_01]: nodules or not, kind of as an additional
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many more things we can do with
everything that we do out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we're just, we're trying to get
these results out as rapidly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're dealing with a unprecedented
volume of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we definitely talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also talked about doing a clean seed
thing a little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like actually super long term and both
can see what kind of weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some talks mostly from
outside of our team, people coaching me
[SPEAKER_01]: and asking me if that's something I might
be interested in looking into someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of, that's kind of
the cool thing about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always refining our tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always improving our tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always looking for new and novel
ways to show and talk about what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this test changes every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this year we did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we came up with the grinder and
the siever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We changed the way that we can get the
water for the accurate stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: The texture sink, which are Jamie's will
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should prepare an eye design.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that cut our texture time in
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, removing this from the standard
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like half a mile away that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first year as a temporary lab tent,
I had to push back the soil on a cart
[SPEAKER_01]: across campus, soaked in sweat through all
the undergrads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, oh, we're doing enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me a dirt bear,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
