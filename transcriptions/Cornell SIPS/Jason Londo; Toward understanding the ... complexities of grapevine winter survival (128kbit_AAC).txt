[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for showing up today,
and thank you for giving me a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to you about my research.
[SPEAKER_05]: As Joyce said, I work for the USDA up in
Geneva, and I work on grapevines.
[SPEAKER_05]: My position is as a research geneticist.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the USDA, we have these specific sort
of regions that we work on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mine is abiotic stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of our location in Western New
York, the most important abiotic stress
[SPEAKER_05]: from grapevine's point of view is winter
stress, cold stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you can see a vineyard just south
of Geneva in the middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that it's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really fun place to work if you
have the appropriate clothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from the vine's point of view,
this is very stressful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no foliage.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vine shut down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doing its very best to survive
complexity of winter temperatures and make
[SPEAKER_05]: it to spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to go over a whole bunch of
concepts, but that's the basic
[SPEAKER_05]: overwhelming part of my talk is how do
grapevines make it through winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we go very far, I just want to
acknowledge my student, Al Kovaleski.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of what I'm going to present today
has come out of his thesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really pushed this program in a way
that I didn't think it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's the brawn behind this and the
brain behind most of this talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to introduce grapevine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vitus vinifera is the cultivated form of
grape that gives us these four wonderful
[SPEAKER_05]: endpoints.
[SPEAKER_05]: The products at the base here,
that was advancing the slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wine, table grapes, juice grapes,
and raisins.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vast majority of global production
comes from this one species.
[SPEAKER_05]: This species was domesticated from its
wild ancestor, Sylvester, in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Mediterranean region of Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important to us from a winter
temperature point of view and an
[SPEAKER_05]: adaptation point of view, because if you
look at what the minimum temperatures
[SPEAKER_05]: along the Mediterranean coasts are,
you can see that they're not that bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Red and orange is negative 1 to 4 C for
red.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are very mild winters from our
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a hot, dry summer, cool,
mild winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's not a lot of need for
strong freeze resistance in vitus
[SPEAKER_05]: vinifera.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still doesn't do a bad job of surviving
winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can survive to temperatures about
negative 13 F.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to primarily speak in Celsius,
because that's how we take our
[SPEAKER_05]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_05]: So negative 25 degrees Celsius is sort of
the limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative 13 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we care about cold hardness,
because temperature is one of the leading
[SPEAKER_05]: factors that limit where we can grow the
crops that we grow, and for sure for
[SPEAKER_05]: grapevines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you can see in this map,
this little black star in the top right
[SPEAKER_05]: corner, that's Geneva.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this arc is the 44th north latitude
that goes through France and Italy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our latitude is comparable with the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see by the color graph,
we're nowhere near that red and brown
[SPEAKER_05]: coloring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much colder here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The value of the New York grape industry
is somewhere between $52 and $70 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we have a really bad winter,
you can suffer up to $50 million worth of
[SPEAKER_05]: damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that depends very much on the type of
winter, where it strikes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go into the Midwest, they can have
almost complete crop loss from a bad
[SPEAKER_05]: winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: In New York, we tend to grow grapes in
very specific regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the bottom map here in purple are the
primary wine regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two colors of purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you can see the lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at the hardiness map,
those purple areas overlap completely with
[SPEAKER_05]: the green areas in the hardiness map.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because we grow cultivated grape
right on its margin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at a spot where you cannot be sure
that Vitus Vinifera will survive every
[SPEAKER_05]: single year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Low temperature associated stresses affect
Vitus Vinifera globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a map.
[SPEAKER_05]: In purple are high frost risk areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with this particular aspect of cold
hardiness, we're talking about the buds
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking early in spring before the last
threat of frost has passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a frost, it freezes off your
growing tissues, which includes your
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means no crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see it affects it globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this interplays a lot with the way
that global climate is starting to shift.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, pictured in red areas in
California, the Northeast, and in Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: are areas where we grow grapes now,
or could grow grapes, now, climatically,
[SPEAKER_05]: that are expected to get too hot in the
summer to produce grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to shift towards these
blue areas in each case.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you shift north, that may give us the
right summer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that puts us at risk of more winter
temperatures, because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily mean warmer all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have seen that winters are getting
warmer in our region about 1 degree
[SPEAKER_05]: Fahrenheit per decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from 1970, we've warmed to about 5
or 6 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the trend of the minimum
winter temperatures, it is also going up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's getting warmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our winter extremes are getting less.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also want to point out here that the
range in winter extremes goes from
[SPEAKER_05]: negative 19 to 6 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while it may be warmer overall,
the variation in those killing events is
[SPEAKER_05]: still very high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you put those together,
it becomes very problematic for consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: grapevine production.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plays into how global change and
warming winters affects the risk of freeze
[SPEAKER_05]: events.
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, a strong jet stream protects
Arctic air.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps it trapped at the poles.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we warm in winter, particularly in
the Arctic, that jet stream gets weaker,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is shown here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that Arctic air can break out more
often.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see that manifest here in this
thermograph.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the polar vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: When polar vortex became a thing again a
couple of years ago, we had this breakout
[SPEAKER_05]: of polar air that plunged down through the
Midwest, caused a lot of damage and a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the sort of event that will
kill grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they get a mild winter,
they're not prepared for this drastic
[SPEAKER_05]: switch.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that we have been dealing with
this challenge on the margins is by
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding new cold hardy hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we use wild grapevine species in
the genus Vitis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in North America, there's probably
about 20 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Asia, there's probably another 40.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pictured here are some distribution maps
for different wild grape species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is some pictures of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We typically use Vitis riparia,
which hopefully you can tell the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference in the green here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lime green is the county level
distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very widespread species that goes
well up into Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens to be one of the most cold
hardy species that survives the coldest
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wild grape can survive to around
negative 35 to negative 40 C.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's about a 10 to 15 degree C
increase in ability to survive winters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of our cultivar improvement for
freeze resistance comes from these wild
[SPEAKER_05]: species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't breed cold hardiness out of
vinifera.
[SPEAKER_05]: It simply doesn't have the tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we talk about winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also very complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about half of the year at
least, maybe about eight months,
[SPEAKER_05]: extends from fall through the dormancy
period of winter into spring bud burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: During the time, we have a number of
different cold-related stresses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frost is very important in the fall and in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get an early frost in the fall,
you can defoliate the vine, and that cuts
[SPEAKER_05]: off its ability to prepare for winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get a frost in the spring,
you lose your floral tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also have cold extremes throughout
the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the vine isn't prepared in early,
mid, or late winter, you can suffer bud
[SPEAKER_05]: damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that has the same effect as killing
the vine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we call this acclimation, maximum
hardness, or maintenance, and
[SPEAKER_05]: deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the two major concepts for
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dormancy and cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dormancy is the period of the vine
basically being asleep, keeping its growth
[SPEAKER_05]: from occurring during temperatures that
are not growth permissible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's necessary for grapevine to go through
this for it to have synchronous bud burst
[SPEAKER_05]: and synchronous flowering in the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other concept is cold hardiness,
which is very complex, but it involves
[SPEAKER_05]: freeze hardiness, freeze tolerance,
super cooling, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_05]: factors that all go into the general idea
of the vine survives all the freezing
[SPEAKER_05]: events of that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do all of our work on dormant wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically with the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so these are cuttings of grape,
each cut into a single node.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a little bud here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see some zoom-ins later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do all of our work taking samples
from the field and then doing growth
[SPEAKER_05]: chamber experiments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the primary aspect of my research
program is twofold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually describing the phenotype of what
cold hardiness is, because this is
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's super complex and we need
to be able to target aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think of it as four things.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the vine prepare for winter?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it prevent changes in physiology
that result in growth?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it survive some freezing
temperatures?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how does it time bud burst in the
spring?
[SPEAKER_05]: So those four factors are the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from the genetic point of view,
we wanna know what the genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: architecture of all these traits are.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we know from all abiotic stresses is
that it's polygenic, lots of different
[SPEAKER_05]: genes playing roles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at other literature,
we see that cold often uses the same
[SPEAKER_05]: stress pathways as salt, drought,
heat, and ABA exposure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically the idea is that all
these abiotic stresses activate a suite of
[SPEAKER_05]: transcription factors that activate an
even larger suite of downstream genes to
[SPEAKER_05]: cause changes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we expect a lot of crosstalk when
we start unraveling some of the genes
[SPEAKER_05]: behind this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect to find things for drought and
for salinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we cover a little bit of some of
these terms, just so we're all on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: page, we wanna talk a little bit about
dormancy and chilling requirement.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bud is a really interesting entity in
that it is isolated from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_05]: vine during the winter, it's sealed off,
and it is able to measure the length of
[SPEAKER_05]: winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It measures it through some sort of clock
system that we don't quite understand,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that clock runs between zero and 11
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when the temperatures outside drop
below 11 degrees Celsius, the buds start
[SPEAKER_05]: counting.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it drops below freezing, they stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the winter, they need to accumulate a
certain amount in order to be ready to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow in the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you go out to the field and you
grab a cutting while this clock is running
[SPEAKER_05]: and you put it in the greenhouse,
it won't grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is called endodormancy, a specific
type of dormancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So internal dormancy where some
physiological parameters are suppressing
[SPEAKER_05]: growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, the clock is fulfilled and
the buds transition to something called
[SPEAKER_05]: ecodormancy, where if you go and you take
that bud and then remove it from the
[SPEAKER_05]: field, say in February, it's still too
cold to grow, but you put it inside,
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll now grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this suppression has been released and
now dormancy is enforced by the
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two different interactions,
these two different dormancy parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: The length of that brown bar, the
endodormancy barrier, can be determined by
[SPEAKER_05]: genetic differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So different species can have different
amounts of that clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can also be determined by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a very cold location,
the clock needs to run a long time because
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't spend a lot of time in that
temperature zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a very mild climate,
the clock is always running so that arrow,
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively speaking, gets smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is important because if you
transition to this ecodormant state in an
[SPEAKER_05]: area that gets late winter snap freezes,
you can damage the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once it moves into this ecodormant
state, it's much more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We measure this by taking cuttings,
putting them into a growth chamber,
[SPEAKER_05]: giving them doses of chill, and then
seeing how long it takes them to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when their chilling requirement is
fully met, they'll all burst
[SPEAKER_05]: synchronously.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's not fully met, you get
asynchronous burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a problem in the field because if
you get asynchronous burst, you get
[SPEAKER_05]: asynchronous flowering and fruiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And farmers don't like to have to harvest
at multiple times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Data-wise, if you plot the days of bud
burst versus the chilling hours,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get this relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more chilling that a vine gets in that
clock region, the faster it gets at
[SPEAKER_05]: growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you also look at it this way,
it also gets more synchronous.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these two parameters are combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're planting a certain variety,
you have to keep dormancy and the chilling
[SPEAKER_05]: requirement in mind because not all
varieties can be grown everywhere from
[SPEAKER_05]: this standpoint alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at these two parameters,
the chilling hours that accumulate across
[SPEAKER_05]: the United States, you can see here in
Western New York, we get lots,
[SPEAKER_05]: 1,500 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because we've got the Great Lakes,
the Finger Lakes, and the ocean nearby.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes us very mild.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look in North and South Dakota,
they have less chilling hours than we do,
[SPEAKER_05]: even though their winter is much harsher
than us because that clock is stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's below freezing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you plant a high chill variety in
North or South Dakota, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: break bud on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing happens when the south is
too warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't get a peach harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't get enough chilling for
peaches, for apples, for all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different fruit crops, you won't get
synchronous burst and synchronous
[SPEAKER_05]: fruiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we just look quickly at two years,
2012, 2013 was warm for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had 1,600 hours of chill by the end of
the winter, whereas in South Dakota,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the same time point, they only had
1,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you would be able to plant
varieties that have chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: That require a lot of chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you plant it in South Dakota,
it wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to a cold year, you can see that
here we lost 300 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to be very aware of the
chilling requirements of the crops that we
[SPEAKER_05]: plant because you can inadvertently plant
something that's not going to do well here
[SPEAKER_05]: from a reduction point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we then look at different wild
grapevine species, we see that that
[SPEAKER_05]: response is shared across all wild
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: All wild species get faster at growing
with increasing chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But their position on the y-axis,
both at the start of winter and at the
[SPEAKER_05]: end, is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there are differences in the chill
response, high, medium, and low.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at them geographically by
the distribution, it looks like southern
[SPEAKER_05]: species typically need longer winters than
northern species.
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems like a bit of a paradox because
you would think that a northern species
[SPEAKER_05]: would want to be prepared for a long
winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is from the point of view of that
clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a northern winter is actually a very
short clock winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we see here is a potential
adaptive trait based on geography.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can now target these different
species for different dormancy,
[SPEAKER_05]: chilling requirement aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to bring your attention back
to riparia because we use riparia a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: for cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that it's on the northern
distribution, low chill response side.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the germplasm in Geneva, I have access
to lots of different accessions from
[SPEAKER_05]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we looked at 43 of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we group them into southern and
northern groups and you squint a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit at it, you can see that the blue is on
the lower side and the orange is on the
[SPEAKER_05]: upper side.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like, and then the color
coding is preserved here in this column,
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks like things from the south tend
to have slightly longer dormancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like that species level,
distribution north to south is possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: preserved within widely dispersed species
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there may be a gradient within riparia
for the same trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is cool because now we have
riparias that we can use to breed for
[SPEAKER_05]: longer winters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want that for up here because we
have what the clock thinks is a really
[SPEAKER_05]: long winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're now working with the grapevine
breeder in Cornell to use some of this
[SPEAKER_05]: material for breeding rather than choosing
the stuff from Manitoba, which is believed
[SPEAKER_05]: to be very cold hardy but has a very short
requirement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dormancy protects the buds from growing
when the temperatures are lethal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two parts of dormancy to protect
against temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one portion where it's
protecting against temperature and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: another portion where it's very responsive
to temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dormancy level and the chilling
requirement is important for what types of
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars you plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like there's a geographic
gradient for this trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool to me from a sort
of like a natural adaptation, natural
[SPEAKER_05]: evolution kind of point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part of my research that
overlaps with dormancy is the ability of
[SPEAKER_05]: the bud to survive freezing events.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a picture of a grapevine bud that
has been cut and then split open.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the base of the bud here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is sort of like the decapitated
top of the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in the center there is a dead
primary bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a compound bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three buds in there, the primary,
the secondary, and the tertiary.
[SPEAKER_05]: The primary is the weakest and has the
floral tissue for the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this particular picture, you can see
the primary is dead and oxidized and the
[SPEAKER_05]: secondary and tertiary are still alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this had a precise cold treatment that
killed only the primary.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can determine the temperature that
kills the primary through this
[SPEAKER_05]: differential thermal analysis method.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we cut the bud off of the cane.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put them in these little chambers in
these plates and then put the plates in a
[SPEAKER_05]: programmable freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We slowly freeze the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we measure voltage across that plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what we're doing is we're
measuring the freezing of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as temperature decreases, there's this
large spike in voltage as external water
[SPEAKER_05]: freezes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a heat release which changes the
voltage of the plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: As the extracellular water freezes over
time as the temperatures are decreasing,
[SPEAKER_05]: the bud is surviving all of this,
presumably dehydrating at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as you go back and forth
between these two stages, freezing and
[SPEAKER_05]: thawing, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only when that internal water freezes is
it lethal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we measure here.
[SPEAKER_05]: These little spikes are five primary buds
dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take the average of that and then we
can plot the survivability through winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two curves down here in purple and
green are CabSav and Riesling,
[SPEAKER_05]: two vinifera varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that U-shaped curve I
showed you earlier, acclimation,
[SPEAKER_05]: maintenance, and deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each of these points are the average of
the lethal events for those buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of what we're doing is trying to
understand how the buds are changing
[SPEAKER_05]: through winter because we want to
understand how to maximize their ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some really cool models that
have come out where they're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: predict bud hardiness so that farmers have
a tool for when they need to go out and
[SPEAKER_05]: make viticulture modifications.
[SPEAKER_05]: To deal with cold events.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best current model is this Ferguson
model.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I want to show you here is how
bad the Ferguson model is in the East.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works really great in Washington State
where it was developed on like 23
[SPEAKER_05]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you see here in black is actual data
and then in orange is the prediction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that it has problems in both
the early and late parts of winter in over
[SPEAKER_05]: predicting hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the problem if you're using this
as a farming tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also has a hard pan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't, the buds can't gain hardiness
past a certain level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working with this model and the
different aspects of cold hardiness to try
[SPEAKER_05]: to correct it and then also learn a bit
more about phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm showing here are three years of
data for three different species.
[SPEAKER_05]: In blue is Vitis vinifera.
[SPEAKER_05]: In green and yellow are Vitis riparia and
Vitis emurences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two species are very cold hardy.
[SPEAKER_05]: One from North America, one from Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2012, 2013 it's a very warm year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh actually before we get into that let's
look at some general trends.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we see with our data, our cold
hardiness data is that when you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: cold event in winter the buds tend to
respond by gaining cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have a warming event they tend to
respond by losing cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not always true at all points in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see in this particular year the
first cold event resulted in acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second cold event only resulted in an
acclimation in the yellow cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this year the trend is reversed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first cold event had no effect,
the second one dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to figure out what makes
these cold events different?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the vine actually queuing off of?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at Vitis... It looks like there
was a little more integrated cold in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean they're all working together,
doing the same thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it looks like the environment was a
little colder in the middle one than in
[SPEAKER_02]: the right one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well between these three years there are
actually three perfect comparisons.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very warm year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one cold event.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the freezing point here and these
are minimum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this year we had very punctuated
winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cold, warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cold, warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year we had tremendous sustained
cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you were all here for this
but this was like the two and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: months of nothing but freezing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're very different winters from the
vine's point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at Amurense's maximum cold
hardiness across those three years,
[SPEAKER_05]: what I want you to notice is it moves.
[SPEAKER_05]: In each year it's in a different position
and arrow points to the point in winter
[SPEAKER_05]: when it was at max.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that that arrow moves as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the other two varieties now
in comparison, you can see if you
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype for this trait in a warm year,
there's no difference between these three
[SPEAKER_05]: species.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use a punctuated year, vinifera
suddenly looks sensitive and the two wild
[SPEAKER_05]: species look tolerant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you go to a very cold year,
you start seeing separation across all
[SPEAKER_05]: three species.
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes it really challenging to study
from the point of view because so much of
[SPEAKER_05]: the phenotype is derived from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the type of winter is determining the
cold hardiness in any given year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing to note is that the buds
don't automatically super cool or gain the
[SPEAKER_05]: maximum amount of freeze hardiness in
every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be pushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not an automatic on-off switch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still want to understand what the
genetic architecture of this trait is
[SPEAKER_05]: though because we need to provide tools to
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did the same thing as I did with the
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at 43 different riparias to see
if we could understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what the data looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 43 different curves through winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take all of that data and you load
it into some statistical modeling,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get a simplified version of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In blue is the least hardy riparia.
[SPEAKER_05]: In yellow is the most hardy riparia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's about five degrees of
tolerance difference in those two
[SPEAKER_05]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other 41 accessions are somewhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the interesting thing here is if you
ask the statistical model, is there
[SPEAKER_05]: significant differences between the most
and least cold hardy, there is in this
[SPEAKER_05]: five degree parameter, but not in the
shape of the curve.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that at any one point in the
winter, the least hardy and the most hardy
[SPEAKER_05]: are responding to temperature perception
in the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gaining relatively amount,
the same relative amount of their
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype both down and up in response to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not really, we're not really
seeing a difference here in a cold
[SPEAKER_05]: hardiness trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a difference in something
that happens before we start this
[SPEAKER_05]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We start this experiment as soon as the
leaves fall in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we think is going on is that the time
that these vines are shutting down is the
[SPEAKER_05]: time that they start tracking temperature
and they're able to take advantage of hues
[SPEAKER_05]: telling them to go cold hardy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I use the analogy of starting on a
track race where some runners start out
[SPEAKER_05]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of them all looping around and
doing the same distance, imagine it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: a straight line.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whoever starts winter first has the
greatest potential for cold hardiness in
[SPEAKER_05]: that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we run the model backwards,
so now we're just guessing at what's going
[SPEAKER_05]: on, we see about a two week difference in
when we think these vines are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: sleep in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're starting to turn our eyes
away from this particular part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: trait and more towards this part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing I wanna bring up here is an
interesting observation that has come out
[SPEAKER_05]: of viticulture literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you spray a vine with ABA when the
fruit is setting, you can actually induce
[SPEAKER_05]: cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting thing you do is you
induce it in a parallel fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you spray a variety with ABA,
it goes dormant a little bit earlier and
[SPEAKER_05]: it gains cold hardiness throughout the
winter in a parallel fashion, much like
[SPEAKER_05]: we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this might be some evidence that this
early acclimation, early dormancy is what
[SPEAKER_05]: we really need to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a genetics point of view and a
genetic mapping point of view,
[SPEAKER_05]: the question is how do you work with this
trait?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's an unwieldy crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly influenced by the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we make crosses, because the winters
are severe here, we're always crossing
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of a moderately cold hardy by a very
cold hardy, so our phenotypic separation
[SPEAKER_05]: is really bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really wanna be making this cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way that we've approached it in my
group, because I can't grow sensitive
[SPEAKER_05]: vines here, they'll die every year,
is to break it down into bits.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we just focus on the acclimation,
we wanna understand how do cold events
[SPEAKER_05]: trigger gains of cold hardiness?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things that we know, colder winters
give you more hardiness, so colder
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures should give you more
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanna know if all temperatures trigger
acclimation in the same way and if we can
[SPEAKER_05]: develop any new phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you do this as a thought experiment,
if you take dormant cuttings from the
[SPEAKER_05]: field and you put them into different
growth chambers and you give them
[SPEAKER_05]: different temperatures, you should see
differences in acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's pictured here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we just phenotype all in the
growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we look at what happens if we do that
with Chardonnay in this case, so this is
[SPEAKER_05]: Chardonnay in the field, this is
Chardonnay in the growth chamber at two
[SPEAKER_05]: and seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that although there's a separation
there in those best fit lines,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no actual difference between these
two responses.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at the temperature in this
first two data points, we see that in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field it was seven degrees Celsius on
average, so it should be like the yellow
[SPEAKER_05]: line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we see acclimation, so we're missing
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we look at what temperature looks
like in the field, here's the seven
[SPEAKER_05]: average.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually seeing a lot of movement
around that seven average.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it's the temperature swing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did the experiment, put them in a
growth chamber with an average seven with
[SPEAKER_05]: a five degree swing, just like outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the data in static temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the data in static versus cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all gained cold hardiness,
and this is a significant gain of cold
[SPEAKER_05]: hardiness, if you cycle the temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not paying attention to the
average temperature, but there's something
[SPEAKER_05]: about the lows and highs that is signaling
the divine to gain cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other neat thing that's here is the
two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is at two degrees Celsius,
and then we moved it into a cycling
[SPEAKER_05]: chamber, which means we actually moved it
into a warmer environment, because the
[SPEAKER_05]: mean is now seven, and it gained cold
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually blind to static
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: From this, we're able to come up with a
new parameter called sigma T.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically looking at the
fluctuations in temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we add that to the model,
we fix the acclimation problem here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they're missing in the Washington
model that we have here is that erratic
[SPEAKER_05]: high-low cycling.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Washington, it's much more constant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what we're doing is now that we
know how to actually make them acclimate,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're trying to look at the gene
expression profiles that are going on
[SPEAKER_05]: during this process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're collecting the tissues now,
because we finally sort of narrowed in on
[SPEAKER_05]: the two years at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be, I'll come back and talk in
a couple years, let you know how that
[SPEAKER_05]: goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other side of this is deacclimation,
and deacclimation is a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_05]: to understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, it's the response to vines to warm
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at, I bring up chilling hours
again, because as you gain chilling hours,
[SPEAKER_05]: you gain faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gain faster growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we look at the bud burst phenotype
in a growth chamber, what we're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at is two things combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how fast it takes to grow,
but we're also looking at how much time it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes to lose cold hardiness to get to a
growth state, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's two parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at the number of days to lose
cold hardiness, we see this sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: That if you test at several different
temperatures, so you take cuttings,
[SPEAKER_05]: you put them in different growth chambers,
you measure how fast do they lose
[SPEAKER_05]: hardiness, we see a linear response at any
one temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a lot easier than the cycling.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at our, again, our curve,
and this box indicates the temperatures
[SPEAKER_05]: where chilling accumulates, if you go out
to the field and collect material
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout winter, at this point,
and you put it in a warm temperature and
[SPEAKER_05]: you try to deacclimate, it won't
deacclimate, it will not lose cold
[SPEAKER_05]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you go through winter, that changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The longer winter goes, the more chilling
that goes, the deacclimation becomes
[SPEAKER_05]: faster at that given temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we're seeing is this
relationship between chill accumulation
[SPEAKER_05]: and deacclimation speed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas you are always capable of
deacclimating, but in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're really, really slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason we're using planes is
because I don't have a mathematical mind
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have to work with cartoons to
understand this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically at the beginning of winter,
deacclimation is like a plane taxing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's moving, but it's moving really,
really slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: As it gains chilling, it takes off,
and then it makes its maximum speed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we think is going on is these
sections represent those endodormancy
[SPEAKER_05]: transition and ecodormancy periods.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing to note about this is
while these are linear responses,
[SPEAKER_05]: the rate at low temperature is lower than
the rate at high temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're deacclimating at a low
temperature, you're deacclimating at a
[SPEAKER_05]: lower optimal rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So full speed depends on the airplane.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rate of deacclimation depends on the
temperature you're deacclimating at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we look at Cabernet Sauvignon and
you deacclimate it at 10 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_05]: as chilling accumulates, you can see this
response.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll lose about half a degree of
hardiness per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you deacclimate it at 22 degrees
Celsius, it'll lose one and a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a linear relationship based on
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other interesting thing is if you look
at cultivar differences, re-sling,
[SPEAKER_05]: deacclimates a little bit faster at 10 C
and a lot faster at 22 C.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on this profile will give you
an idea of how fast you'll break in the
[SPEAKER_05]: spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a reflection of how you're responding
to warming temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we take those parameters, now
cultivar-specific deacclimation
[SPEAKER_05]: parameters, and plug them into the model,
we fix the tail end of the model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've captured the two portions of this
response that are unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not unique to the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see it in the Northeast because our
temperatures are more variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I want to show you is how
this compares to other species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's Cabernet Sauvignon again,
10 and 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Riesling.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at Vitis amurensis,
so this is the wild species they use for
[SPEAKER_05]: cold hardy breeding in Asia, it
deacclimates at 10 C at the same rate as
[SPEAKER_05]: Cab Sauv does at 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredibly timed.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as there's the slightest bit
warming, it gets ready to break bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a serious problem if you include
this trait in a hybrid in an area like New
[SPEAKER_05]: York.
[SPEAKER_05]: At 22 C, it's off the charts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhyperia, which is our favorite cold hardy
species in North America, is also faster
[SPEAKER_05]: than Riesling and Cab Sauv.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as fast as Vitis amurensis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at it at 22 C,
it catches up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the relative differences between these
species, it's really interesting,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, to see that there are different
components of this phenotype itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we learned from this, from a genetic
mapping kind of approach, is that we now
[SPEAKER_05]: have a phenotype that we can look at if
we're trying to select for increased
[SPEAKER_05]: responsiveness of temperature or decreased
responsiveness of temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically here, we want decreased response
so that we don't have early bud burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for table grapes in Southern
California, they want deacclimation at
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really rapid deacclimation because
they don't have long winters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we now know we want a phenotype at
around 1,500 hours of chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also see that northern species are
bringing along, along with cold hardness,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're bringing along this rapid
deacclimation phenotype that we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really want.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I have to somehow break those two
things apart if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: How this bears out when you look at data,
so now this is the same data I showed you
[SPEAKER_05]: before, but now I color coded it to match
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see, based on the
responsiveness of Amurensis at 10 C,
[SPEAKER_05]: why we have so much loss in midwinter in
Amurensis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't see the same loss in Viparia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the season, when
chilling has maximized, we're starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: warm up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We start to see the same levels of
deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it starts to make sense with the field
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So another cool observation that comes out
of this is looking at these three
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Cab Franc and Sauvignon Blanc,
and Cab Sauvignon, Cabernet Sauvignon,
[SPEAKER_05]: are three varieties that happen to have
this pedigree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cab Franc and Sauvignon Blanc are the
parents of Cab Sauv.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have sort of like a local small
breeding family to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at their response, here's
Sauvignon Blanc at 10 and 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Cab Franc at 10 and 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's Cab Sauv at 10 and 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's neat about this is it tells us
that we really want to be perhaps
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotyping at this warm temperature,
because we can exaggerate the differences
[SPEAKER_05]: between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then comparing it with a colder
temperature may give us a better idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: what they're doing at different stages.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we could be selecting for different
aspects of this trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing we're doing with
deacclimation is the same thing I
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned in acclimation is that we're
collecting data on gene expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as the bind is deacclimating,
we collect bud tissue and do RNA-seq on
[SPEAKER_05]: those samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this on four different varieties,
Riesling, Cab Sauv, Amurensis,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Riperia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a heat map, which it looks
really washed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure you've seen heat maps from
gene expression before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, if we look at how time affects
us, we have a major group of genes that
[SPEAKER_05]: are upregulated during deacclimation and a
major group of genes that are
[SPEAKER_05]: downregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we do pathway enrichment,
like how many genes are in different
[SPEAKER_05]: pathways?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any overrepresented pathways?
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing that popped out repeatedly
in all four varieties is the ABA pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in the ABA pathway, we have
carotidinoid biosynthesis leading to
[SPEAKER_05]: Xanthoxin leading to ABA.
[SPEAKER_05]: ABA can then be degraded, signal,
or be put in an activation-reactivation
[SPEAKER_05]: pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at how gene expression
occurs each day during deacclimation,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's what these squares are,
you can see that biosynthesis is shut
[SPEAKER_05]: down, conversion is shut down,
degradation is shut down, signaling is
[SPEAKER_05]: shut down, and the inactive pool is the
only thing that is sort of being
[SPEAKER_05]: upregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of like the bind or the bud
is purging ABA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this makes sense from what we know
about the antagonistic aspects of ABA and
[SPEAKER_05]: GA.
[SPEAKER_05]: ABA represses GA.
[SPEAKER_05]: GA is responsible for growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's happening during
deacclimation is a gradual conversion from
[SPEAKER_05]: no growth to growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we wanted to do from, and this is
by no means complete, this is just like
[SPEAKER_05]: the easiest nugget to show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've done though is we've taken this
result and we've moved it into trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: translate this into a viticulture method
for growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we did is we looked at the
effectiveness of ABA on the phenotype of
[SPEAKER_05]: deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at the normal deacclimation
pattern here in yellow, you can see over
[SPEAKER_05]: time you lose cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you spray the buds with an ABA spray,
you can stop deacclimation and shift the
[SPEAKER_05]: bud break phenotype by quite a distance
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 30 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at what that looks like from
the gross plant look, here on the left is
[SPEAKER_05]: control Here's one millimolar ABA,
five millimolar ABA.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that there's a clear
suppression of growth and a clear delay
[SPEAKER_05]: relative to control.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that we're doing is
comparing this to methyl jasminate,
[SPEAKER_05]: another stress responsive hormone to see
if we could trigger similar pathways with
[SPEAKER_05]: a different plant hormone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see here in five millimolar methyl
jasminate and 2.5 millimolar methyl
[SPEAKER_05]: jasminate that we're getting some of the
same phenotype, but it's not as extreme as
[SPEAKER_05]: ABA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've hope we've dissected the
different aspects of cold hardness apart
[SPEAKER_05]: with the goal of trying to come up with
genes that are important, but then also
[SPEAKER_05]: give growers maybe a field mitigation
method should we have warm events in late
[SPEAKER_05]: winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to wrap all of this up,
dormancy, acclimation, maintenance of cold
[SPEAKER_05]: hardness and deacclimation are a suite of
physiological and genetic traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all very complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Temperature perception is clearly playing
a major role.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the temperature sensor
is in the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of actively growing
tissue, but something is keeping track of
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Acclimation is far more complicated than
just perceiving an average temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just colder, gives you more
acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's colder and variable temperature
swings that gives you acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deacclimation and chilling requirement,
they appear to be adaptive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we seem to have a really nice
phenotype now for deploying to mapping
[SPEAKER_05]: studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the problems with grapes is that
we don't have, if you make a mapping
[SPEAKER_05]: family, you don't have a lot of space for
your plants and you don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue from any one individual.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this might give us a way to finally
start phenotyping because we've narrowed
[SPEAKER_05]: in on something that actually changes in a
consistent way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, epsizic acid metabolism seems
to play an essential role both in the
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimation as I showed you if you spray
with ABA they gain hardiness, but also in
[SPEAKER_05]: deacclimation that if you supply ABA you
can halt the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that was a lot, but I will just
say thank you for giving me a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk and then open it up to any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you been able to, I mean with
raparia, is there enough variation out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the natural ones that you could
actually in these cold winters go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and score depth and essentially do a
natural association mapping design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you go through after a hard
winter, you figure out which ones died and
[SPEAKER_00]: you find 10, $5,000 of them, something
like that, go through woods and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype the live and dead ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that doable?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the question was could we
basically do a natural selection study,
[SPEAKER_05]: collect a vast amount of variable
genotypes for raparia, plant them all out,
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully kill a good chunk of them,
and then just look for the genetic regions
[SPEAKER_05]: that are shared amongst them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure you need to plant them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you walk through the woods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you score the depth of raparia in the
woods?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem we see with the riparias,
so all of those riparias survive here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether they come from Texas or they come
from Manitoba, they survive here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, and I showed you in the very cold
year, we can start pushing things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: cold hardy apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your study design might work better if you
were to take a whole diversity panel and
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in Manitoba, right, where we really
push up against the adaptive barrier that
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 degrees, or the 40 degree C line.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need that kind of winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: The kind of winters we have just make
things messy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't normally see any damage in
riparia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see it in vinifera, but again it
depends on the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some years we have significant vinifera
damage at what would be considered warm
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures because it was a very mild
winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just, it's really sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think you could do it in principle.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put it someplace where you pushed.
Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great talk, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in genomic predation people are trying
to integrate crop growth models with
[SPEAKER_02]: predation for things like yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it depends on having a very simplified
crop growth model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you only have a few parameters that you
think are under genetic control and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you push those through a crop growth
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean I guess you showed the various
graphs where you're trying to match
[SPEAKER_02]: exclamation into the exclamation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In essence you're developing a winter
hardiness model through your different
[SPEAKER_02]: phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean do you think you could simplify it
or is it already simplified down to three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, maybe five parameters that each,
you essentially try to give each genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have in succession a value for
three or four parameters and then push it
[SPEAKER_02]: through that model?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way the Keller model was developed
is similar to what you're saying in that
[SPEAKER_05]: for each cultivar you have a set of
parameters that you just plug and chug
[SPEAKER_05]: given your weather data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just send it through.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the data that I presented,
we only have it for two varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is stuff that's come out of Al's
project.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the end goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's connecting those two pieces,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we have temperature playing a
different role in each section.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all related to the chill
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hope would be that we'd be able to
have like a parameter that ties to
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimation, a parameter that is measuring
the chill accumulation which is fairly
[SPEAKER_05]: standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the temperature range.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the rates of the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you string those together,
you should get the curve based on any
[SPEAKER_05]: given year, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's gonna be dependent on
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working towards that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we know that it works and it's
worth the effort, it's actually a fairly
[SPEAKER_05]: simple experiment to go out and do and to
collect all the material and then just
[SPEAKER_05]: make the measurements.
[SPEAKER_05]: The important part is to do the growth
chamber experiments in both cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the natural variation,
there's too much other stuff going on
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't show here, there's other
aspects of like when the sun is out,
[SPEAKER_05]: the buds are actually warmer than air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: At night, the buds drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's below air temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all these other environmental
parameters that we need to narrow things
[SPEAKER_05]: in the growth chamber in order to
understand how to incorporate them for the
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the riparia stuff, we haven't done
the controlled like deacclimation studies
[SPEAKER_05]: at different temperatures to get the rates
for every variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have it for that one that I showed
in that graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where we're gonna go next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all of the stuff I started with
was using these older cold hardiness
[SPEAKER_05]: curves and bud burst assays.
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, the new methods are a lot
tighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're gonna redo that so that we
can actually use those parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more, then you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_05]: The acclimation side of things from the
comparisons I've done for past stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: they look like they acclimate roughly at
the same rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may be that there's more of a,
it's a more constant response to
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature on that side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That part of the physiology may be more
standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: The deacclimation may be the wiggly part.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rapid acclimation, right now we're
faced with trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature with certain amplitude gives
you certain hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that actually gets tricky because as
you go down and temperature gets harder
[SPEAKER_05]: and harder to actually simulate that
winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how far we'll get to
figuring out if we can get rapid
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimators.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the hope would be get something that
goes down and each year gets you your
[SPEAKER_05]: maximum hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means going to sleep early and
then your maximum resistance to
[SPEAKER_05]: deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be the best way forward
because we're not gonna be able to control
[SPEAKER_05]: winters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every now and then we're gonna have a
winter that kills them because it's mild
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we get a polar vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really think there's anything we
can do to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just give you the best tools for
each year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you add a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody has done a good job of showing that
that's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the root stock could impact cold
hardiness from maybe some other ways by
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling vine vigor or by controlling
sort of like the crop load contributing to
[SPEAKER_05]: a greater or lesser crop load.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that may have a source sink
relationship with bud cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Martinson is the extension,
a bit of a culturist at Cornell and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: doing a study right now with the idea of
testing the source sink idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you dramatically reduce sink or you
dramatically reduce sources, can you
[SPEAKER_05]: influence bud cold hardiness?
[SPEAKER_05]: No one has shown that a given root stock
will improve the cold hardiness of
[SPEAKER_05]: Riesling by X.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really I don't know if that's
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the bud itself is sort of isolated
from the root.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the dormancy process and the
hardiness process is sealing itself off
[SPEAKER_05]: from the cane so that ice can't propagate
into the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so signals and that kind of stuff that
might be coming from the root are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be difficult to transmit into the bud
outside of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no one's done a good systematic
job of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was with riparia data,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would have to look to see what the
projected dormancy target would be for a
[SPEAKER_05]: bonifera, to see how close that would push
up against harvest date.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with riparia, we don't even look at
yield because we just don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at it more from the
hardiness point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they do the studies with ABA and they
spray the vines at brazen, which is when
[SPEAKER_05]: the berries start to turn purple,
it's sort of mid-season, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: they see the effect in the fall with
yellowing of leaves, early leaf drop,
[SPEAKER_05]: early entrance into dormancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also ripens the berries faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the ABA ripens the berries faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may be possible to select for yields
like earlier ripening phenotype in tandem
[SPEAKER_02]: with a... Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so yeah, so your question is would
speeding up entrance into dormancy impact
[SPEAKER_05]: the subsequent year's harvest?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much... I guess that's a
great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the right answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we would talk to like a fruit load
physiologist, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much those late season
leaves are contributing to the
[SPEAKER_05]: photosynthate storage, where if you were
to knock them off a couple of weeks early,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you would... I don't think you would
impact inflorescence number because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're already patterned in the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know the right answer to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we figure out the first part,
then we'll go after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, let's thank... This has been
a production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_05]: web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
