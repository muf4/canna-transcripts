[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pleased to introduce today's
speaker, Stefan Ventalila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I go through the formal
introduction, though, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce some work that he did in my lab
earlier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stefan actually came to Cornell to work
in the Tanksley lab, where he stayed for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he came to my lab to work on the
project I'm about to describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: To explain what he did, I have to explain
how I got tenure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this slide explains what I did
during my assistant professorship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he came to my lab right after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were interested in this question of
cytoplasmic male sterility and nuclear
[SPEAKER_01]: encoded fertility restoration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the reproductive isolation
methods that plants use.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I was an assistant professor
We didn't actually know what cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_01]: genome was encoding this trait of
cytoplasmic male sterility, whether it was
[SPEAKER_01]: chloroplast or mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what gene was doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also didn't know anything about
this nuclear encoded fertility restoration
[SPEAKER_01]: gene that could restore the pollen
development to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what my lab did was look in petunia to
try to find the gene that was encoding
[SPEAKER_01]: cytoplasmic male sterility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a fertile line with the
recessive allele of the RF gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a recessive allele with the
CMS cytoplasm, it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the lack of pollen development
in the middle one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have one copy of the
fertility restore, you get a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found was that there was a
toxic protein encoded by an abnormal gene
[SPEAKER_01]: in mitochondrial DNA in that sterile
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the RF allele prevents the expression
of this toxic protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I got tenure was that
finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when I came here and Stefan
joined the lab, we wanted to find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: the RF gene was.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, we didn't know what RF genes
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Stefan did was an amazing effort
to try to identify that RF gene in
[SPEAKER_01]: petunia, which is our model system.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, there was no genome for
petunia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no high throughput sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were almost no genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stefan had to develop those all from
scratch, including a buyback library,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after an effort that took three
successive two-year USDA grants,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was able to figure out what the RF gene
encoded.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found that it encoded a
pentatrichopeptide repeat protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the founding member of this
protein family for these restorers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's now known that most restore genes
in plants are so-called PPR proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be hearing more about them
in today's seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in organelles, it's a small world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these proteins are now known to be a
large family when they bind proteins that
[SPEAKER_01]: control organelle gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this protein turns off the expression
of that toxic gene and that toxic protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stefan then moved from working on this
petunia RF project to working on RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he's going to describe
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stefan got his bachelor's degree in
biochemistry at the University of Science
[SPEAKER_01]: and Technology in Montpellier,
France, and an MS degree in agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: science at the agronomy school in
Toulouse, and then a PhD in molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics at Universit√© Claude-Bernard-Leon
in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, he came to Tanksley's lab
first, then my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's recently been promoted to be a
research scientist in the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular Biology and Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Maureen, for this very nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I have my little tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell you today about
unraveling the complexity of plant RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: editing machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the first slide, I just an overview
of my talk with a little background about
[SPEAKER_00]: what plant RNA editing is, and then how we
identify some of the components of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's editosome, which is the molecular
machinery responsible for this
[SPEAKER_00]: modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the three different approach,
genetics, biochemistry approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what I call homology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will illustrate what I mean by that
during the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last part of my talk,
I'll tell you about new editing factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have not been published yet,
and the future direction that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take my research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not because I'm not using the
right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNA editing is a common theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one type of RNA processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it occurs in many, many species under
very different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens in virus, trypanosome,
squid, plant, which is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of my talk today, and even as a
human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a plant, it's a post transcriptional
modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some transcripts here, they are cited in
being modified to a uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is restricted to only the
organelle genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the arabidopsis is the plant
model I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the chloroplast, about 40 Cs are
modified to a uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in mitochondria, it's the same
phenomenon, except it's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 600 Cs are modified to a uredine in
the mitochondrial genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reaction that is responsible for
this is a deamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the amino acid here in the citidine
is replaced by a keto group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus, the citidine is modified to a
uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very often, people are wondering why
plants edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in plants, in the plant world,
this is a corrective mechanism that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to have a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the amino acid after editing is
actually encoded in a more conserved amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it can create start or stop
codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I give you an example of a
plastic transcript and the HD,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the start codon in the ACG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a start codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon editing, the C is modified to a
uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus, a start codon is created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows, of course, the protein to
be translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important mechanism for
plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no editing or start codon will
start codon, no protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the loss of editing really results
in many different and various phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where it occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this example, this is an
editing mutant, which is unable to edit a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific C on the transcript that encodes
the plastic RNA polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, this mutant, you can see,
is virulent and is not autotroph and has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on a sucrose medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our favorite mutant in the lab,
so this mutant plant is unable to edit a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific C on the ACG plastic transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's no abuse
phenotype associated with this defect in
[SPEAKER_00]: editing compared to the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I give another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a mitochondrial mutant in
editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little plant is unable to edit two
Cs on transcript that encodes a small
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosomal protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, there's a translational
defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plant shows, obviously,
a slow-growth phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the defect in editing occurs
in very important position in the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential gene, it's embryo lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not able to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you in the introduction that not
all the Cs are edited to uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 40 Cs are edited in the plastic and
around 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely not all the Cs are edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this specificity is really
dependent upon two elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, there's a C element, which is a
small ribonucleotide sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is upstream of the Cs to be edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this little figure, I show that
these Cs don't have these C elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they won't be edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: These C possess these C elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it will be modified to a uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's only a part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other, obviously, is a trans factor
that's going to recognize the C element,
[SPEAKER_00]: binds to the C element, and then process
the C and modify it to a uredine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this complicated slide that was
done some time ago by a postdoc in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, Charles, this slide showed that this
trans factor that we call plant editosome
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually a small protein complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Charles did, he extracts protein
from chloroplast and then size
[SPEAKER_00]: fractionated them on the size exclusion
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is all the fraction from the
big one to the small one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he assay each fraction for
editing activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to go into detail into
the assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, for you to understand,
is that these bands, the more intense
[SPEAKER_00]: these bands and the more active for
editing is the fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this band, the number 13,
is where the band is the most intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is just a quantification of this
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this band, again, is comprised between
200 and 400 kilodalton, thus demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: that this plant editosome is a small
protein complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the game in the lab was trying to
find the components of this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: editosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm a geneticist, at that time
I was working on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On CMS, but I also developed this as a
side project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are different assayations of
Arabidopsis, short from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point of this slide is just to
show you how diverse these plants are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the size and morphology of their rosette
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at this plant, I thought
that maybe also they were differing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they edit their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, that was a good guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I won't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with a previous, that was years
ago, over 10 years ago, with a postdoc in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab, Anne-Laure Chatenier,
we studied this particular transcript,
[SPEAKER_00]: CCB206, which is called also CCNB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested and we focused on
this transcript because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript that possessed the highest
number of edited seeds, that's about 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one experiment, we could potentially
look for a difference between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: widely used assayations, Landsberg and
Columbia, at 40 position along the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is an electrophoretogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this position,
the Columbia, is more edited than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Erechta because the T peak is higher in
Columbia than it is in the Landsberg
[SPEAKER_00]: Erechta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have a difference in parental
assayation, that's almost the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: story, not really, but in Arabidopsis
because then you can use many genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people have crossed these two,
these two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can use the progeny to study
the segregation of these differential
[SPEAKER_00]: extent in the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'll just show you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that one of the gene
controlling this differential editing
[SPEAKER_00]: extent was actually in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is on chromosome two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with Walter Knight, who was an
undergrad doing honor thesis with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Walter did, he screened many,
many hundreds of progeny coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross between Landsberg and Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are these progeny, these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are recombinant because they have
inherited part of their genome from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try so to shake, from
Landsberg in blue and part from Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what Walter did, he assay the
editing extent of all these progeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: these recombinant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, if they were edited like
Columbia, they were red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Erechta, blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's an easy regression of the
phenotype and the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to look at matching colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the matching colors are just between
these two recombination points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, there was only one gene that we
call REM1 for required for efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty convinced because there
was only one gene that was the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene, again, is a PPR,
as Maureen told you in the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restoration of fertility is also a
PPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPR because pentatrichopeptid repeat,
that's the only term I'm going to tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed by repeat, which are 35
amino acid long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, this protein contains
some extra motif of the C-terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to demonstrate that this
gene was really, this protein was an
[SPEAKER_00]: editing factor, we looked at a mutant,
a tDNA insertional mutant, and we found
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compared the level of editing
extent in the homozygous mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the tDNA, which disrupt the
expression of this gene, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there was a significant
difference in the level of editing extent
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, demonstrating that REM1 was really
the editing factor recognizing this
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that illustrates the genetic approach,
which was pretty cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, so we're going to build up the
model as a puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these PPR protein, and I don't have
time to show you the evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are the one that are the
recognition factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recognize the C element and bind to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are found both in the chloroplast
and in the mitochondrial site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are other component, because I
told you at the very beginning that we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that this editosome is about 200 and
400 kilodalton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size of the PPR is way below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that there were other
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way we decided to chase these
components, and that's a work that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: in collaboration with Wade Heller,
who used to be a BCMB student in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Wade did, he put a flag on one of
our favorite PPR recognition factor called
[SPEAKER_00]: REM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using antibody against this REM1,
he was able to immunoprecipitate the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the collaboration with the
Van Wink lab, we were able to identify one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the components of this complex as being
REAP1 for RNA editing factor interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: protein 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because this REAP1 was a member of
this complex, obviously we wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it was also an editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as usual, we looked at tDNA
mutants, and we found two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One which was in this entron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I told you before, obviously this
protein, this gene is an essential gene
[SPEAKER_00]: because we were unable to recover
homozygous mutants for this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily for us, we had also tDNA
inserted in the promoter, and we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to recover homozygous mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this plant is very
effective in its development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by using bulk sequencing,
we analyzed all the editome, meaning all
[SPEAKER_00]: the edited Cs in the chloroplast,
the plastid, and in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that this mutant was
affected in about a third of these plastid
[SPEAKER_00]: editing site, meaning that the level of
editing in the mutant for this site was
[SPEAKER_00]: much reduced compared to the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, about 3 quarter of
the site in the mitochondria were
[SPEAKER_00]: affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 100 was really the level of
editing was not even detectable by bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a very exciting result
because it was the first time that a
[SPEAKER_00]: component of this plant editosome was not
a PPR protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: RIP1 is not a PPR protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we wanted to know because the PPR,
I told you, binds, recognize and bind the
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were wondering how the specificity
work for RIP1 towards its targets because
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't affect all the Cs, many Cs,
but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a work that was done by Tao.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tao Sun was a previous plant bio grad
student working in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Tao showed by using East2Hybrid
that actually the recognition of RIP1 for
[SPEAKER_00]: its target was mediated through its
interaction with the recognition factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to make you understand
what I just said, I have this little
[SPEAKER_00]: animation where here you can see that in
the chloroplast Tao showed that RIP1
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with RIP1, it also interacts
with another recognition factor called
[SPEAKER_00]: CR28.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not responsible for all this name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then RIP1 doesn't interact with CR21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the mutant, RIP1 is not there
anymore or is very reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only the sites for which RIP1
interacts with the recognition factor are
[SPEAKER_00]: affected in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sites for which RIP1 doesn't interact
with the recognition factor don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: their editing level affected in the
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's true in the chloroplast is true
also in the plastid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tao showed also that RIP1 was able to
homodimerize by East2Hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all the story that the second
part was to illustrate the biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: approach in order to identify components
of the plant's editosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to tell you about the
homology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is that RIP1 is a
member of a small family of protein in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nine members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RIP1, which we found was involved in
mitochondria and plastid editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I identify them by using software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this block, we call it the RIP motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a homology block.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know really what the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they are important because they
are conserved in the RIP family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we were wondering,
are any of these other proteins also
[SPEAKER_00]: editing factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, instead of using bulk
sequencing, I developed a method based on
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation sequencing to analyze
mutant or silent tissue from this other
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so briefly, it's a very easy method
where I use a specific primer for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: organelle genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some RNA are edited more than other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these things are cDNA,
whether you would transform in T.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I shear the cDNA and use these
shear fragments to build up Illumina
[SPEAKER_00]: library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just align these reads on the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just count, really,
the number of red being T or blue being C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ratio of red to blue gives me a
very accurate measure of the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a collaboration that I did with
Robert Bukowski, who's a bioinformatician
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used this method to analyze the
mutant and the silent tissue in this other
[SPEAKER_00]: member.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that RIP2 and RIP9 were
plastic editing factor, while RIP3 and
[SPEAKER_00]: RIP8 were mitochondrial editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, using this motif to integrate
the database, I found that there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: weird protein that we called OM1 for
organelle RNA recognition motif containing
[SPEAKER_00]: protein 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a weird one because it has a
duplicated RIP domain, which is also
[SPEAKER_00]: truncated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that some of the blocks are
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, it has a motif at the c
terminus, which is called an RN for RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were, of course, interested to
know whether this OM1 also was an editing
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as usual, we looked at the tDNA
mutant in the first exon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that this plant is
really morphologically OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we surveyed the editum,
we found that the mitochondrial editum was
[SPEAKER_00]: not affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the platyletum was affected in this
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 2 thirds of the editing site
were reduced in the mutant, with 12 sites
[SPEAKER_00]: which had a major loss of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we were interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you, I don't know if you
remember, but this protein here has two
[SPEAKER_00]: parts, a RIP-RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we identified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the RN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were curious to know which part is
important for the editing ability of this
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's work that was done by
Tao.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I show the 12 sites that are
severely reduced in their editing stand in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue bar is the level of editing in
the wild type, but very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the mutant, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Tao did was to transiently
transform protoplasm for the mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: first with the RIP-RIP domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he did that, nothing really
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he did the same experiment with
the RN, he was able to complement most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the site, at least partially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the end to our surprise,
actually, because we were expecting more
[SPEAKER_00]: the RIP-RIP to be involved in editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's how we identified this
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, to our surprise,
it's the RN part of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was responsible for the editing
ability of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as for RIP-1, Tao, using these
two hybrids, studied how this OM1 was
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing its target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same story as for OM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recognition is mediated through its
interaction with a known recognition
[SPEAKER_00]: factor, which are PPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, in the mutant, when OM1 goes
down, only the sites for which OM1
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with the PPR see their editing
extent go down in the mutant, not this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, OM1 doesn't interact with
rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Tao showed that OM1 was
interacting with other known editing
[SPEAKER_00]: factor from the RIP family, RIP-1 and
RIP-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, we just add other parts in the
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RIP members, the OM1 for the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I put OM1 touching the RNA in this
model, it's because with collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Barkham lab, I've shown that this
OM1 has some specificity for the RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a gel shift assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this is one of the targets
of OM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a nice shift compared to a
non-target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this now, we have a new student,
Andrew, in the lab, who's going to study
[SPEAKER_00]: more deeply the recognition and the
binding of OM1 for its RNA target.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the mito?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the finding of this RN being
involved in editing opened a new whole
[SPEAKER_00]: area for us to explore, because the RN is
a very frequent motif in the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Arabidopsis, there's about 200
proteins that contain this RN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could use brute force and test
these 200 proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to be smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was a phylogenetic
analysis based on the RN motif of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these proteins in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this RN motif is about 80 amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we observed was OM1, this new
editing factor, was part of this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: clade containing about 20 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, the question then was,
are these also potential editing factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a grant with Maureen that just
ended up for which Maureen was the main PI
[SPEAKER_00]: and was the co-PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily for us, we just got a new
grant for which now I'm the PI and Maureen
[SPEAKER_00]: is the co-PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, now I'm going to show you the
work from Xiaowen, who was a grad student
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab and who just finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she studied this clade of OM
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another way to represent all
these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the funding father is OM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the RIP domain, this RM,
and all the other protein which belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: this clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do because the RM found in this
other OM are very similar to the RM found
[SPEAKER_00]: in OM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Xiaowen shown during her PhD
was that OM2, OM3, and OM4 were
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OM6 is a plastic editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OM6 has not been published yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that at the end of my
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these other members also
possess extra domain, glycine-rich domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm just going to show you an
example of Xiaowen work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to demonstrate that OM3 was a
mitochondrial editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked at the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she got a mutant in this exon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she compared the level of editing
in mitochondrial site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this OM3 is involved in the
control of editing of 20% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial site overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 100 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, I'll just show only two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the level of editing extent in
the wild type, in green, and in magenta,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a very significant
difference level of editing extent between
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild type and the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true for this other site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what Xiaowen did was to complement
these mutants by putting functional OM3
[SPEAKER_00]: under the control of 35% as promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that she was able to
restore the level of editing and increase
[SPEAKER_00]: it very significantly when compared to the
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of editing goes from around 40%
for this site to about 85% to 90% in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were wondering, I told you
that for OM1, what was important was the
[SPEAKER_00]: RM motif and not the reprip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OM3 has two motif as the RM and the
glycine-rich domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, of course, were wondering
whether it was the same story as for OM1,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it was the RM domain or the
glycine-rich domain that was important for
[SPEAKER_00]: the editing ability of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Xiaowen did was to,
again, so here's the mutant for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's low-edited, about 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Xiaowen put the whole full-length
OM3, she's able to restore the editing
[SPEAKER_00]: level to 45%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she used only the RM,
again, she's able to significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the level of editing extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, again, demonstrating that what's
important for the editing ability of this
[SPEAKER_00]: protein is the RM motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as usual, she was interested to
know whether these new editing factors was
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the editosome and was interacting
with other non-editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'll just show you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used BiFC for B-molecular fluorescence
complementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she put half a fluorophore on each
part of the protein that she wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: study the interaction on three,
in this case, RIP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they interact, then it will bring
the two parts close enough so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to fluoresce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then she did that in Nicosiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a negative control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, in red, are the
autofluorescence from the chloroplast,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a close-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this nice spot
fluorescence when she did this experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrating that OM3 and RIP1 can
interact in planta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, what's true for a protein for
chloroplast is true also for mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have PPR, you have RIP,
and you have also OM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's still an interrogation
mark here, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a work done again by Tao.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used the same strategy as Wade did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he put a flag on the OM1 and
immunoprecipitated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, again, with a collaboration with
the class van Wyk, we determined by mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometry that one of these proteins
that was pulled down with OM1 was OZ1.
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ1 for organelle zinc finger 1,
because this protein contained a zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: finger motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because OZ1 was immunoprecipitated
with OM1, again, we were wondering whether
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ1 was an editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as usual, we looked at the tDNA
insertional mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, unlike OM1, this mutant is
not very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mutant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's albino, it's small, and it has to
be grown on sucrose medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the abitum of this
mutant, what we found is that the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plastid editing site were affected
in this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this OZ1 was identified
through its interaction with OM1,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were wondering whether there was
overlap in the site under the control of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two editing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, actually the majority of the
site, 21, see their editing sense severely
[SPEAKER_00]: affected in both the OM1 and the OZ1
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OZ1 belongs to a small family of
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a little diagram of how
they look like with the homology block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only really known motif is,
as I told before, is a zinc finger motif
[SPEAKER_00]: in this light blue turquoise.
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ1 possesses two of these zinc finger
motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, OZ1.
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ2 has two.
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ3 has three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OZ4 has four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the obvious question
to ask, because it works for REAP,
[SPEAKER_00]: it works for OM, are these other members
also editing factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, I hope I convinced you that the
plant's editosome are complex protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: small but complex, which contain several
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also, they contain the same
protein in both the mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_00]: editosome and the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPR, which are the recognition factor that
bind to the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: REAP, OM, and OZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: OZ has been just demonstrated in the
chloroplast editosome, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, in the last part of my talk,
I'm going to tell you about a new plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: editing factor, OM6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OM6, actually, from the start,
we had a strong presumption that this was
[SPEAKER_00]: also an editing factor, because the RM
found in this protein is the most similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to OM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what we did was to study editing
mutant, sorry, mutant, tDNA, insertional
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we used STSPCR-Seq, this next
generation-based approach to study the
[SPEAKER_00]: editome of these mutants, we found that
there was no mitochondrial editing defect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was plastic editing defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here in green is a level of
editing extent in the wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: in magenta, in the mutant for this
particular protein, OM6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's a strong
reduction of editing extent for this site,
[SPEAKER_00]: ACCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 100%, it goes to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more pronounced for this site,
PSBF77, for which the editing goes from
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% to 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, just to show you that it's not
affecting this other site, for which
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the same level of editing extent
in the wild type and in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is another way to represent the
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference reported to the value
of the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the site that
experienced the most drastic reduction is
[SPEAKER_00]: this site on PSBF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these mutants show a slow-growth
phenotype and also a defect in their
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we were working on these
mutants, actually, we found out that
[SPEAKER_00]: another group was working on this mutant,
Yan Lu.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's a photosynthetic person,
so she did not use the same screen to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this weird fluorescent shows
that this mutant is affected in this
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Xiaowen showed that OM6 was part of
this plastic editosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: By studying its interaction with
non-editing factors by FC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I just show a few examples of
OM6 interacting with RIP1 here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: or with OZ1 here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I told you that mostly there's two
sites which are affected in the mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: ICCD and PSBF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a phenotype, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question was, which site is
responsible for the phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had strong presumption that it was
the PSBF defect in editing because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: a mutant in the lab which is affected in
the ICCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show you a picture at the very
beginning of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no phenotype associated with
these mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to demonstrate that the PSBF
defect in editing was responsible for this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, small growth, and
photosynthetic deficiency, what Yan did
[SPEAKER_00]: was a pretty cool experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took PSBF with a T genomically
encoded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she transformed a plant, the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here, it's translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in green is a transit peptide
that allows the protein to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this red meaning that this
protein is already edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by doing that, she was able to at
least partially complement the defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphological defect, where you can
see you have to trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though these transgenic plants
are not at the level of the wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are much better and much bigger than
the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also their photosynthetic efficiency,
even though it's not at the level of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type, is much better than the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in other words, demonstrating that
the defect of PSBF editing is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the morphological defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We observe in these mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, I hope that today I
convince you that the plant elitosome is
[SPEAKER_00]: complex and contain at least four protein
families for the plastid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PPR, which are the recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PPR, the REAPs, which are also called
Morse, the Orms, and the Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only three protein families have been
identified so far in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Editosome, and they are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PPR, the morph, or REAPs, and the
Orms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plant elitosome is really
diverse in its composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in the PPR that they contain,
because the PPR differ for every site,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are really the recognition
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in regards to these other
components, the Orm or the REAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, so today I told you
about two Orms, the Orm 1 and Orm 6,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are plastidizing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sites under the control are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two sites mostly affected by the Orm 6
mutant are not affected by the Orm 1
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, they are elitosome,
plastid elitosome that contain Orm 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other that contain Orm 6, depending on
which side they're going to modify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Orm 6 is a unusual Orm protein,
because it really recognize a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: number of targets, only really two,
mostly two.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all the other Orms be plastid,
or mitochondria, or really recognize and
[SPEAKER_00]: affect many, many, many sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
