[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Neil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate the opportunity to participate
in the Hortz seminar today and we're here
[SPEAKER_03]: to highlight some of the services that are
available through the library and to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you know that I'm the liaison to this
department and I'm essentially the go-to
[SPEAKER_03]: guy if you're not sure who to approach
within the library about something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully some of the things we're
going to be telling you today will get you
[SPEAKER_03]: to think about the library perhaps at
times or in ways that you haven't in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past and so we're just going to I'm going
to highlight a few different resources and
[SPEAKER_03]: projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly Passion one of my colleagues will be
talking a bit about library instruction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keith Jenkins another colleague will be
talking about geospatial information and
[SPEAKER_03]: services that we provide and then Sarah
Wright will be talking more about data
[SPEAKER_03]: services that we have data management that
we have within the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been around Mann Library for a
little while I know many of you in fact I
[SPEAKER_03]: know many of my colleagues in Geneva as
well since I was the librarian at Geneva
[SPEAKER_03]: for about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well some of you that may be the way you
think about the library and in fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: view may be a little bit fuzzy for you but
we still do do books though it's sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to fade away a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do many things in addition to
providing information resources and print
[SPEAKER_03]: form as well as in electronic forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things we do in the library
is we have public gallery space and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: that some of you have actually utilized
that in the past and that's available for
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty and students to do group
presentations or individual presentations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give you a sense of the space and some
of the different uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here on the right you see some of the
individual study rooms that you can sign
[SPEAKER_03]: out for a period of time if you need some
quiet space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The upper left you see that we have also
some presentation practice spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you as a student or anyone for that
matter need a space to practice that
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation we have a separate room for
that kind of thing or it can be used as a
[SPEAKER_03]: group study room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the lower left you can see some of
the collaborative space that we have
[SPEAKER_03]: created mostly on the second floor
increasingly classes as well as just
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals need to work together on
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see there where several
students can cluster around a single
[SPEAKER_03]: monitor to share work on a project.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a wide variety of seating
types or study space types for anybody to
[SPEAKER_03]: use in the library and this is also in the
Bissett collaborative space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see comfortable chairs you can see
sort of bar type stools you can see bean
[SPEAKER_03]: bags there's a wide variety of study
spaces and there you can get a sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: how they get used.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have this monitor in the in the
lobby space which is available for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote things that that you have an event
perhaps a new class that you're offering.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use that contact us and you can
get a slide and it cycles through the
[SPEAKER_03]: slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that many of you have seen that
and some of you have used that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another service that I want to point out
is the Copyright Information Center and
[SPEAKER_03]: again I'm just highlighting a few of the
services and projects that we have and
[SPEAKER_03]: this the Copyright Information Center is a
collaborative effort with the library the
[SPEAKER_03]: University Council the campus store and
CIT.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can bring any of your copyright
questions to this either by contacting
[SPEAKER_03]: using the contact form that's found on the
website or you can you can email them or
[SPEAKER_03]: just contact me and I can help you get
connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you may be wanting to publish a
chapter in a book or perhaps a whole book
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're wondering about whether or not
you can retain the copyright to that
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than turning it over to the
commercial publisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people in this group can advise you on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact we highly recommend that you
do retain your your copyright whenever
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been stories on campus of
faculty members who have published an
[SPEAKER_03]: article and the copyright belonged then to
the journal in which it was published and
[SPEAKER_03]: later wanted to be able to reuse one of
the tables or graphs that was in that and
[SPEAKER_03]: had to pay three hundred dollars in order
to reuse his own work because he had given
[SPEAKER_03]: up his copyright when he published it in
that in that journal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also do individual consultations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of the librarians here have their
own specialty and would be glad to meet
[SPEAKER_03]: individually with faculty or students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see a list of some of the
ideas some of the areas that we'll be glad
[SPEAKER_03]: to meet one on one and consult with you
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a copy of the web page
where you can submit that request and
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll get passed on to the appropriate
person with expertise in the area that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to mention just briefly TEAL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may be familiar with TEAL.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a project that was started by Mann
Library.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I guess probably 10 years or so ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: TEAL stands for the Essential Electronic
Agricultural Library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an effort to make scholarly works
particularly in agriculture but other
[SPEAKER_03]: related subjects as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Available in the developing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an offline system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the research institutions in
developing some of the developing
[SPEAKER_03]: countries don't have regular and
consistent internet access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is an offline system.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are special arrangements with the
publishers a total of 80 more than 80
[SPEAKER_03]: publishers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that's been going on
in Mann Library for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been received very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may have also noticed a recent
press release where we received a Gates
[SPEAKER_03]: Foundation grant in an area of four point
nine million dollars to continue to build
[SPEAKER_03]: this and expand both the content that's
there as well as the number of sites where
[SPEAKER_03]: it is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it distributed on hard drives?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes at this point it's distributed on hard
drives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally when we started this we were
sending out many CDs but it's now on hard
[SPEAKER_03]: drives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point 400 institutions
scattered around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concentration has been Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more effort with this new grant to
reach out to South Asia and Southeast Asia
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the eligible, it mentions eligible
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gross domestic product I believe it is
is what is measuring whether or not
[SPEAKER_03]: they're eligible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's high enough the country's not
eligible and they'd be expected to
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase from the commercial publishers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's low enough then it's
countrywide available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still, there's a fee associated
with it but it's substantially reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: from what commercial subscription prices
would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an example of some of the
international work that we're doing here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one more project that I would just
like to mention real briefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one that I'm directly involved in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bailey Hortorium has a very large
collection of seed and nursery catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: A large portion of that is actually housed
in Mann Library in the special
[SPEAKER_03]: collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go back to I think the earliest
catalog is actually a broadside from about
[SPEAKER_03]: 1771.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we in collaboration with three other
institutions did receive a grant recently
[SPEAKER_03]: which will allow us to digitize some of
our seed and nursery catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing this in conjunction with the
Biodiversity Heritage Library which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: consortium of about 15 different libraries
mostly in botanical garden libraries and
[SPEAKER_03]: natural history museum libraries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell and Harvard are the two academic
institutions that are collaborators in
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goal here is to make the
biodiversity literature very broadly
[SPEAKER_03]: conceived, basically life sciences
literature available for free open access
[SPEAKER_03]: on the web.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this gives you some sense of the size
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody heard of Biodiversity Heritage
Library before?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the collaborators in this case are
Missouri Botanical Garden and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're actually, the main point of
the whole project, the leading point is to
[SPEAKER_03]: create crowd sourcing and gaming on the
Biodiversity Heritage site so that
[SPEAKER_03]: participants can actually contribute to
the correction of OCRing of the text.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these old texts that are in here,
many of them are old, not all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's varying fonts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's varying languages with different
characters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the text itself is OCRed,
it's read by the computer, the accuracy
[SPEAKER_03]: level is not real high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a game will be developed that will
allow users to actually correct that text
[SPEAKER_03]: error and to improve the full text
discovery in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So New York Botanical Garden and Cornell
are involved in this mainly to contribute
[SPEAKER_03]: yet another sort of genre or format of
material to Biodiversity Heritage Library
[SPEAKER_03]: which is mainly journals and books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're adding seed catalogs sort of
as a different type of material that this
[SPEAKER_03]: gaming will be applied to as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're coordinating with New York
Botanical Garden on digitizing some from
[SPEAKER_03]: both of our collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a very significant collection
there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the highlights that I wanted
to provide and I'll turn it over to Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless there's one or two questions
right now, we'll take questions at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my name is Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to talk to you a little bit
about instruction and the types of
[SPEAKER_07]: instruction that we have at MAN.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't necessarily have to deal just
with faculty and faculty teaching classes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have some graduate groups contacting
us to maybe set up workshops that we could
[SPEAKER_07]: demonstrate some of our services or things
that can help them in their own research.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are your partner in seeking
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of styled my slides after like
a paper, like a science paper that you
[SPEAKER_07]: might have your students writing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a little abstract of what
happens when you partner with the
[SPEAKER_07]: libraries.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we set up instruction, if you're
doing a session that's in person with us,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's librarian led instruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: You partner with us to develop different
types of assessment of the student
[SPEAKER_07]: learning and the whole goal is to improve
the types of informational resources the
[SPEAKER_07]: students use.
[SPEAKER_07]: and can find.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it comes from these questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever thought that students should
be finding better quality sources?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever wish that your students or
even yourself could break away from Google
[SPEAKER_07]: or even Google Scholar and find better
quality sources or even more sources that
[SPEAKER_07]: are available on Google?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or have you ever wanted to help students
build a better research paper?
[SPEAKER_07]: If these questions have ever come up to
you or maybe they've just now come up to
[SPEAKER_07]: you, you might want to schedule some
instruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a little review of some literature.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is taken from the Cornell strategic
plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see that information literacy
is the sixth one down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's specific to the library.
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will be able to access,
evaluate, and use a variety of relevant
[SPEAKER_07]: information sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you look through several of them,
there are several that kind of relate to
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for information, such as
communication skills, be able to speak
[SPEAKER_07]: articulately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that seems like a stretch,
but if they can find the information,
[SPEAKER_07]: they can research and they have more to
say about the subject.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reasoning, self-directed learning,
that's a huge one.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole goal of our library instruction
is also to be partnering with you to make
[SPEAKER_07]: lifelong learners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so here are the materials you'll
need.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll need the request form.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the request form is found on the
Mann Library's website under workshops and
[SPEAKER_07]: instruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And request instruction right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a single form for any
request you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just quickly fill it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you fill it out, the big thing
you need to worry about is the preferred
[SPEAKER_07]: date of the session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't just put one if you can help it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to schedule this as early as
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may think a month is enough time,
and it usually is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's during our peak season,
a month is not enough time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you may not get the preferred session.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the best time to do it is probably,
if you're going to do it for spring,
[SPEAKER_07]: December is the best time to make a
request.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you're going to make the request,
make it in April because January,
[SPEAKER_07]: February, and even in the March are peak
times and it's really hard to get
[SPEAKER_07]: instruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and the other materials you'll want
to have ready and available will be the
[SPEAKER_07]: assignment for the class.
[SPEAKER_07]: That way, when we have a meeting,
you know what you want from us so we can
[SPEAKER_07]: actually give you the information you need
instead of have just a general service.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want your calendar to schedule your
class.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a syllabus for the course so you
can share it with us so we can make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: we're providing the best service as
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do ask, and you don't have to,
we ask that you allow us to partner with
[SPEAKER_07]: you on Blackboard so we can create a
folder and we can flip the classroom as
[SPEAKER_07]: much as possible so that when the students
come in and meet with us, they can
[SPEAKER_07]: actually have more hands on and we can
answer questions instead of just talk at
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so after you make the request,
usually what I will do is I will partner
[SPEAKER_07]: you with your liaison librarian.
[SPEAKER_07]: In your case, your liaison librarian is
Marty, but he is not always available so
[SPEAKER_07]: all the librarians at MAN are actually
able to take your request and provide the
[SPEAKER_07]: same level of service as Marty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, in fact, we would actually partner
with him during the meeting so that he
[SPEAKER_07]: could bring up any other sources that he
may not be aware of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you do the meeting,
you're going to determine the outcome of
[SPEAKER_07]: the collaboration and the assignment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've given them an assignment and you
want to collaborate with us, but we want
[SPEAKER_07]: to make sure we have the right outcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to determine the type of
instruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to talk about the types of
instructions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So librarian-led instruction would just
have us be in front of the class.
[SPEAKER_07]: And go through all the different services
that we have available.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also offer libguides.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give you an example of a
libguide for a professor that is new and
[SPEAKER_07]: she's in animal sciences.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's actually not teaching a research
paper, but she was like, oh my goodness,
[SPEAKER_07]: and she heard about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, this is the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you create a libguide that's a
repository of stuff related to animal
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though she's not teaching a research
paper, she thought it would be great to
[SPEAKER_07]: have all these information available to
the students in one place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in progress, so we're continuing
to add to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to curate it myself,
or Marty may curate it himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she has some collaboration in there
where she tells us some new things that
[SPEAKER_07]: she finds and adds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're continuing to add things
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if you're not teaching a research
paper, libguides are great for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also have these two samples of
tutorials.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you the first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a series of classes that have been
developed over, has it been 10 years that
[SPEAKER_07]: they've been doing this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Around 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is high level, takes about 10
years to develop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at it, the instructor of
the library sessions works closely with
[SPEAKER_07]: the professor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of like a sequence series of
tabs that relate to assignments that are
[SPEAKER_07]: related to the agricultural, what's it,
AIM, agriculture engineer, economics
[SPEAKER_07]: management.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Applying economics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm newer here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only my sixth month.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he works with the professor to develop
all these tabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are some library instructions
that are actually graded and some that are
[SPEAKER_07]: not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just walks students through each
section of the library research they need
[SPEAKER_07]: to do that specific type of paper
assignment for the class.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want something like this,
yes, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to be a lot of partnership.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The libguide I showed you before took us
about an hour to get together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you explain a little bit more what
that libguide is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: This one you have open right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one, they just go to, there's a
URL right here, which is guides.library
[SPEAKER_07]: .cornell.edu slash animal genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we kind of kept it simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they go here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she had specific browsers she wanted
them to be able to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I put them in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some tutorials.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also are going to do, I don't think I
have the PubMed tutorial in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to add a PubMed tutorial because a
lot of students have problems with PubMed
[SPEAKER_07]: and how to use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to add more major
associations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we are finished here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found some online, I was a teacher
before, so I found some online tutorials
[SPEAKER_07]: and simulations for genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the University of Utah has an excellent
site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of, I know it's animal
genetics, but it's for basic genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we kind of added that information.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a specific question you want that
I didn't get?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a repository of stuff for all
the students to use related to animal
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to add major associations
for different, like the dairy cattle and
[SPEAKER_07]: goats and all the animals that they might
study in animal genetics related to the
[SPEAKER_07]: PreVet program and the agricultural side
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this libguide, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is just, they're doing a
financial analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to go to the databases
they need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there are videos that they can
watch that the librarian has made that
[SPEAKER_07]: walks them through how to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the librarian is very much embedded in
the class and has a lot of review sessions
[SPEAKER_07]: with them and then tells them how to
calculate ratios.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically kind of supplementary to
what the instructors teach them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I have one more I was going to
show you real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a nutrition tutorial.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one I think is about five years in
the making.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see it's much simpler looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what it actually does is it's two
tutorials that can be embedded into
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackboard, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, let's see if I haven't done
it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's related to a topic of
choosing a nutrition controversy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it leads them through how do you
evaluate sources?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you find a controversy that you
want to look for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you find the information?
[SPEAKER_07]: It has blogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has CQ researcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a tutorial that walks them
through and then gives them a quiz at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's part of the assessment process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the results.
[SPEAKER_07]: After you've had the class, we will do a
post assessment of the session because we
[SPEAKER_07]: want to make sure the students learn what
we had set up in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're working on developing different
classroom assessment tools that would be
[SPEAKER_07]: embedded in the class.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't seem like they're being
assessed again, but they actually are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we receive feedback from you on
what worked and what did not work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the goal is to kind of keep fine
tuning in the class until it gets better
[SPEAKER_07]: and better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're more efficient in what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the assignment would be reworked based
on the assessment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every one of us does this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more information you give us to
change, the better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So conclusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're your partners in improving the
information seeking behaviors of yourself,
[SPEAKER_07]: of students, anyone you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're driven by desired outcomes and
assessments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are linked to the academic
competencies as outlined in the strategic
[SPEAKER_07]: plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our future research, because we're growing
and we don't have as many librarians as
[SPEAKER_07]: needed for the kind of classes we're
getting asked to do, we're trying to look
[SPEAKER_07]: for ways to make more embedded library
instruction and use different technologies
[SPEAKER_07]: that are online so we can expand our
services.
[SPEAKER_07]: And any other ideas you might have?
[SPEAKER_07]: We are open to those ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is Keith.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm the GIS librarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone who's not using GIS as a
technology doesn't have any idea what GIS
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should start with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically geographic information
systems, which is why I think they put
[SPEAKER_04]: another word in my title that actually is
a full word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geospatial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that gives a clue of what sorts of
things I deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So GIS at MAM Library, I provide the main
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a colleague who helps out with
the workshops, data, and consultations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll walk through each of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the workshops, we offer
introductory workshops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say introductory, because it's like
two hours, just the tip of the iceberg for
[SPEAKER_04]: various GIS software.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done ArcGIS for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you might be familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one that tends to be used by the
Cornell courses.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a GIS course in Crop and Server
Science, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all use ArcGIS.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few years ago, they used to use
Manifold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's a lot of grad students
hanging around who still use Manifold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do introductory workshops for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then QGIS is an open source GIS
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these do the same thing, by the way,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the interfaces are completely
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes if you use one, it's helpful
to go to the other workshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But QGIS is an open source program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping to offer a new workshop
later this spring, date to be determined.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other two programs where we have
the workshops up on the workshop schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: that I think Marty so importantly,
on the ManLibrary website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a whole bunch of workshops there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of data, ManLibrary has hosted
for about 15 years a repository of
[SPEAKER_04]: geospatial data that's focused on New York
State.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have data in here across the state,
things like agricultural districts,
[SPEAKER_04]: USGS topographic maps, elevation data,
all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of data specific to Tompkins
County because we have a pretty close
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship with the Tompkins County
folks in the city of Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a lot richer data sets for
Tompkins than the rest of the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we also have some research
oriented data sets that were created here
[SPEAKER_04]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a study of French Creek
watersheds in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just knowing that we had this
repository, there was a connection made
[SPEAKER_04]: with the researchers doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we now host that data for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were generating data,
especially if it's in New York State,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested in talking with you to
see if it's the sort of thing that would
[SPEAKER_04]: be useful to distribute to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the long term, we are also interested
in migrating to a new technology which
[SPEAKER_04]: will also enable us to move beyond New
York State because I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: research that's being done here at Cornell
that's not focused on New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be nice to provide a home for
that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This newer portal, it's called Open
Geoportal, was originally developed at
[SPEAKER_04]: Tulsa University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically we'll be migrating our
servers being set up today, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Migrating our data over into this format
so we'll be able to just zoom into an area
[SPEAKER_04]: and get a list of all the data sets that
apply that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can narrow it down by keywords.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can even preview the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an example of a street center line
for Summerville, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can kind of preview that,
click on things, and see what data is
[SPEAKER_04]: available for each street segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can imagine previewing other data
sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a tree data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can click on the tree and see what
data is available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the species?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the diameter of the tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: What other information is available in
that data set?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gives you a good opportunity to
preview the data set before downloading a
[SPEAKER_04]: giant thing and booting up your ArcGIS or
whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also been working on something I call
the GeoLoad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for people who are looking for the
mother load of geospatial data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea, it's basically a catalog of
websites on the internet anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world that host geospatial data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just describing them basically,
so this covers China, it's historical GIS
[SPEAKER_04]: data, and it's mainly boundaries,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sort of level of detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea is that you can come in here,
limit it to your particular area of
[SPEAKER_04]: interest or a particular topic,
like transportation or forests or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: it might be, to narrow it down to a few
websites that you have to go search out,
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than just doing wild Google
searches and coming up with all sorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: irrelevant things that you have to go
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bulk of what I do tends to be
one-on-one consultations with students,
[SPEAKER_04]: staff, faculty, and there are four boxes
on this slide template.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the top four things I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Troubleshooting software, converting data,
mapping, and geospatial analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So troubleshooting software, whenever you
try to use ArcGIS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone here use ArcGIS?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever come up with errors before?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times you get these weird
messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really make any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So just, even if I don't even know what
the tool is supposed to do, I can probably
[SPEAKER_04]: help you figure out how to get it to go
through the process without coming up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the error.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's my hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's so many tools in ArcGIS and the
other GIS programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know every single thing in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's sometimes a limit to how much
help I can provide, but basic
[SPEAKER_04]: troubleshooting is definitely something
that I cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: Converting data is a whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, someone had an Excel
spreadsheet of farms, I believe that were
[SPEAKER_04]: all producing fibers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like llama farms and sheep and goats
and all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they only had the street addresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to see where that was
geographically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that involved some conversion to
geocode those addresses to get latitude
[SPEAKER_04]: and longitude coordinates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then they could do further analysis
while mapping with that data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another form of converting data,
I was trying to remember what the original
[SPEAKER_04]: data set was up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically a database of trees and
the amount of forested area of different
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first we had to isolate all the oak
trees and then the person was interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in aggregating that by county.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to get a total count of approximate
acreage of oak trees in each county.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that then they could pick out selected
counties for like a random sample or for
[SPEAKER_04]: further research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mapping is a very time consuming process.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever tried to create a completed
map with lots of labels, notice there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: labels on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That made it a lot easier, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as soon as you have different
layers of data and lots of different
[SPEAKER_04]: labels and you want everything to be
legible and clear and it's a static image
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can't zoom into anymore because
it's going into your published journal
[SPEAKER_04]: paper, it can be very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't do mapping myself,
but I can help advise you on what tools
[SPEAKER_04]: you might need, how you might be able to
get the labels to work out the way you
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a case, someone was studying
coral reefs in the Caribbean and needed a
[SPEAKER_04]: way to depict the direction and velocity
of ocean currents in different times of
[SPEAKER_04]: the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we worked with Manifold to figure out
how to get the symbology to work to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the arrows at the right angles at the
right sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was another example, someone was
studying the frogs, particular species in
[SPEAKER_04]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had done all this genetic testing and
they knew the genetic distances between
[SPEAKER_04]: these and they wanted to see how that
compared with the geographic distances.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that was interesting is that
there's this mountain range and there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: way these frogs would have ever gone over
those mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to try to look at the genetic
distances and geographic distances to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out which way they may have
migrated historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Tajikistan, a map of ethnic
regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just some examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one that actually did get involved
with helping with the labeling a lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: boy was that time consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're gonna do mapping,
set some nice time.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of analysis, the sky's the limit
in terms of what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I mentioned, there's these three
different programs that I'm familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: and they each have different ways of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more or less they have the same sorts
of tools and sometimes you have an idea in
[SPEAKER_04]: your head about what you want to analyze
and maybe just crunch, get certain data
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the GIS program and bring it into
your statistics package that you might be
[SPEAKER_04]: more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, well what function do
I need to run?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can help you identify what tools you
might actually want to do, want to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was an example of crime in Washington
DC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a terrifying data set when you open
up and there's these points everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just one year of data of arrests.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was a basic density analysis to
see where the hot spots were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the researcher on this was looking
at arrests before and after they made some
[SPEAKER_04]: policy change about how late the subway
ran and what times the bars had to close.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little more to the natural
sciences here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a geospatial analysis of viper
species richness in the western
[SPEAKER_04]: hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone was looking at analyzing where
are there more species of vipers in each
[SPEAKER_04]: region and this is just sort of a heat map
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he was comparing it with various
other factors, environmental factors to
[SPEAKER_04]: try to understand what would help to lead
to this rich diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to do that you have to figure out what
tools you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert on all these tools by
any means but I can help point you to the
[SPEAKER_04]: correct tools to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really it's more about
troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you need any help with any of that,
come see me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad somebody put my name on this
slide because I realized I forgot to put
[SPEAKER_09]: my name on these slides that I provided.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm here to talk to you about research
data management services at the library
[SPEAKER_09]: and at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as the slide before this said,
my name is Sarah Wright and I'm the life
[SPEAKER_09]: sciences librarian so I'm from the library
but I'm also part of this research data
[SPEAKER_09]: management service group which is campus
wide and I'll tell you a little bit more
[SPEAKER_09]: about that later on in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, why all the buzz about data
management?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we talking about data management?
[SPEAKER_09]: Funders are increasingly encouraging
researchers to share their data.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this report was put out way back in
2008 at this point and this was the work
[SPEAKER_09]: of almost two dozen different federal
agencies who got together and talked about
[SPEAKER_09]: what we needed to do to harness the power
of digital data for science and society.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they in this report described data
management plans pretty thoroughly and the
[SPEAKER_09]: requirements that have since come out from
the National Science Foundation that you
[SPEAKER_09]: have to have a data management plan with
every grant proposal really mirrors the
[SPEAKER_09]: guidelines that they put out in this
report.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the NSF already has that requirement
and we're increasingly seeing and hearing
[SPEAKER_09]: about other agencies that are requiring
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, last January the OSTP put out
this mandate that any federal agency that
[SPEAKER_09]: spends over a hundred million in their
conduct of research needs to develop a
[SPEAKER_09]: plan to support increased public access to
the results of research funded by the
[SPEAKER_09]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see this for more and more
agencies.
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be the USDA, lots of agencies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Publishers are also requiring or
suggesting data sharing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nature and Science are very high
profile but a lot of other journals also
[SPEAKER_09]: require that you submit your data along
with your publication.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are requirements from publishers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what funders generally want to see in a
data management plan?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very broad.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't necessarily specific to the
National Science Foundation but generally
[SPEAKER_09]: in a data management plan you should
describe what data you expect to collect
[SPEAKER_09]: in the course of the project.
[SPEAKER_09]: What data or metadata formats will you be
using?
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you be using any standards or data
formats that are particularly good for
[SPEAKER_09]: preservation, etc.
[SPEAKER_09]: Details like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you using those data and metadata
formats that you're choosing?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always good to explain why.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also would like to hear about your
plans for storing and preserving your data
[SPEAKER_09]: and how are you going to preserve access
to that data after, beyond the course of
[SPEAKER_09]: the grant.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long do you plan on keeping your data?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe your data is only valuable
for five years and so that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Explain that you're only going to keep
this data set for five years and it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: important beyond that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alternatively, maybe your data is very
important for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_09]: a period of time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to explain that and how you
plan on making sure that it's available
[SPEAKER_09]: for that long period.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you plan on sharing your data
and disseminating it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is like broader impacts.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is a very quick presentation so
I'm really not here to tell you about the
[SPEAKER_09]: details of how to create a data management
plan or plan really.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here to let you know that there is
support for Cornell investigators.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mentioned the research data
management service group earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a virtual organization and we
include people from the Center for
[SPEAKER_09]: Advanced Computing, the library,
Cornell Institute for Social and Economic
[SPEAKER_09]: Research, IT at Cornell and others.
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically what we are is we're just a
single point of contact.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have a question related to data
management plans you can ask us.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a question related to where
should I store my data, what's the best
[SPEAKER_09]: solution, short term or long term,
you can come have a conversation with us
[SPEAKER_09]: about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want us to come and talk to your
department about data management plan for
[SPEAKER_09]: longer than 10 minutes we'll also come and
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or your lab, maybe your lab is concerned
with how to best foster collaboration and
[SPEAKER_09]: sharing of data sets with another lab or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we are happy to come and talk to
groups about issues like that as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have cards with me today but I
would like to point out that the URL for
[SPEAKER_09]: our website is down at the bottom of each
of these slides.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's data.research.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if at any point you want to contact
us, you can contact us at rdmsg-help
[SPEAKER_09]: .cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can get in touch with Marty and
he'll hook you up with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do contact us, these are some of
the consultants.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Keith.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just saw his face.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are some of the experts that will be
able to help you with your data.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a wide range with different
kinds of expertise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the most part we are all human.
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for maybe Wyman Miles down there
from IT.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't get a picture of him for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mentioned really quickly we have a
website with lots of different data
[SPEAKER_09]: management services info and we're
increasing the amount of training material
[SPEAKER_09]: on the website.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I invite you to go check out our
website.
[SPEAKER_09]: As you just saw we have a consultant pool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a ticketing and triage system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you send that email to rdmsg-help,
it will go to one of those human beings
[SPEAKER_09]: and they will respond to you and be able
to sit down and actually have a
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation with you about your needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also do information sessions on NSF
data management plans as well as other
[SPEAKER_09]: questions you might have.
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, if you're thinking about
depositing data into the institutional
[SPEAKER_09]: repository eCommons, then we can do an
information session on depositing
[SPEAKER_09]: information into eCommons.
[SPEAKER_09]: So different information sessions.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have operating principles.
[SPEAKER_09]: We pledge that we will provide timely and
professional assistance.
[SPEAKER_09]: We frequently get questions the night
before the grant is due and we will do our
[SPEAKER_09]: best to respond to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you give us a little bit more lead
time we can definitely do a better job
[SPEAKER_09]: with helping you with your data management
plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do encourage best practices in data
management and we do treat the information
[SPEAKER_09]: that you give us as confidential.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we might share information with another
consultant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have questions about GIS data in
addition to some other type of data,
[SPEAKER_09]: I might consult with Keith to help answer
the GIS question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will consult inside the group,
but we will treat your information as
[SPEAKER_09]: confidential and we won't share it
outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we refer you to the most appropriate
services at Cornell or elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the most appropriate service is not
a Cornell service, we'll refer you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was worried about time, but I think I
made it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So questions for any of us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Marty, it's Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if for our people here,
if somebody could talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: the form for requesting an instruction
session and if they would use that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted a session here at GLE.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're certainly welcome to use that form
and we would always then make the
[SPEAKER_03]: connection with the right person for
leading that instruction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should have pointed out earlier that
I'm the liaison to the horticulture
[SPEAKER_03]: department and that includes the people
who are based here in Ithaca as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: those who are based in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mike is really the first point of
contact at Geneva in almost all cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the easiest just to be in touch with
Mike and he can either handle the question
[SPEAKER_03]: or refer it to me or somebody else in Mann
Library.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of collaboration back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike has been teaching some sessions in
Geneva not just for Cornell students
[SPEAKER_03]: because there aren't a lot of Cornell
students in Geneva, but actually teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: sessions for the Enology and Viticulture
program that's part of the Finger Lakes
[SPEAKER_03]: Community College because they come to the
library there to use that material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Geneva has the bulk of the Enology
and Viticulture literature within the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell Library system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So feel free Geneva people to use that
form or the research consultation form,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also feel free to contact Mike
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would
[SPEAKER_03]: be an example where you could refer them
to the library for consultation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be glad to do that for a graduate
student in particular who's ready to dig
[SPEAKER_03]: into the literature, wanting to know what
resources might be most appropriate for
[SPEAKER_03]: their particular research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd be glad to sit down for an hour
with somebody on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly, do we have any general sessions on
research?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had general sort of introductory
courses to doing library literature
[SPEAKER_03]: research in the past, just open workshops
that weren't integrated into a course and
[SPEAKER_03]: over time the interest in that had
diminished.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's demand for that we could
consider doing that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some other open workshops that
aren't course-specific, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have one specifically on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead Sarah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one on PubMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has come and taken away the
fourth floor of the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the third floor going to be available
in the years to come?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you looking for space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I used to enjoy working on the
fourth floor, now I'm down on the third
[SPEAKER_01]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just hoping that over time all of
the books don't go out to the annex and we
[SPEAKER_01]: end up with just a big server sitting
there in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all the electronic access,
but I also think a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_01]: having some space up there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope the third floor doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we hope so too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been assured at this point that
we've given up as much space as we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be giving up in the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he's alluding to is that we did
consolidate the collection substantially,
[SPEAKER_03]: the print collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a significant portion of that
collection went to the annex.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a lot of print material in
the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the library space is primarily the
first, second and third floor at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is going to change, perhaps the
most, is we're going to be increasing the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of collaborative and study space
for students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, anybody can use it,
but that's our target audience for the
[SPEAKER_03]: library.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you saw some of the different types of
space that we have been providing and we
[SPEAKER_03]: see enormous amount of use of that and
we'll be continuing to expand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may remember or know that some
of the second floor space is currently
[SPEAKER_03]: being occupied by non-library staff from
human ecology and from the CALS and human
[SPEAKER_03]: ecology business offices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will be moving out in the next
little while to other space and we will be
[SPEAKER_03]: regaining what's on the second floor
non-library office right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be increasing the amount of
space available for study space and
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborative workspace and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel strongly and I think it's fair to
say that the library feels strongly that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're a residential institution and we
really need to make that student
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, maximize that student
experience in the library as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that many students, particularly
undergraduate students, are increasingly
[SPEAKER_03]: taking online courses and if we're going
to really compete with that, we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: make that residential experience
substantially better than an online
[SPEAKER_03]: experience can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on the part of the library,
having a diversity of study and activity
[SPEAKER_03]: spaces, research spaces is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
