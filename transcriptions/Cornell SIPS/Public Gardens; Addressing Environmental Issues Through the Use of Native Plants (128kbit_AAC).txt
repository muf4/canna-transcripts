[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you all for being here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to talk about what I've been
doing the past two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely flown by.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as an introduction to this topic,
Don mentioned that I had spent some time
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens and
working in their native plant collection,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really developed some interests that
were instrumental in developing this
[SPEAKER_03]: topic, public gardens addressing
environmental issues through the use of
[SPEAKER_03]: native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So native plants have existed for
millennia, have evolved with their
[SPEAKER_03]: environments, and have become increasingly
popular in the cultivated landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the purposes of this research,
a native plant is one that occurs
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally in a particular region,
state, ecosystem, and habit without direct
[SPEAKER_03]: or indirect human action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to provide a context for this study,
I am studying native plants in public
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens, which are living museums,
mission-based institutions which maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: plant collections and plant records by a
professional staff and are open to the
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: The study of native plants are important
to botanical gardens because they serve
[SPEAKER_03]: missions including displaying
biodiversity, beauty, and history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I began this study, I started
questioning why native plants were
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing in use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my observations was that they
were being used to address environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: issues such as food for wildlife,
a reduction in the use of chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides, fertilizers, and water when
planted in their natural habitats,
[SPEAKER_03]: preventing the spread of alien-invasive
plants, contributing to phytoremediation
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts, addressing climate change,
and increasing ecosystem biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also are valued for their aesthetic,
beauty, and regional sense of place.
[SPEAKER_03]: My research objectives for this study are
to understand how public gardens are using
[SPEAKER_03]: native plants throughout their gardens and
program offerings, what the motivations
[SPEAKER_03]: are for doing so, and if they are
addressing environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Native plants are supported by research,
but I wanted to know what motivates public
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens for using them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I chose four U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: botanical gardens based on preliminary
interviews, their prominence in the field,
[SPEAKER_03]: and their collections policies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I conducted two to three phone interviews
to maintain consistency with leadership
[SPEAKER_03]: staff of each garden, including the
executive director, director of
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture, and director of education
when applicable.
[SPEAKER_03]: These interviews were followed up by site
visits if I had previously not visited the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I conducted follow-up interviews based
on the need in the writing process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm just going to go through each
site.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first site was the Lady Bird Johnson
Wildflower Center, which is located in
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin, Texas, and it was created through
the vision of Lady Bird Johnson and
[SPEAKER_03]: actress Helen Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their mission serves to focus their
displays and education around native
[SPEAKER_03]: plants of the state of Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second site is New England Wildflower
Society's Living Museum Garden in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was founded and designed by Will
Curtis, and they display native plants of
[SPEAKER_03]: the New England region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education at Garden in the Woods centers
around engaging visitors to gain an
[SPEAKER_03]: interest in using native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third site was the Bloedel Reserve,
located on Bainbridge Island, Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was created through the inspiration of
Prentice Bloedel and his wife with the
[SPEAKER_03]: mission of providing a tranquil visitor
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: This series of landscapes spans over 150
acres and is picturesque of the Pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: The final site was the Birmingham
Botanical Gardens, which is unique to this
[SPEAKER_03]: study in that it offers a variety of
collections for visitors to experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: including two gardens of nature,
which focus on the display and education
[SPEAKER_03]: of native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The collections were made possible by
donations of money and volunteer hours by
[SPEAKER_03]: key individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'll tell you a little bit about
what I found in the form of key themes,
[SPEAKER_03]: differences, challenges, successes,
and practical implications from the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first theme was the use of native
plants throughout the gardens and program
[SPEAKER_03]: areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: As pictured here, native plants permeate
throughout the education and displays at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Wildflower Center and at Garden in the
Woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: While their styles vary at both of these
gardens, teaching people to understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate, and use the regional native
flora in a sustainable manner is central
[SPEAKER_03]: to the organizational goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The use of native plants at the Bloedel
Reserve is focused on providing a tranquil
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, they do not have a formal
education program.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Birmingham Botanical Gardens,
native plants are displayed in two areas,
[SPEAKER_03]: focusing on the biodiversity the state has
to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Barbara, Alabama Woodlands displays
mainly native trees and serves as the hub
[SPEAKER_03]: of native plant education for children.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Call Wildflower Garden was developed
from an old stone quarry from the Works
[SPEAKER_03]: Progress Administration and is pictured
here and displays herbaceous native
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, placing a special focus on those
of wild provenance in Alabama.
[SPEAKER_03]: While native plants are not central to
their mission at the Birmingham Botanical
[SPEAKER_03]: Gardens, they do offer educational
programming for all ages that encourages a
[SPEAKER_03]: deeper engagement with native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: A second theme was the motivation behind
the use of native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Key figures played a role in establishing
each garden or collection within the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden in each case of this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond that, the key figures, Lady Bird
Johnson, Will Curtis, and Pernis Bloedel,
[SPEAKER_03]: respectively at the Wildflower Center,
Garden in the Woods, and the Bloedel
[SPEAKER_03]: Reserve, were all influential in
establishing a mission that was
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumental in determining the plant
collections policies at these gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: A third theme was the motivation for using
native plants for environmental purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each garden in this study emphasized using
native plants for environmental purposes
[SPEAKER_03]: for a conservation purpose, thus promoting
an awareness, and in the case of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Wildflower Center and Garden in the Woods,
the use and further conservation of native
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden in the Woods further has a display
of rare and endangered native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gardens also display native plants in
order to enhance their natural world so as
[SPEAKER_03]: to bridge visitors to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of examples are public gardens
providing a place for visitors to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of climate change on plants and to
see solutions on how to address this
[SPEAKER_03]: issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the same way, they are using native
plants in their natural habitats to
[SPEAKER_03]: illustrate the reduction of water and
chemical inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some collections at the Wildflower Center
and Garden in the Woods specifically were
[SPEAKER_03]: established to address environmental
issues through their research efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Research areas included native plant
propagation, carbon sequestration with
[SPEAKER_03]: native grasses of Texas, green roof
composition, alternative turf mixes,
[SPEAKER_03]: water runoff, and others.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future, each garden in this study
is increasing efforts to reduce their
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another trend that arose in this study was
the focus of reaching three specific
[SPEAKER_03]: audience groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Professionals in the land in landscape
architecture, architecture, design,
[SPEAKER_03]: and contracting, young families,
and singles in their 20s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_03]: By creating various educational programs,
workshops, and garden events towards these
[SPEAKER_03]: different groups, they hope to garner
their interest and further their mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were two key differences between the
gardens in this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first difference was the specific
environmental issues that were addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because each garden resides in a different
climate zone in the U.S., each garden
[SPEAKER_03]: focuses on a different issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the Bluedale Reserve in
Washington State enjoys regular rainfall.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they are continually focused on
maintaining clean water sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wildflower Center in Central Texas
places a major focus on water conservation
[SPEAKER_03]: as they constantly face drought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another major difference was in the
educational programs offered.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bluedale Reserve was the only garden
in the study lacking a formal education
[SPEAKER_03]: program, although they do offer informal
programs such as walks and tours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education is completely focused on native
plants at the Wildflower Center and Garden
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And recently, the Birmingham Botanical
Gardens joined in efforts as all three of
[SPEAKER_03]: these gardens offer a native plant
certificate program.
[SPEAKER_03]: These certificates are awarded to
participants through their completion of
[SPEAKER_03]: required and elective courses,
field trips, and volunteer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each garden also experienced exceptional
success in various ways of using native
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three pictured here are ways that
gardens are disseminating information on
[SPEAKER_03]: native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The native plant database on the
Wildflower Center's website is
[SPEAKER_03]: internationally accessed and in last year
alone received five million hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: The recently launched certificate in
native plant studies at the Birmingham
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanical Gardens has had an overwhelming
success in that their response rate and
[SPEAKER_03]: that they have had to create more
classroom space to meet the demand and
[SPEAKER_03]: they have enjoyed an unexpected revenue
generated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The recent launch of New England
Wildflower Society's Go Botany program is
[SPEAKER_03]: a computer-based program that is used to
facilitate education and displays in a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of settings and according to
staff, is in high demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Success at the Bluedale Reserve comes in
the form of grant funding for restoration
[SPEAKER_03]: programs which have continually increased
over the past two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Staff members also note the anecdotal
feedback from visitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each garden also faces challenges that
affect their displays and educational
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts of native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these is managing invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today 1.4 trillion dollars or 5% of the
global economy is spent managing invasive
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: While historically public gardens may have
played a role in bringing invasive plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in through plant exploration, they are
recognizing their damaging effects and
[SPEAKER_03]: costs associated with them and are working
to prevent their future developments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other challenges included caring for a
large space with limited staff and budgets
[SPEAKER_03]: and overcoming the general lack of
knowledge of the value and importance of
[SPEAKER_03]: native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty picture to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using native plants in public gardens as
presented in this study culminates into a
[SPEAKER_03]: group of practical implications.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are intended to build the success of
other gardens' use of native plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: how they use them to address environmental
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: These include establishing expected
outcomes in their use, using them in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that continues the design of the garden,
using their connection with animals to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring in younger audiences, using them
throughout the collection instead of in
[SPEAKER_03]: individual collections, considering the
environmental effects of the design
[SPEAKER_03]: process, and to look at other
organizations for guides as creating
[SPEAKER_03]: successful displays and educational
programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I conducted this study to discover how
public gardens are using native plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: if a main motivation is to address
environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that these gardens are using
native plants in diverse ways to not only
[SPEAKER_03]: address environmental issues but also to
demonstrate that their value goes beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: their positive environmental roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: These gardens are able to display their
beauty, encouraging an understanding and
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciation of native plants and thus
furthering their use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to acknowledge my committee
and Cornell Plantations for funding and
[SPEAKER_03]: support throughout the process and the
other fellows in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie, did any of the places you visited
express a challenge of sourcing their
[SPEAKER_02]: native plants, such as propagating them or
finding them?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't because all gardens have
their own nurseries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really didn't come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they're all, some of them are
wild collecting seeds and no, it didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: come up in the interviews at all actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're trying to actually provide
sources for people in their community that
[SPEAKER_03]: do have challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Don.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the Lodell Reserve and the Birmingham
Botanical Gardens, where it's a mixture of
[SPEAKER_02]: native plant displays and non-natives,
are the horticulturists taking measures in
[SPEAKER_02]: the non-native displays to make sure that
they're not introducing invasives that
[SPEAKER_02]: could migrate into the native displays?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that where that comes up is more
at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Barbara Alabama Woodlands that I
mentioned is probably 20 feet from their
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Japanese garden does have invasive
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are constantly trying to pull
those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is something that they just
recognize as a challenge and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something that they have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Lodell Reserve, because everything
grows so fast, invasives are always a
[SPEAKER_03]: major challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the restoration programs that they are
implementing are really helping to address
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I
[SPEAKER_03]: think they're not sensing the pressure,
but they are wanting to reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The groups, so these certificate programs
that three of the gardens have,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are really trying to reach people in
the industries, like landscape
[SPEAKER_03]: architecture, to encourage green building
practices and establishing plants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: correct habitats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the pressure is more them
reaching out to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not getting that from people
outside, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of the gardens in the
study have seen the growth, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't specifically been tracking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is something that I recommend for
future research to really see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts are in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
