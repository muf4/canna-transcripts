[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the thing I would like to tell you
today is not really talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional leaf removal is a fairly
well-known technique which is done in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard to open up the canopy,
to improve the cluster macroclimate,
[SPEAKER_01]: to improve air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to talk today on some
specific and peculiar applications of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first kind of leaf removal we will be
talking is early leaf removal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then in the final part of my talk I
will address briefly also a very new kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaf removal which is apical to the
cluster late leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is an image of a traditional
leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture was taken in California,
so basically removing all the basal leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: around the clusters in order to improve
light and air ventilation and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is basically not the topic of
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason because we become interested in
a different kind of leaf removal in Italy
[SPEAKER_01]: is very much related also to climate
change, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a cluster of our main variety,
which is Sangiovese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would notice actually that the most
exposed part of the cluster is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not show full color.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very simple mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in the middle of the Po
Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside we have 35 degrees Celsius on
average in summer, and this cluster heats
[SPEAKER_01]: up easily to 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have poor coloring effect,
but you can also have sunburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also are facing a lot of water stress
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, even with the aim of trying
to regulate the cluster microclimate,
[SPEAKER_01]: we addressed what would have been changing
the timing of leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can do leaf removal from
pre-flowering until very late in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our major focus at the beginning was on
this kind of issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a Barbera cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbera is a fairly important variety for
us, grown most in the north of Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Tribiano-Romagnolo cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both very thick, fat clusters,
very susceptible to rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In wet seasons, we end up very easily in
this kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to explain the problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a combination of botrytis and sour
rot, and that's a blend on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strange because when you do work on
grapevine ecophysiology, in many cases
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not really inventing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are basically using old principles in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a study which was done in 1958 by
Brian Coombe on Grenache.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, he showed very nicely that
if you remove a given number of leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-blown on a given shoot, of course,
going from all the leaves on the shoot to
[SPEAKER_01]: no leaves, you would dramatically decrease
fruit sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is if you have an intact
tip on the shoot, because if you remove
[SPEAKER_01]: the tip, you're sort of counterbalancing
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this effect, in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: was seen as a sort of negative thing which
you should not be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we thought maybe we should actually
use this principle in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started working and it was the initial
trial in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to use this very early leaf
removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the leaf removal is applied at,
let's say, pre-flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that this cluster still has mostly
closed flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just a couple of open flowers,
but this is known as a separated flower
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to use a basil leaf removal,
very early in the season, removing from
[SPEAKER_01]: six to eight basil leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which seems quite crazy, I understand
that, because when you do that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard, the vineyard looks like this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I advise you, if you want to try
first, just select a corner in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vineyard, do that in just a small area,
hiding from everybody, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_01]: people would think that you are really
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after the leaf removal,
the vine, the canopy looks basically
[SPEAKER_01]: naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you that it's not really a
problem, because of course we do this very
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the season and we do have a lot
of time for regrowth afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the initial goal was, OK, now if I do
this, am I able to significantly reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit set?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the goal was, I want to reduce
fruit set to reduce cluster thickness in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to increase tolerance to rot.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must say that the initial trial,
which was done on the cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: Trebbiano-Romagnolo, which is fairly
important in my area, it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, very briefly, non-defoliated,
here there is a pre-flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: deforestation removing the first eight
basal leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eight basal leaves is a quite severe
treatment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we also tried post-flowering,
removing again eight basal leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there was an intermediate one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four leaves before and four leaves
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as expected, we did see a significant
decrease in fruit set, but 10% less fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: set is a huge decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you need to refer that to the
total number of flowers and then to the
[SPEAKER_01]: total number of berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was amazing that the cluster weight
basically halved from 400 grams is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly fat cluster, as I mentioned,
to basically 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lower berry weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, much lower berry number per
cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there was a significant effect
on rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in this case, we wanted to have at
least a wet season, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we wanted, we needed botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you that 203, in my area,
it has been the driest season over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 450 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really have the chance to
test for this feature, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: encouraging seeing that there was a
positive trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is another interesting point
that the bud fruitfulness was not really
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by the treatment over the three
years, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I show you the morphology of the
different clusters in the different
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments, that is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a traditional fat,
thick Tribiano cluster versus a sample of
[SPEAKER_01]: a cluster from the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would notice that the looseness is
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is already a very good result.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people is actually asking,
what about quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look at just at the color of
the clusters, you would notice that this
[SPEAKER_01]: one and this one in particular,
they seem more ripened than the other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is just because for us,
a fruiting area of Tribiano looking like
[SPEAKER_01]: this is truly unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you usually it looks like totally
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look at the quality
parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaks, you say that in all the
defoliation treatments, we had at least
[SPEAKER_01]: two degrees breaks higher concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, the total acidity was not
decreased because we did have an increase
[SPEAKER_01]: in tartatic acid, whereas the malic was
slightly decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the main explanation for having
overall an increase in grade quality when
[SPEAKER_01]: you have basically removed the good
leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is difficult to understand,
at least on a first thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a fairly logic that when you look
at the leaf error to fruit ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the last column here,
this is the leaf error to yield ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was actually estimated at the end of
the season in square centimeters per gram,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would actually notice that all the
three leaf removal treatments had a mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly higher ratio than the
non-defoliated wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is fairly logic, because the
effect you induce through leaf removal is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually reducing yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reduction in yield is often more
than proportional to the reduction in leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the story, the leaf error
to fruit ratio would actually increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf removal treatments, which is a
fairly strong physiological principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at that point, okay, now we know that
it works on Trebbiano, but does it work
[SPEAKER_01]: also on other varieties or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just a feature of Trebbiano?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started to do more experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned at the beginning of the
talk, we grow in Italy more than 70,000
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares of San Giovese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So San Giovese is a top variety for us,
and so we care very much about this red
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the results we got on San
Giovese were extremely interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one case study.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see non-defoliated versus defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, removing the first six main leaves
from the basal part of the shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you are now used to see that the
fruit set was decreased, berry weight was
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased, but most importantly,
bricks was increased as long as also the
[SPEAKER_01]: color was increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in San Giovese, color is always a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Giovese is a poor accumulating
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to try to have the right
grade composition in order to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brunello-style wine, Michaela knows that
very well, you need to have color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And color is always a limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Giovese is a very difficult variety to
be grown in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this particular case, it was really a
very useful outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, at a given point,
some other people were luckier than myself
[SPEAKER_01]: in getting some botrytis on bunch rot in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, you just see what could be the
impact of the defoliated treatments versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the botrytis incidence versus the
non-defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going fast because the other remaining
effects are basically similar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: preceding ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more bricks and more color in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that the technique has
been also applied in other environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, this is a study which has
been done by Brian Head in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a fairly complex study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually comparing early leaf
removal by hand, before bloom or after
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom, or mechanical leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the issue is that if you take this
comparison between pre-flowering at trace
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom leaf removal, you see this is a
percent clusters infected with botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you compare at the same number of
sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the phenological stages when the
vines were sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two sprays in both cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that the reduction at the same
number of sprays of this treatment versus
[SPEAKER_01]: a traditional technique is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically holding all the
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing is now at this point,
the interpretation I gave you about the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher leaf error to fruit ratio was based
only on an estimation of leaf area and
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But leaf area not necessarily is a good
predictor of canopy function.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have two vines having the same
leaf area, but the canopy photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: can be very different depending,
for example, on leaf orientation,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf inclination, and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, we wanted to make sure that
the physiology of the leaf removed vines
[SPEAKER_01]: was exactly what we assumed it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used our whole canopy gas
exchange system for actually measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole season, before leaf
removal until harvest continuously along
[SPEAKER_01]: the season, the whole canopy gas exchange,
basically photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, again, a Sun's Oasis trial,
controlled, defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you see, I mean, you are used to see
now reduced fruit set, lower balance per
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, when we calculated
the net carbon exchange rate per shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the yield, which is actually a
measured parameter, it's not an estimated
[SPEAKER_01]: parameter, you see that the yield ratio is
actually increased consistently in the
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliated vines versus the controlled
vines, and this is due mostly to the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that the yield is decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But although the leaf removal would remove
leaves at the very beginning, you do have,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, photosynthetic compensation
from the remaining leaves, and also having
[SPEAKER_01]: removed some leaves early in the season
would actually push more regrowth from
[SPEAKER_01]: lateral shoots later in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you combine all these kind of
effects, you would explain why the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic efficiency of that canopy
versus the yield was higher, as we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem is, okay, the grower comes
and he tells you, okay, it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: you convinced me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have 20 hectares of vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to do this by hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crazy, I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next step was, can we mechanize
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we can mechanize this
operation, of course we open up a new
[SPEAKER_01]: world in terms of application,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be mechanized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here the work we have been doing is really
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to show you really a summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it depends very much on the
type of machine you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends very much on the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably depends very much also on the
driver skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will understand that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the best leaf removal machine to be
used for this operation is this kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an air pressure machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This machine does not suck, but it blows
air at a very high pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mechanism is, that if you blow air
at very high pressure, at that stage where
[SPEAKER_01]: all the flowers are still closed,
but the flower bottoms are already
[SPEAKER_01]: separated among them, the air actually
goes through the cluster without actually
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling the cluster out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would actually get actually all
the leaves, or most of the leaves pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, this is the kind
of result you would like to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, in this case, the machine was
able to remove the blade of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the inflorescence is intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because it's not fair if you go
with the machine, and the machine is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to cut the clusters in two
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point, at the end of the
season, you say, hey, the yield was
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but it was decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because you decreased fruit set.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was decreased because you removed part
of the cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not fair for our goal,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, the results you might
get are really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before actually making a comment on this
table, look at this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quite amazing case study,
because they have been using the technique
[SPEAKER_01]: also in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a vineyard of Grenache in La
Rioja.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some impressive features here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, the fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average fruitfulness of these shoots
is three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the kind of soil, it didn't help a
lot in this kind of trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the problem is that they do
have a yield limit in this area,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is 6.5 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield limit is 6.5 tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that this vineyard would crop
higher than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably more than two times that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they actually need to adjust to
regulate crop level by cluster thinning or
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say that using this technique,
they have been able actually to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: yield to a reasonable level without having
to do any manual operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it came out fairly nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going back for a second just to
show some of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to use the mechanical early
leaf removal, non-defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hand leaf removal in the black
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue color shows the two mechanical
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mechanical early leaf removal pre
bloom, mechanical early leaf removal post
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do see that, again, on Sangiovese,
there was an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the effect is generally milder
than the effect you get when you use hand
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you use a machine,
you don't really remove all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some leaves stay on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the limiting effect you are getting
is lesser than the limiting effect you get
[SPEAKER_01]: when you do that by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works because in Sangiovese,
going from half a kilo cluster down to,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, 368 grams is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another issue which is very much
related to the question of how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: change over the season cluster macro
climate depending on the timing of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, let's make a comparison
between early leaf removal and traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: late leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be, at the end of the season,
the likely cluster macro climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would have to answer this
question, what would you think is of the
[SPEAKER_01]: two pictures of the early season leaf
removal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Michele is pointing towards this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you see, this is a Barbera
vineyard which has been subjected to early
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the cluster macro
climate, you cannot say that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: clusters are really exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a sort of intermediate exposure
with some diffuse light, some sun flags,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in this case, of course,
the clusters were already harvested here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you imagine having clusters on,
you would think that all the clusters are
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issue is that although we early
leaf remove, we do get from the basal
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes of the main shoots some lateral
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those lateral shoots would cast some
shade later on the season on the clusters
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to protect the clusters from
direct radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the season, in many
cases, you end up having a sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate macro climate, which is
exactly what you aim for in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the next step was, OK, again,
the grower comes and it tells you,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, you convinced me that it can be
done by machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I don't have the time to do that
by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have the machine, and don't trust
the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I do at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have any other alternative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, the physiological
principle of the technique is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to induce a calibrated source
limitation pre-flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do that by removing leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a source limitation can be induced
also with shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of removing leaves, you shade the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thinking of shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with nets of different kinds of
the basal part of the canopy, exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-flowering, and then probably some ways
you need to remove the shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awkward, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other option was that on the market
you find very easily anti-transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are basically substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one we used.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pinoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural compound which is extracted
from the pine resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can actually apply on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after you apply that, you see that
it's a film forming compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wraps, basically, the leaf within a
transparent film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would actually limit gas
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it limits gas exchange, of course,
it would limit transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would also limit photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the issue was, now, if you're lucky
enough, by spraying this kind of compound
[SPEAKER_01]: on the targeted canopy, we would be able
to get either stomatal closure or some
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering of the transpiration,
which would also go with a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, well, we did some
preliminary testing on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, for example, when you see this is
a seasonal net carbon exchange rate trend,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was actually inherent to another
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this arrow here indicates the timing
of the pinoline spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you spray, you do see that there
is an immediate effect on photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which actually gets lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, it stays lower for a fairly
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because here, the problem is that you need
to limit photosynthesis, but you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: have also a high duration of this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you limit photosynthesis for a
week, and then maybe the compound is
[SPEAKER_01]: washed off, that's not enough to induce
the source limitation we are aiming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very happy when we did that in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fairly recent paper published on
the Australian Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, this is the trend I would like to
draw your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, first spray here, flowering is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First spray here, second spray here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after basically the first and the
second spray, you would see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis was limited by more than
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of limitation lasted for
almost 40 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is interesting, because that means
that the compound is able to significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: limit photosynthesis, and the duration of
this limiting effect is high enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, to provide the kind of source
limitation you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the issue was, why not using this
kind of treatment in order to simulate the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of the leaf removal?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it works, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you just need to tell the grower
that he has to spray with the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, as he's doing a spray against
pests, and he's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, this is a trial
we did, again, on San Giovese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that we work a lot on San Giovese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you see, so control versus spray
versus treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this particular case, we did not
see any significant effect on berry
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not really surprising,
because when you spray, OK, you get most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the limiting effect, let's say,
10 days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the limitation in photosynthesis is
across 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the source limitation is not very
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not really able to affect
fruit set.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, since the limitation lasts a lot,
I mean, at least 45 days over the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would see that the berry weight was
very much decreased in all years over the
[SPEAKER_01]: treated vines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That accounts, of course, for the loser
clusters again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, it was increased breaks and
increased color and phenolics in two out
[SPEAKER_01]: of three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least for the phenolics in two out of
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the anthocyanins, it was higher
here, higher here, similar here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it basically can work depending,
of course, on the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it should be pre-flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the concentration, the advised
concentration is close to 2% of active
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to spray at least twice in
order to allow more time for the effect to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop over the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are several advantages,
because first of all, you do not risk to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause direct damage to the clusters as you
would risk if you use a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a high flexibility, because you
can decide to spray the whole canopy or
[SPEAKER_01]: just part of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, once the product is
washed off by rain and other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf tissues go back to the normal
photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a recovery, which is really
possible, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sort of underline this sentence
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Source is limited, yet macroclimate is not
altered.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in some climates, removing leaves
can be any way dangerous, because you need
[SPEAKER_01]: actually some cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, you leave the leaves on,
and you just reduce their function.
[SPEAKER_01]: But physically, the leaves stay on the
same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fairly important in terms of
flexibility versus different environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, psychology and viticulture
goes very close, because if you tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that they just need to spray and
nothing else, you say, hey, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now at this point, what about the
direct comparison of the two techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have seen that a main purpose
of this kind of technique is to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my recommendation for using this kind
of leaf removal is actually if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: high-yielding vineyard with big clusters,
compact clusters, that is your case.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a low-yielding vineyard with
loose clusters already, just do not use
[SPEAKER_01]: it, because it's basically negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, we need to understand what's the
case study we want to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point, if the traditional,
if the early leaf remover is a technique
[SPEAKER_01]: to reduce yield, can we compare that
technique with a traditional technique
[SPEAKER_01]: like cluster thinning and see what
happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to go very fast to the main
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, control, early cluster thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, it was a cluster thinning made at
the same time when early leaf removal was
[SPEAKER_01]: made in order to have a uniform
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late cluster thinning, which means
basically pre-variation, traditional late
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster thinning, and this is a
defoliation treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you look at the, of course,
for example, some of the yield components,
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the defoliated vines,
you had, as expected, lower cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: weight, whereas in the thinned,
cluster thinned vines, you had a tendency
[SPEAKER_01]: at having heavier clusters, as usually
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, okay, you go from 7.5%
kilos per vine in the control treatment to
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.2 or 4.1 in the two thinning treatments,
and you have five in the defoliated
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a statistical difference
between yield levels across treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that if you compare the
quality in terms of, I mean, soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: solids, phenolics, color, you would see
that there is basically no difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between these three treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that means that in this particular
case, I can reduce crop, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: by only, you know, would be 25% or
something, retaining the same quality I do
[SPEAKER_01]: have if I reduce crop more with cluster
thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea that the more you reduce the
crop, the higher the quality, does not
[SPEAKER_01]: work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does not work in many cases,
according to my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why I like always to show this
kind of picture where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we imply that there is a negative
relationship between quality and yield per
[SPEAKER_01]: actor, we, you know, although,
of course, it's a joke saying that no crop
[SPEAKER_01]: best quality, but I don't think that this
relationship holds in many cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm actually heading towards how
much time do you have still?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 minutes?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes is exactly what I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the second part of the talk would be
shorter, but it's gonna be the other
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be the apical to the
clusters late leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why we do that, or we tried at least
doing that, you know, in Italy,
[SPEAKER_01]: in many regions, we do have the issue of a
too fast ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grapes ripen too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michaela comes from Tuscany.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Tuscany, in many seasons, you go out in
the vineyard, mid of August, you sample
[SPEAKER_01]: berries for breaks, and you already have
14 alcohol, mid August.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, of course,
you do not have the color you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have the phenolics you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really need to find solution
trying to, you know, make the sugaring
[SPEAKER_01]: process a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we don't want to
delay also the color and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not, of course, very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was actually using a technique
which was again supposed to impose a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific and calibrated source limitation
at the given point of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the goal here is totally
different from the early leaf removal
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you remember, the early leaf removal
usually improves and enhances grape
[SPEAKER_01]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we want to go to the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to achieve a delay in
ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, not an enhancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we basically need to make a
reasoning which is actually the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: of the one we make when we apply the early
leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, I mean, from the
physiology of the grapevine, we do know
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a look at this graph here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is leaf assimilation versus time in
the grapevine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would notice that from variation
onward, the apical part of the shoot is
[SPEAKER_01]: the part assuring the highest
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is normal because those leaves are
not too old, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are feeling mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they work very hard in terms of
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about if we are at a given point,
we remove by purpose, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those apical good leaves in order
to slow down the ripening process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to be faster now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, when we do have this kind of
hypothesis, the things that we like to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually having also a more applied
basic physiological study in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe starting with a field
study, with a longer-term field study in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to have a confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, what you need to do is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, you open up a window
at, let's say, variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remove some leaves in the apical part
of the canopy where the good leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: located at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can do that before
variation or after variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The height of this window can be variable
depending on the kind of effect you would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to induce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very quickly, this was the seasonal net
carbon exchange rate for the three
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's fairly common that you
see, once you have applied the treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see this is our specific rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our assimilation rate per leaf array
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are actually comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see that there is a reaction to
the removal of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a compensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that the photosynthetic rate would
actually increase in the remaining leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: of the removed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me go through right away to the
ripening pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we wanted to set, let's say,
a given ripening level, which in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case, we were working on potted vines,
so some limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set basically 18 breaks as a
reasonable level of ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do see that when we harvested the
control vines, they had 18.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the duty-full-heated
treatments were lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is according to our expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most interesting part is that when
we look at the color and phenolics,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were no differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that means that the potential of the
technique to actually reduce the pace in
[SPEAKER_01]: the accumulation of sugar without
affecting the color and the phenolics is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very promising at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, can we mechanize this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this case, I must say that
mechanization is particularly easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because can you imagine having the goal of
removing leaves from this part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy where you do not have clusters,
for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a free part of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you tell the driver to run
through the rows and doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: job, he's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he speeds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pushes the accelerator, because there
are no clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with two passes per row, you're
actually able to open up a window which is
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately half a meter high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should do that basically when the
average breaks concentration of your
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes is across 12, 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, at that particular stage,
with that setting, it's highly probable
[SPEAKER_01]: that you would get a significant delay in
the sugaring process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the field data are fairly interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, again, another recent paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was published, again, of the
Australian Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see control versus defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are actually the ground means over
years, two years of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, there was a
significant delay in breaks, whereas the
[SPEAKER_01]: color and the phenolics were not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that this is a huge effect,
but it goes into the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the right direction is to decouple
possibly the sugar process versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: color and the phenolic accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the grapevine, this is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you have the soft,
translucent berry, and you measure breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: on that berry, you already have eight
breaks, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the color shows up at least five,
six days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, the coloring process is
delayed versus the sugaring process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're trying to make the reverse with
this kind of technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the end of the story is that at that
point, again, you don't want to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine, although in this case it's very
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost funny, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you, again, use antitranspirant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of actually applying the
antitranspirant to the basal part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, you apply the antitranspirant on
the top part of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you want to make sure that
you get some significant effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply the antitranspirant on the top
two-thirds of the canopy without actually
[SPEAKER_01]: treating the clusters, which I would not
recommend doing that, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a paper which also was awarded for
the best paper in the American Journal a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it shows that it can be
done, as you would notice here,
[SPEAKER_01]: although you would say that, again,
on a two-year basis, there was indeed a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant decrease in sugar,
although in this particular case there was
[SPEAKER_01]: a mild decrease also in color and
phenolics, probably because the limitation
[SPEAKER_01]: in that particular case was a bit too
strong as compared to what was our
[SPEAKER_01]: expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, basically it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at the wine company,
the composition also, it seems clear that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were actually able to reduce the
alcohol at the end by one degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the problem of having
excessive alcohol in the wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: my personal opinion is try to solve the
problem in the vineyard instead of trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to solve the problem in the winery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably safer and wiser at a given
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is basically all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I used probably most of the time,
and so I will be very glad to catch a few
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have done is to create a
source-limited situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obtaining a source-limited situation
in the vine doesn't reach its full yield
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the objective here is to decrease
the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, is it possible to directly
manipulate through sap by using rose
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators so that you keep the sort of,
you know, largely keep the source side,
[SPEAKER_02]: you reduce the number of berries per
cluster to solve the problem of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cluster too tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know the answer better than I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure about that, but I give you
my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, when I said you
should use this technique when you add to
[SPEAKER_01]: the vineyard, you have an over-cropping
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tribiano vineyard usually crops more
than 20 tons per actor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at that point, limiting yield is
what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking with Alan these days about
this technique, and he was actually making
[SPEAKER_01]: a very wise comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, okay, now let's put the case that
you do have a need of limiting yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know that you are in an area like
maybe this area where you might have very
[SPEAKER_01]: bad weather right after flowering or fruit
sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you would have maybe a
farther reduction in fruit sap due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: limited conditions, and maybe your yield
would go too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do not use this if you have,
let's say, a really already balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you have the aim of really getting
looser clusters in a very thick cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinot Noir, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't crop too much in Pinot Noir,
but in Pinot Noir, this has worked very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: About the use of growth regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Italy, there has been a lot of work on
gibberellas.
[SPEAKER_01]: GA3 is sprayed in many ways, many
treatments and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say that it basically did not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not work because there is an effect
in many cases, although you know that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to spray low dosage, very low,
in order to avoid next year bad surprises
[SPEAKER_01]: on the value reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the problem was that spraying,
let's say, similar concentrations of the
[SPEAKER_01]: similar findings every season would end up
having a lot of variability in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: effects on the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it's not the standard thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I'm not aware of any
other compound used for specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing fruit sap in this particular
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have tried with, you know,
copper spray at very high concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: and the kind of things, but I do not see
enough evidence for saying that is
[SPEAKER_01]: unreliable to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check in with Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned the leaves are important
supply of carbon, but until bloom to set,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've still got reserves that typically
are providing some, although they're
[SPEAKER_03]: bottoming out around bloom to set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you looked at the reserves and with
the depoliation, do you see some
[SPEAKER_03]: additional use of reserves or have you
looked at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we have done some surveys on the
carbohydrate storage in the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a couple of cases, we did not see any
specific effect on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, actually, the amount of storage
capacity that the vine has early in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season may have, of course, a sort of
interfering effect on the leaf removal
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you'll have the same
intensity of the treatment, so you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: remove only six leaves in a fairly,
you know, maybe in your train young vine
[SPEAKER_01]: with not a lot of reserves, maybe versus a
spoon pruned cordon vine, 15 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some instances, it might happen that
over the first year you apply the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, you don't see a great deal of
effect because there is a buffering,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, interference because,
again, you apply this great source
[SPEAKER_01]: limitation because when you apply that
kind of treatment, the photosynthesis on
[SPEAKER_01]: the shoot basis is reduced by 70%
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, being that kind of
source limitation, there is a likely
[SPEAKER_01]: re-translocation of reserves, of
assimilates from reserve storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you do this and you don't see a
lot of effect the first year, think in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of possible interfering effect of
some storage booms which are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: activated when induced that source
limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is indeed true that if you repeat the
same treatment the next season,
[SPEAKER_01]: very likely you would not have been seeing
a significant effect because the
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology is very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you apply a significant source
limitation, you would see a significant or
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, you know, fairly high decreasing
fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there is a variability
depending on conditions or the vine age or
[SPEAKER_01]: the variety, but basically the principle
is very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one super quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you contrast what you're showing
here to mechanical fitting of flusters?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we do not have a comparison with
mechanical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fitting was hand fitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, mechanical fitting I meant instead
of trying to, yeah, so the hand fitting,
[SPEAKER_04]: so you had to control that with hand
fitting where you're actually raking out
[SPEAKER_04]: berries by hand as opposed to using a
source limitation to achieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, as I show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was the original slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can follow up with you later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a comparison though to actual
mechanically removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not with mechanically removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all made by hand in that specific
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hand with removal and thinning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I've seen for example,
in some regions they use of cones to try
[SPEAKER_04]: to get within a cluster partial movement
of berries, not cluster thinning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to have to wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
