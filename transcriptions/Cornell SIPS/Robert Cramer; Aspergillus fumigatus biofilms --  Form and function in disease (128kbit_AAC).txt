[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Lori, and the department for
having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first time over to Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed my drive over yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was telling Lori, I don't get a lot
of time alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the six hour drive actually was
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe how warm it was when I
got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so we're going to talk about
Aspergillus today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know perhaps maybe an organism that you
don't hear a lot about here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was a card-carrying plant
pathologist at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had fun pulling this paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my very first paper I published as
a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked on this in the late 90s using a
technique that the students probably don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know what it is anymore, random
amplified polymorphic DNA markers,
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at the genetic diversity of
Fusarium exisperma isolates, isolated from
[SPEAKER_01]: common bean and sugar beets in the Central
High Plains region, which is Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: Wyoming, and Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big part of my graduate
school work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved on, and we did some
functional genomics analyses in this
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting interaction between
Alternaria Brassica and Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I thought was really exciting
about this work was the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternaria was an actual primary pathogen
of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike early days, some of the systems
that were being worked on at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought that was a nice
introduction into how these Brassica
[SPEAKER_01]: causing, these diseases of Brassica plants
were being mediated by the Alternaria
[SPEAKER_01]: genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, grad students, we use things
called express sequence tags back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you probably don't know what those
are either anymore, thankfully,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can do things like RNA-seq
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why am I here, and what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the students and post-docs
go, I'm happy to talk about how I ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: switching into human fungal pathogenesis
during my post-doc at lunch, if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we asked, very similar
questions to what you ask when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to understand how fungi cause
disease of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that reason is because
antifungal therapies are not effective in
[SPEAKER_01]: a significant proportion of patients that
have these invasive fungal infections,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like fungal pathogen of plants cause
significant crop losses throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, despite use of antifungals and
other management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these organisms remain a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a big thing for our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most of you, when you woke up this
morning, you probably weren't thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about getting an infection by a fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first was introduced to that
fact that fungi might cause disease in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans, as a graduate student,
when I made the switch, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not something, fortunately,
most of us grow up worrying about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so recently, the World Health
Organization, though, has recognized now
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi as a critical group of pathogens to
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in 2022, the WHO came out with
their critical priority group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the organism that we work on we're
going to talk about today, Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: humegatus, is the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see Canada albicans and Canada
auris.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are yeasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cryptococcus is a fascinating fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a basidiomycete, but it also is a
yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why did the WHO suddenly,
in 2022, become interested in these
[SPEAKER_01]: infections?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because medicine has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world has changed dramatically
with climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as advances in immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of the chronic diseases that
we treat in the clinic now, the therapies
[SPEAKER_01]: we use to treat those diseases,
target the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're seeing is an increase in
infections caused by these fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as plant pathologists, you know,
these fungi are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet we only, you know, not only,
but we see predominantly these four
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms showing up in these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something unique about their
biology that allows them to cause disease
[SPEAKER_01]: in them a million times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not just the only one of the
five chemicals that are in the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: billion host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly, Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the screen's a little bit
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of a delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus was discovered in 1729.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to talk about it's named
after the Aspergillum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any Catholics in the audience,
that's the Holy Water sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see the knidiafore,
which is the asexual development structure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the organism, looks just like the
aspergillum.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a priest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go, aspergillus is the genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fumigatus is Latin for smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a culture of aspergillus
fumigatus grown in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this green coloration here is the
knidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from a molecule called DHN
melanin that actually happens to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: virulence factor for the organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: But importantly, those knidia are coated
in hydrophobin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those hydrophobins make the organism,
the knidia, very hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they disperse into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take a plate of aspergillus
and you just open the lid, you see smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it got its name,
fumigatus, for smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes a pretty broad spectrum of
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to talk about invasive
aspergillus today, which is a systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But chronic aspergillus is increasing in
frequency now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many manifestations of
aspergillus that relate to what's called a
[SPEAKER_01]: TH2 type response or allergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an organism that causes a very
wide spectrum of human disease in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different patient populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a CT scan from a patient at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital over in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's from one of the patients of my
collaborator, Dr. Tobias Holt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm trying to illustrate on this
slide is the aspergillus one is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pulmonary pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in red, you can see one of these
lesions forming in this patient's lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crux of the matter is that our
optimal antifungal therapies, which aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: that effective in vivo, have to target the
organism in the right physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our field, that's actually a
significant challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you actually identify
infection microenvironment relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutics?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe a bit of a spoiler for later in
the talk, but the way we've done this in
[SPEAKER_01]: our field for years, and as plant
pathologists, you do this too when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to inoculate a plant with an organism,
is there's a big bottleneck here to get
[SPEAKER_01]: these morbidity and survival curves or
plant death curves with our mutant fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the result you want to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you make a fungal mutant using fungal
genetic approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hope that mutant doesn't cause
disease in your animal or your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get this beautiful survival curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get papers and grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've identified a drug target.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with this is that what is
often the case is to get a curve like
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you fail to initiate an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these mutants tend to be very sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are incapable of initiating that
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the agricultural setting,
that could be very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could easily develop something you
could spray on crops, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: to prevent spore germination or prevent
the development of an apresoria that
[SPEAKER_01]: initiates the infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a mammalian system, we can't
predict who's going to get one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so prophylactic therapies are a less
viable alternative for developing new
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutics for these diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens is the individual gets an
infection that's been established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wrote a little piece on this,
just talking about the importance of these
[SPEAKER_01]: high impact virulence factors,
which are important for initiation of an
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really unclear in almost every case,
because we don't really have the great
[SPEAKER_01]: tools to look at an established infection,
we're not sure if they're disease
[SPEAKER_01]: progression factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is what you'd really want to
target.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get sick, you go to the doctor
after you get sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to treat these infections in a
different context than we often are
[SPEAKER_01]: studying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how we approach this in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the ways is we've gone in to
try and profile the infection
[SPEAKER_01]: microenvironment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an old experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the last ones I did as a
postdoc, with this idea in mind to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what the physiology of the
fungus was in an established infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bit of a busy slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 1H NMR spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have animals that were
inoculated with saline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then animals where we give Aspergillus
the knidia through the airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just inhale the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just inhale the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the lung, what we did is you
can actually get fluid out of the lung,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the BAL, bronchial algal vage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can take that fluid,
and we did metabolomics on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the surprise was that these red arrows
are metabolites associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation, particularly ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lactate, alanine, acetate, those are
all metabolites that likely are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't rule out that the fungus is
making those in vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ethanol we knew had to be coming
from the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really was the piece of data
that I started my lab on because the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: was is that when do microbes ferment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ferment when oxygen becomes limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might be thinking, well,
wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about an obligate aerobic
filamentous fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're telling me that it's
fermenting, and it grows in the absence of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen, or at least with limited oxygen
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would argue that Aspergillus and a
lot of our filamentous fungi that we study
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the soil, they're really good at
recycling carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most of them, that's their ecological
role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in compost piles, it's the number one
place where we could go out and get
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental isolates of Aspergillus
humegatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you turn over your compost pile and
you see the smoke come out the spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of those are humegatus for a couple
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it's thermal tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the few thermal tolerant
filamentous fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can survive up to temperatures of 70
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can grow in the lab at temperatures at
55 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rare for the molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, if you go to your garden store,
what do they try and sell?
[SPEAKER_01]: They try and sell you devices to oxygenate
your compost to speed up microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism to degrade the compost faster,
which tells you that composts become
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen depleted very rapidly due to
microbial metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Aspergillus, it turns out, even though
it's an obligate aerobic, it will not grow
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobically, but it can live
anaerobically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It loves to grow in these low oxygen
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we ended up finding, at first no
one believed us, but the ethanol data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we went and showed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used a tool from cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cancer, hypoxia or oxygen deficiency
is a really important part of the tumor
[SPEAKER_01]: that confers drug resistance to a lot of
cancer therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as tumors develop, they become hypoxic
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's tools to investigate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we showed, this is a lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Aspergillus came in through the
airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green is Aspergillus growing out in
the lung tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red, now, is showing you a region
of the lung that's deficient in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called pimidizole hydrochloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: It forms protein adducts on thiol residues
only when oxygen levels drop below 1.5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the site of infection, just like in
a compost pile, the organism is having to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with these low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an important point here is that hypoxia
was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for
[SPEAKER_01]: how mammals, another obligate aerobe,
how they respond and sense oxygen levels
[SPEAKER_01]: through the HIF-1 alpha pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really beautiful science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a really cool mechanism related to
polio hydroxylase, which uses oxygen as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cofactor to hydroxylate HIF-1 when oxygen
is abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when it drops, you don't get the
protein hydroxylation and the
[SPEAKER_01]: transcription factors can go activate the
hypoxia response.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and I think this is relevant for
plant pathology, is oxygen demand hypoxia
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs, the physiological response,
when oxygen demand exceeds the supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can occur at any oxygen level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when different fungi induce a
hypoxia response really depends on their
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen requirements and their oxygen
levels in a given environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we studied this for years,
a lot of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found this transcription factor called
SRBA that, as you can see, when you make a
[SPEAKER_01]: null mutant, it cannot grow in hypoxia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the dream result.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I ended up getting the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gene that I love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to study it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it abolishes hypoxia fitness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It completely abolishes virulence of the
organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing here, I'm not showing you
the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, not showing you the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this actually does initiate an
infection, this mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once the hypoxia sends in,
then the mutant stops growing completely
[SPEAKER_01]: in the animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The animals are all able to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually do have a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of our latest paper looking at
how to target this pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a gift that kept on giving because
the azoles are the main antifungal that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use in the clinic, just like in
agriculture for antifungal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the aspergillus wild type
strain here is completely resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: azoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this azole, voriconazole, it's
susceptible to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the primary therapy in the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get one of these infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our mutant was susceptible to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vuconazole, which is used to treat yeast
infections, and then the azole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So virulence, drug susceptibility,
it was the best gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to throw, again, this seems to
happen in plant fungal pathogenesis as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the fermentation pathway in
Fusarium that was shown by a group in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain to be really important for causing
Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was exciting, which suggests that,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are the roots full of oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually pretty oxygen deficient,
especially when they get waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of these root pathogens in
particular must have to deal with low
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen environments and able to thrive
within a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in Magna Porta, Wong Hong Lee's
group actually ended up studying SRVA in
[SPEAKER_01]: Magna Porta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And show that Magna Porta, as it
penetrates through the apisora,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium also experiences an oxygen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a GRC once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nick Talbot was giving one of his
amazing talks looking in the tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: watching Magna Porta invade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was losing GFP signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you're losing oxygen as you get
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: GFPs requires oxygen to sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was all fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have talked to you all day about
SRVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to find that we had evidence
to suggest that there were other
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory pathways that were dealing with
the response to oxygen in the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've talked to quite a few people
this morning about RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Laurie's teaching the class,
asking you students that are in the class
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at an RNA-seq and pull genes out,
make a hypothesis, and hopefully find a
[SPEAKER_01]: gene that's related to a specific function
in phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work that often, I hate to tell
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn a lot from RNA-seq
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But often, the gene that's at the top of
your list isn't the one that's driving the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through that with low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up deciding to let the fungus
tell us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short, how we came about
this is we started screening environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: and clinical isolates, another tip for
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of genetic heterogeneity
within the organism that you study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we often study reference strains
for many years in our respective fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of cool genetic
diversity out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do screens without having to do
any kind of recombinant DNA experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go get a bunch of isolates and screen
for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with genome sequencing,
as cheap as it is, you can actually track
[SPEAKER_01]: down the mutations that are causative in
many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was our idea here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set up an experiment, an evolution
experiment, with a clinical isolate that
[SPEAKER_01]: really struggled to grow in low oxygen
environments compared to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other strains that we had looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up passaging the organism for
about four months under low oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We passage the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect the whole population in each
passage to try and avoid bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kept passaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up, this experiment just kind
of has taken the lab in a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: direction than one that we were previously
working on, which is one of the fun things
[SPEAKER_01]: about science is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you might expect, we did recover a
strain that became more fit under the low
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the goal of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're following along, you might
predict that the strain is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if low oxygen environment is important
for progressing disease, I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't say pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say virulent, a little bit more
virulent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to cause the disease is the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the progression of the disease was
increased more rapidly, potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: because the strain is a little bit more
fit in that low oxygen environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unexpected part that threw us for a
loop was this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look, here's the strain that we
passage, the parental strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like in standard lab
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the strain that resulted from the
experiment evolution experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you can see the substantial
change in the colony morphology of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was interesting to us is that the
other condition where irrespective of the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution changes colony morphology is low
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the low oxygen environment is one
environmental condition where we see these
[SPEAKER_01]: morphological changes within the colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really became curious about if
this adaptation to the low oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: environment was being driven by the change
in colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this causative or was it correlative?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really dove in and started to
investigate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, we had to
quantify the morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up quantifying the amount
of a colony that is vegetative,
[SPEAKER_01]: so not undergoing asexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one thing that was repeatable was
the development of these furrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these colonies that were coming out of
low oxygen always furrowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this rugose colony, the mycology term
is a rugose colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly, if you look in the
literature, there hasn't been a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: in bacteria, there's been a lot of work
done associating different colony
[SPEAKER_01]: morphotypes with pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the fungi, less so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, functional or just coincidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conceptual switch here for us was
that really starting to think about these
[SPEAKER_01]: colonies as communities and that the
structure of the community likely is
[SPEAKER_01]: driving the emergent properties that arise
when you have a community of cells
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the end of the day now,
we started referring to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mycology, the term is a mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And functionally, in the bacterial world,
they call these biofilms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're communities of cells attached
to a surface that produce an extracellular
[SPEAKER_01]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm showing you here is in
these colonies of molds, this isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive to Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other molds do this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make this beautiful extracellular
matrix that helps connect these colonies
[SPEAKER_01]: and these filaments together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by any definition, these mold
colonies are a biofilm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, going back to that CT scan,
thinking about the physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in the host that we need to
treat, well, here's an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a picture now of Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Josh?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: During his PhD, he developed this
technique in our lab called FunPak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to clear tissue and then look
at the fungus within the tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus, after it initiates infection,
when you're progressing the disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what you have to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is these biofilms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're geared to the lung tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you have to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suddenly, we're like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've maybe been studying this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often look at the stress response by
inoculating canidia onto a plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is the stress response to the
antifungal killing the canidia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it actually impacting the hyphae?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be hard to parse that apart by
using spot dilution assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this led to a lot of questions for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, what can biofilm morphology tell
us about the evolutionary pressures faced
[SPEAKER_01]: by aspergillus in the environment in the
host?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do these population-level
scale morphotypes relate to specific
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic states that we care about,
like virulence, drug susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then persistence within a human host
or a plant host?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the antifungal
genetics by training and love genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are the genetic mechanisms
that facilitate the biofilm form and
[SPEAKER_01]: function?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then home run would be to identify
small molecules that target these
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our current antifungals are really
ineffective against the biofilm state of
[SPEAKER_01]: the organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of hammer home this point
that the environment, thinking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary pressures the organisms face,
when we grow aspergillus in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reality is we're growing it in a
condition it does not really face much in
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not see 21% oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know that because it canidates
the moment you drop it on a plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So canidiation generally is a stress
response in filamentous fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is oxygen dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light and oxygen make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dark, no oxygen, growing
vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you come to the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you want to release your
propagules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in low oxygen environments,
we get this induction of these rugose
[SPEAKER_01]: colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an incubator to completely
shield out light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get these colonies that are
completely rugose, producing very little
[SPEAKER_01]: spores in response to the low oxygen
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the strain that we evolved,
we ended up calling H more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it resembled the low oxygen
colonies of the wild type strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason we gave it a specific name
is the H morph colonies, here's an example
[SPEAKER_01]: right here, they do this when oxygen is
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they look like the low oxygen colonies
in the presence of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the quantitation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an H morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So N morph strains can switch between the
two different morphotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But H morph are locked into this rugose
colony-like state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some other ways we've quantified
this biofilm morphotype convince you that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the delay between my computer and
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get to next,
you need quantitative data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we looked at,
we can use confocal microscopy to set up
[SPEAKER_01]: these submerged biofilm cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing about these cultures now is
we don't get asexual reproduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we don't see in vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these filaments, they look a lot more
like that image Josh took from the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've kind of really moved heavily into
using this model as a way to study mold
[SPEAKER_01]: biology now in the context of infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But quickly, H morph N morph, you should
see some difference how the hyphae are
[SPEAKER_01]: orienting themselves within the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're looking at over here is
quantification of the angle of departure
[SPEAKER_01]: of each hyphae within the biofilm from the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so H morph hyphae are growing more
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the delay here, I'm a little
worried these move out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the N morph biofilms, you get this
really distinctive colony biofilms where
[SPEAKER_01]: the hyphae grow vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the hypotheses we have in the
lab right now is that is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: arotaxis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're hoping to figure out what the
oxygen sensor is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it actually arotaxis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or could the other nutrient gradients that
are forming that are driving this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's our favorite hypothesis right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look at the H morph
colonies now, hopefully right away,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see there's a lot more space
between the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as this thing starts to rotate,
hopefully you can start to see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: hyphae are growing longer before they
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow more horizontally, which helps
create that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the hypothesis here is these
strains now are able to, since there's
[SPEAKER_01]: more mass diffusion capable, since you
have more space between the hyphae,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gradients that develop being are less
steep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have more access to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have more access to other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you quantify biomass in these
strains, these guys always grow more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They generate more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to go through all the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably wondering what happened
in the evolution experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened is we found a fungal
specific gene that was unstudied in the
[SPEAKER_01]: subthelomeric region of chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my student's worst nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: An unknown, unstudied gene that's only in
the aspergillus genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good news was it was clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very clean experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were three other SNPs that were high
impact after four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one was the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has a nuclear localization
signal, which I'm going to show you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this one domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The secondary structure is a beta alpha
beta beta alpha beta motif, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleic acid binding domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was in a gene cluster that pops
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard Emil was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right, Emil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with Emil on this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in this gene cluster in the
subthelomeric region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it HAC for hypoxia-associated
cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems to be a regulator of the
cluster, because if we knock this gene
[SPEAKER_01]: out, the other genes in the cluster,
their expression turns off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The allele itself, that arose,
the allele is both necessary and
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can take the evolved allele,
put it into wild type strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we get this beautiful rugose morphol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also can just take the wild type
allele, which is silenced in the wild type
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that we worked on, and overexpress
it at an ectopic location, and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful morphology itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened with the allele,
the allele actually increased the
[SPEAKER_01]: expression levels of what this gene is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be transcript stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be increased translation rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you increase the levels of this gene
called HRMA now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You induce expression of all the genes in
the cluster, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out there's another gene that
we're working on with Emil that was
[SPEAKER_01]: annotated in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cool biology in these
fungal genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't necessarily believe the annotation
you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys use FungiDB, take your genome
sequence, use RNA-seq, load it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find all kinds of new genes that
are not annotated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a new gene every day in our genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night, I just scroll through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, yeah, there's a new gene
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guarantee you will find new genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's Emil's stuff that we're working
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just submitted this paper with Emil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it turns out that gene cluster is
on one of these giant starship elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the paper here shows that we found a
lineage of aspergillus where the cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: is moving, which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know where the genes come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clearly are recently evolved within
the lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't look like they're bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of cool stories about
subthelomere gene expansion and parasites,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malaria, the reason you don't have a
malaria vaccine is because subthelomere
[SPEAKER_01]: antigen variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all occurs in the subthelomere region
of malaria parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just keep generating new antigenic
variants with these new genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a cool Candida story from
Brendan Cormack's group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Candida glabrata were the subthelomere
region controlled adherence to surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more about HRMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes around the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's in the nucleolus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the beautiful localization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have that signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we did is we knocked out the
nuclear localization signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protein's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not showing you the Western blot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get rid of the colony morphology if
this protein cannot get to that nucleolus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's driving the phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the title of my talk was a little bit
provocative, cancer-like metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you that H-morph occurs when
oxygen's around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one piece of data that we got,
which was really fascinating to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that even though aspergillus is
obligate aerob, this is the parent strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're looking at here is the ability
of a biofilm to consume oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see very rapidly aspergillus
consumes all the oxygen that's available
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's within the biofilm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungus itself is inducing a hypoxic
microenvironment in its colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's our evolved 20-string,
which is growing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's producing more biomass, if you
remember from that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet it consumes less oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a disconnect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we kind of started thinking
about cancer a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the major challenges, though,
the difference between a cancer cell and a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal cell is all this matrix and this
polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fungi make this huge cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have cell walls around ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungi are secreting this out into the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's a TEM image of the parental
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that beautiful cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's matrix on the outside of the cell
wall now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our H-morph strains, you can see the
cell wall is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the matrix is balling up outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it still produces the matrix,
but it secretes it away from itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be important in pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know it's secreting it away because
we can stain for beta-glucan, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: what most of this electron translucent
layer is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a probe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called DECTIN-1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a pattern recognition receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in your immune system that detects
fungal beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like plants, plants have pattern
recognition receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chitin's a great one in the plant
fungal pathogenesis literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the beta-glucan receptor in
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tag a fluorophore to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it binds beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can quantify how much exposure you
have with beta-glucan on your fungal cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consistent with that, we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have more beta-glucan
exposed, the immune system is going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it more and hyperreact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually think that that's
what's driving the increased disease
[SPEAKER_01]: progression with these H-morph strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computer's really slow.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So host damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with these H-morph strains,
so this is an assay where you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at tissue damage based on release of an
enzyme when it sells lice in your tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's the wild-type strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungus is in the airway,
the parental strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that black is the aspergillus crawling
as a biofilm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the purple, those are neutrophils
that are coming trying to kill the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at our H-morph strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus is spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole other part of the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the biofilm morphology in vivo and
in vitro actually plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get those tight teeth like we do
in the wild-type.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually all spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here, look at these airways,
completely full of neutrophils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think that's being driven by the
beta-glucan, which is a hyperinducing
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the animals here basically can't
breathe from these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is it doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the metabolic challenge here for these
organisms is to make this cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've done recently is a
metabolomics experiment comparing H-morph
[SPEAKER_01]: to N-morph fungal metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the H-morph strains, anything in red
is basically gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're seeing here is an
increase in pentose phosphate pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because that's where
you get a lot of NADPH from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm going to show you in a minute,
to make a fungal cell wall, you need a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of NADPH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I showed you earlier when oxygen's
low, aspergillus, ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we think is happening here is the
glucose is flying through glycolysis to
[SPEAKER_01]: generate reducing power, as well as
intermediates that are needed to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: cell wall when oxygen is limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason these H-morph strains have
more beta-glucan is because you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: take glucose 6-phosphate and shunt it over
to beta-glucan in a couple steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a little bit of NADPH,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like one enzyme here, one here,
and one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really simple molecule to make,
relatively speaking, for a fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tough one is chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chitin's essential for fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes glutamine, acetyl-CoA,
a ton of NADPH, multiple steps,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the formation of UDP-glucanac,
which is important for epigenetic
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, all other parts of fungal
biology, to make this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a ton of reducing equivalents and
carbon that are needed to make a molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus makes galactomanin,
which is part of the matrix that it
[SPEAKER_01]: secretes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, multiple steps requiring NADPH,
all coming off of fructose 6-phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have a competition to make
chitin or galactomanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the main polymer of the matrix is
this molecule called GAG, which requires
[SPEAKER_01]: UDP-glucanac from, Gal-NAC from
UDP-glucanac.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, really a lot of pressure being
placed on this molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can form this extracellular matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how does an organism do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when there's plenty of oxygen,
there's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in these H-morph strains, where oxygen
is apparently limiting, they found a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the cool things that fungi
apparently can do is they can do reductive
[SPEAKER_01]: carboxylation in the TCA cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to run the TCA cycle in reverse to
generate that reducing power that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when this happens,
alpha-ketoglutarate gets carboxylated to
[SPEAKER_01]: isocitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets converted to citrate,
which goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be converted to acetyl-CoA,
which you need for the chitin
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the key trick here that tipped us off
that this was a cancer-like metabolism was
[SPEAKER_01]: this molecule right here,
2-hydroxyglutarate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is produced in cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't seen it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that molecule told us is that in
these H-morph strains, the TCA cycle is
[SPEAKER_01]: running in reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think it's running in reverse to
generate NADPH and the intermediates
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to make a cell wall when oxygen is
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool mechanism in order to
maintain a structure that you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing is you get a ton of NAD
to keep glycolysis going in that process
[SPEAKER_01]: too, which is absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of you may have heard about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the cancer model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Warburg effect was discovered in
1924 by Otto Warburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is high rates of glycolysis in the
presence of oxygen from mammalian cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing in how this exactly works,
people are still working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge area of cancer research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it provides intermediates to make
lipids and nucleotides in mammalian cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the fungus, we think it's providing
the intermediates to make the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these H-morph strains are having a
Warburg-like metabolism in response to an
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question then becomes,
that is not answered in the cancer field,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we don't have the answer either in
fungi, but maybe we can get there,
[SPEAKER_01]: why the cells get locked in this
physiological state?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they stay this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they just flip back to regular
metabolism?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of support for that model.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually take these H-morph strains
and you put them on media that are forced
[SPEAKER_01]: to use respiration instead of glycolysis,
we completely can change the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we completely flip the morphology back
to the wild-type flat colony morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lori, I went into the seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may be asking, does this matter in
vivo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I showed you the H-morph strain,
so glycolytic intermediates.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Josh's white whale during his
PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd argue about this in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a decent amount of literature
saying that those respiratory carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sources that drive respiration were
probably the main carbon source in vivo
[SPEAKER_01]: for Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our whole model would kind of be a mess
and not relevant to what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lung if that was the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh was convinced there was glycolytic
intermediates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before he left the lab,
he made this mutant called PFKA,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphofructose kinase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it can't grow on glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it grows a little bit on lactate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it on the slide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows fine on protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows fine on acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows fine on glycerol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great mutant to test his
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, unfortunately, came and joined
Lori's lab before he was able to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you the new PhD student was
really excited because the PFKA mutant
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot initiate infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the interpretation of this experiment
is that glycolytic intermediates are,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, driving in vivo fungal initiation of
the infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this glycolytic metabolism is essential
for Aspergillus to progress disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get one more paper out of your PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this isn't a lab artifact.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different clinical isolates that
we've recovered now from a B-cell
[SPEAKER_01]: malignancy patient, a patient with cystic
fibrosis, a patient with pulmonary
[SPEAKER_01]: invasive Aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the really nice H-morph
morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is coming out of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, if you go to the literature,
1975, you can see the first example of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these are two different
patients, two isolates from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's H-morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know because genome sequencing
didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back then, if these are related.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have data now from patients at
Dartmouth where we get isolates from the
[SPEAKER_01]: same patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all isolates from one
patient, different colony morphologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is very H-morph-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all related.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a couple hundred SNPs between
these four colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in vivo, adapting this H-morph-like
physiology, which, again, we think is
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the low oxygen environment
found in the tissue, just provides a way
[SPEAKER_01]: for the fungus to maintain viability to
make its cell wall when it's missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think here's about 12 patients that
we've looked at with cystic fibrosis that
[SPEAKER_01]: are infected with Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see H-morph isolates in pink here
in almost all the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these tend to be arising in vivo in
response to a low oxygen environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned to you guys early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily need to do a
recombinant DNA-based genetic screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken these isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's two from a patient with IPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only nine non-synonymous
high-impact SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between these two,
this was a home run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my new student's project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Gillian will appreciate this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mutation is an LEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the H-morph strain has a lot of
loss of function allele of LEA,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a methyltransferase, Nancy Keller
originally discovered many years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: that regulates secondary metabolism and
fungal development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's the parent strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with the allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the strain that evolved in the patient,
we lose this LEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a stop codon that causes a
premature stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do all the necessary and
sufficient allele swaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the parental strain that we
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with in the lab often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our control strain, our H-morph
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a mutant of AF293 from Nancy's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's H-morph, which we went back and
looked at her picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in her paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's the allele from the
patient that we put back into the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's non-functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you take the clinical strain
that has the loss of function allele and
[SPEAKER_01]: you put the wild type allele back in,
we can completely restore the colony
[SPEAKER_01]: morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good one because it gives us
a genetic regulator we know something
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea here now that this is
potentially an epigenetic regulator of
[SPEAKER_01]: that metabolic switch, which is cool
because in cancer, a lot of the regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Warburg effect is done through
epigenetic modifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early days on that, but pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of finish up, I've showed
you that these H-morph strains are
[SPEAKER_01]: important in progressing disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lab artifact.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're happening out in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing is that these H-morph
strains have this metabolic rewiring
[SPEAKER_01]: that's driving glycolysis and reductive
carboxylation, we think, that really
[SPEAKER_01]: drives cell wall homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that in that context, these strains
become fit in low oxygen environments and
[SPEAKER_01]: then are able to cause disease and damage
to the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think with that, I will finish
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to show you the drug
resistance stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll just skip the drug resistance
stuff and stop with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if I'm understanding
correctly, wouldn't it make more sense for
[SPEAKER_03]: the wild type that evolved in the higher
oxygen environment to have colony
[SPEAKER_03]: morphotype that creates the low oxygen
environment to promote growth as opposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to the phenotype, the one that evolved in
the low oxygen environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Low oxygen creating that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wild type strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that has the less clear cut,
nice looking morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the answer is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I didn't show you is that those
H-morph strains are more sensitive to
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the wild type strain,
if you were to adopt that morphology as,
[SPEAKER_01]: so some of the furrowing we see we think
is a stress response to the oxygen that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason the wild type strains
haven't been selected for this in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is because of that oxygen
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our working hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take hydrogen peroxide,
it just nukes these H-morph strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think because as you reduce
electron transfer through the electron
[SPEAKER_01]: transport chain, you release a little bit
of ROS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these H-morph strains do that far
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've measured that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think when you have more oxygen
around, when you ramp that up,
[SPEAKER_01]: those strains would become more
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the lab, like a 5% fitness
defect, you don't think about or care
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out in the environment, that actually
is a huge disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my hand-waving answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice segue from that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see a difference either
transcriptionally or genetically in oxygen
[SPEAKER_04]: sensors, so like globin-like genes or
anything between the H-morph?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a globin-like gene in fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called fungiglobin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't scooped too many times in my
career, but that was one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gene is regulated by the
transcription factor that I started at
[SPEAKER_01]: SRBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so based on that data, someone pulled
it from our RNA-seq, and they published a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice paper on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really the function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a globin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likely binds oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't show that in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in bacteria, bacteria have a homolog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in bacteria, it's been well studied as
a molecule for grabbing oxygen and moving
[SPEAKER_01]: it across the different cytochromes in the
bacteria cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's likely doing something like that
in fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't see any differences in that
gene transcriptionally between our H-morph
[SPEAKER_01]: and H-morph strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Off of that, also, I'm curious with the
morphology of H-morph, H-morph strain,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you think that the horizontal growth is
just a lack of polarity overall,
[SPEAKER_07]: or is it directionally horizontal?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a postdoc who I'm super
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have an answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did his PhD in Rob Arkowitz's lab,
the cell polarity lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's super interested in that very
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also potentially have to do with
the cell wall not being able to support
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another model that we've thought
about, that the cell wall is weaker
[SPEAKER_01]: because it can't make as much heighten as
the wild type strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't get that vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the polarity question is very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're looking at your H-morph
strains, specifically in your capillomics,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you see any increased production of
other virulence compounds, like
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically leotards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the RNAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, do we see changes in
secondary metabolite production between
[SPEAKER_01]: H-morph and N-morph, like with gliotoxin?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with gliotoxin, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other secondary metabolism
clusters that are differentially regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: between H-morph and N-morph, and
definitely could be involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: virulence phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: That inflammation could be involved in
dictating how the colony organizing
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with the LEA result that we got
recently in front of ISIL.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a clarification, are the clinical
isolates, is it easier for the host to
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize it because there's no matrix
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely, both in vitro with
macrophages and neutrophils, when they see
[SPEAKER_01]: the H-morph strains, the cells activate
rapidly through a dectin-1-dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that I didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my students, the experiment to do
was to take dectin-1 knockout mice and see
[SPEAKER_01]: if that eliminated the virulence of the
H-morph strains, because we thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: all these neutrophils that were being
recruited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like plants, humans have evolved many
receptors for these fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we got rid of dectin-1,
we really didn't see any change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: progression of disease or the
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are known, there are other
receptors, there's a beta-glucan within
[SPEAKER_01]: the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the answer to your question is yes,
they definitely are recognized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done those experiments in the
lab, and it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take up to like 10 to one wild
type to one canidia of H-morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after three days, the whole colony's
H-morph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't done it in the mouse yet,
but we've done it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, I should show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do different, H-morph always wins
in the lab condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever done the evolution
experiment where you take your H-morph and
[SPEAKER_06]: just repeat it in high oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bring it up quite often in lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's yet taken me up on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to skip through the second part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, actually one piece of data here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug data, here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is boriconazole and amphotericin
B.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two antifungals we use in
the clinic to treat aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the biofilms as they
develop become completely resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: those drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are mutations in the targets
that have been discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are mutations in the drug efflux
pumps for the azoles that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered in clinical isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is a huge growing issue,
particularly with the agricultural use of
[SPEAKER_01]: azoles out in the environment that we,
the story in the field is that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for these target-based and
efflux pump-based mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick aside, since it was shocking
to me that there hasn't been any crosstalk
[SPEAKER_01]: between ag antifungal development and
human antifungal development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two haven't talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the story here, it's a sad story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, the azole story is one that's
emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second one is there was a new
antifungal in phase three clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called alloraphim, the D-H-O-D-H
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks great in the clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then out of the blue, it turned out
Monsanto had already developed it as an ag
[SPEAKER_01]: antifungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just released it last year for
use in the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the lab, all it takes is like two
passages on the Monsanto molecule to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop resistance in the target gene in
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's gonna happen to the human drug
is very unclear now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually failed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't fail the clinical trial,
but the FDA didn't approve it,
[SPEAKER_01]: in part because of the resistance issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's actually gonna happen there,
we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a great molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need more crosstalk between the two
different groups to make sure we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: targeting the same mechanism, given how
quickly these organisms develop AMR.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
