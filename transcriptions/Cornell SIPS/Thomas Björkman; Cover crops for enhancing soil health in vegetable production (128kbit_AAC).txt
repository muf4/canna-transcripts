[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't use my FM DJ voice today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a bigger microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I've talked about the Broccoli
Project here quite a number of times over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years, but I realized in this venue,
I haven't talked about my cover crop work,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I talk about it nearly every
week to some audience during the fall and
[SPEAKER_02]: early winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this would be a good chance and
especially as it impinges on the work that
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of you are doing and sort of
reinforce the connections that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: around some of these questions of
production and biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my big goal with the cover crop
work is to make vegetable production more
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally and economically
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find that everything probably
fits into that big picture and there'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of smaller threads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the work in cover crops when I
started was done for field crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And field crops are very constrained.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get planted in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you can get in the ground,
they get harvested when the weather starts
[SPEAKER_02]: to get lousy in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't make for a very exciting
cover crop scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetables are really different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some of the things that really
play into how you think about putting
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops into a vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing is that it's very high revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the plus side for somebody who's trying
to change practices is that if what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is useful, it's worth spending money
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are more likely to adopt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, if it messes things up,
it can cost growers a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also in some of the decision
making, getting the crop off the field is
[SPEAKER_02]: even more important because you can easily
have a situation that we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Field is too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crop is ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you have $10,000 worth of crop on
land that costs $5,000 an acre,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your call?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to go in there and rot it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible for soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to be the decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you end up with people doing things for
short term benefits that are bad for the
[SPEAKER_02]: long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetables compared to other crops produce
very little organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a need to supplement that with
other things in the cropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tillage is traditionally very intense with
vegetables compared to most other crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly compared to fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even better, bigger contrast than with
field crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk about the issues with
tillage as we get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very high fertility setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particularly when you're harvesting before
seed maturity, if the crop is still green
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing, it wants a high nitrogen
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're harvesting when there's high
nitrogen, you're leaving a high nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nitrogen management becomes quite
different from a field crop that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting at crop maturity when if you've
done it right, you've run the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen down zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are very diverse rotations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetable crop producer generally is
trying to harvest for as much of the
[SPEAKER_02]: season as possible so that you get paid
for as much of the season as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we can grow tomatoes great and
deliver all kinds of tomatoes the second
[SPEAKER_02]: week in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's all you got, you have no
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have harvest all season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for cover crops, that provides a lot
of different opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also creates the need for a lot
of different solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give examples of some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say here my motivation for really
getting into the cover crops in a big way,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing around with it before,
was Carol McNeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she retired a couple of years ago from
Cooperative Extension, but she was really
[SPEAKER_02]: key player in the soil health program and
really worked very hard at getting cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop adoption and especially important to
me, identifying very precise precisely
[SPEAKER_02]: what the needs of the growers were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where could I, in doing research in
this area, provide more information?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so finding that highest unaddressed
grower need.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a really good partner in making
sure I was doing something useful and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding how to develop a curriculum
of information that's useful to the
[SPEAKER_02]: extension educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not research reports, it's not a
little factor and a little factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here's a set of ideas, a set of
practices that you can actually learn and
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really important to my
development extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: And partnering with the soil health team,
you'll see that a lot of this is
[SPEAKER_02]: structured around soil health practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another kind of introductory
notion, there's something about our
[SPEAKER_02]: geography and kind of where my
partnerships have been in doing this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blue and green on here is those are
alpha salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the really high quality,
highly productive soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see they run across the Ontario
Plain over into Michigan quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Geneva and Lansing are really very
similar in many regards, quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: work with Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got that band and so having
Geneva right in the middle of that spot
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it convenient, not only because our
land is just like the farmer's land,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the farmers are right there to work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd say my work is intended to
influence the colorful areas on this map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these can be sort of takeaways if you
want some practical things out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I've tried to focus
on is making sure that the cover crop is
[SPEAKER_02]: matched to the management goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the growers really need to have
something they are trying to accomplish
[SPEAKER_02]: that is difficult to do with the other
tools that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing in a cover crop to do
biologically what they're having trouble
[SPEAKER_02]: doing with their other set of tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different cover crops do different things,
different times of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finding the right one and identifying
exactly what the management goal is
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes takes some shifts in thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one, it's really important to
reduce tillage if you want the cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: to do much good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that's become more
and more clear to me over the past 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you some examples of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So coupling with the reduced tillage and
vegetable program, Brian, they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really important work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so tying the two ideas in those two
programs together is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the cover crops, timing is really
critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually growers think about cover
crops, oh, I'll get it in when I get
[SPEAKER_02]: around to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't work any better for cover
crops than it does for other time
sensitive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I'll start off with soil health
because that's been a real organizing
[SPEAKER_02]: principle of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a place where you really have an
opportunity to have considerable
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the cynical statements about the
soil health report is that you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription for what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically, it's reduce tillage and use
more cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do I need the test if that's what
it's going to tell me?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it tells you which things to do,
what the specific management goal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are the soil health test report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the eight indicators,
four physical ones and four biological
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are typically coming out of the
report.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these can be addressed with reduced
tillage and cover crops in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with cover crops, it's really
different cover crops for each of those
[SPEAKER_02]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're related to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to dwell on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm just going to focus on the
aggregate stability one for today in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to squeeze everything in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So aggregate stability is the soil's
aggregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to kind of give you a picture of what
that can look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bad crumb here is what ground looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you till it a lot, don't put in enough
organic matter and drive on it when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are no crumbs in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no air spaces in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to break that apart,
it will break into big clods and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: break into the individual mineral
particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's unfortunately taken out of a
vegetable field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is good crumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is soil that was taken next to a
vegetable field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hadn't been tilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the hedge row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looked like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see those crumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work like little ball bearings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can break up the soil easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tills fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: These stick together because they're very
well glued together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That provides a lot more air spaces for
the roots to grow for respiration and for
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil biology to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of where those
aggregates come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we're working with
buckwheat, which was the first cover crop
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose to work with because we'd been
doing buckwheat grain stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the outside of the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the root hairs you see going
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see there's all kinds of the
mineral particles in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stuck together to different
extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the cool thing about this picture is
that it's the soil sheath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Margaret did to get this picture
was she pulled the root ginger really out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she washed it with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what's stuck to the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's happened is the root has
pushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water is coming out of the root,
kind of make that point, with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: mucopolysaccharides produced by the root
surface pushed out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that glues this stuff together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about as far as the water could
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it pushes a bunch of other things
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food for all the biology of the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the cool things about Cornell
is that there are at least a dozen labs
[SPEAKER_02]: working very hard on what's going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they like?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we have them do good things for
us?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's tremendous activity right here
about what's going on in this picture,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I find very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to lead to answers I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first set of experiments I'm going
to talk about, we're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: which cover crop would be most helpful for
improving soil health and aggregate
[SPEAKER_02]: stability in particular, which we're going
to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a bunch of cover crops
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have fine root systems, coarse root
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow at different times of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They secrete different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of just practical,
we want to move our aggregate stability
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at two main windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is after an early vegetable crop,
so that we'd be planting around the 20th
[SPEAKER_02]: of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for a mid-season cover crop,
planting around the 20th of August.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't worry about later than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the two timeframes that were of
most interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we put this experiment in where we
had the same cover crop for four off
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had different vegetables in each of
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after four years, how much change were
we able to produce?
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that it was unlikely we'd see
anything in one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went for four, planting the same
crop four times in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't want to push it any further than
that was enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looked at various measures of
soil health and crop performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to orient you a little bit,
this is from the soil health handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's good, bad, and terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with wet aggregate stability,
on a medium soil is the dotted line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want green, good, you want an
aggregate stability of at least about,
[SPEAKER_02]: so in the 30s here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the two fields I was using were down
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were about 18 and 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were definitely in the red zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were in bad shape, one worse than
the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, can we push them out
of the really bad zone, at least into the
[SPEAKER_02]: not so terrible zone?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're asking a lot of the cover crop at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also a fairly common situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is with the early summer cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two colored bars are the two
different fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one is with where we had
bare ground in the off season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just open fallow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the aggregate stability
values after four years with the basically
[SPEAKER_02]: current practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then use yellow mustard, buckwheat,
Sudan grass, annual rye grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are sort of in order of how big
the root system is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thinking that a bigger root system
might have a bigger effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we find is that there's some
hints, but nothing is really coming out as
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're getting an improvement of 1%
a year, to get up to 40 is gonna be a long
[SPEAKER_02]: haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if it's moving, it's not moving
very fast with these early summer ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: These three are only in the ground for
about two and a half months.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early summer is nice, because you get
the long days and warm temperatures of
[SPEAKER_02]: July and August to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Annual rye grass actually survives into
the spring, so it's working longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not moving this measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the late summer cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the bare ground first,
so that's the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we get to use more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got radish, yellow mustard,
and turnip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all crucifers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all dying sometime during the
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rye and triticale are rains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, annual rye grass is a turf
type, so it makes a finer sod root system
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rye one kind of looks tempting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very commonly used one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even with that one, I'm a little wary
of it, because triticale is almost exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we had something that was going
to be consistent, I would wanna see
[SPEAKER_02]: triticale up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're seeing in this highly tilled
system is that even cover cropping very
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressively for four years, it's really
hard to move the needle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're planning on doing a master's
degree, project, and starting from
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch, this may not be the type of
experiment you wanna do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the deal with the tillage here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were tilling to plant the crop,
and we were tilling to incorporate the
[SPEAKER_02]: residue of the crop and prepare the ground
for the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's quite a bit of tillage in a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a paper that is about to come
out from a colleague in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're working on a similar soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there they've done wheat and vetch as
their off-season cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this measures the infiltration rate
of water, which is pretty closely related
[SPEAKER_02]: to the aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they moved it from an inch and a half
with the fallow up to a little over two
[SPEAKER_02]: inches with the two cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since rains in that range are really
potentially problematic, that matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look what happens when you stop
tilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much bigger increase in the water
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do the cover crops do when you
stop tilling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Much bigger impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having five inches of infiltration would
be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of water that just goes into
the ground, doesn't run off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, this is after 34 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably something happened before 34
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that by 34 years, something
has happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Harold Van Esse's group has a trial
similar to this going on up in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're five years into it or
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's starting to get interesting
looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not going to pull away like this
for a few more years by the looks of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can we do to reduce tillage in
vegetables if we're going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of this effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: How should we be thinking of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of adding cover crops to overcome
the tillage thing, that's probably not the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to use cover crops to avoid the
need for tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thinking about what's going on
structurally in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our tilled soil when it's
reconsolidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we fluff it up to plant stuff,
but it has very little aggregate stability
[SPEAKER_02]: and structural properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it reconsolidates like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of the season, it's compacted
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we keep fluffing it up, growing stuff,
and having it fall together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it's hard to make progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does no till end up looking like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having a picture in your head of what
reducing tillage looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that I dug up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we're starting to get wormholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some root holes coming through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worms can go in where there's been a
bigger root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things are happening when the
soil is wetter than it is in this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that it's starting to
develop a structure where it can support
[SPEAKER_02]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can support your equipment,
but it's still perforated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the source of the air spaces is
really different than what you get when
[SPEAKER_02]: you do tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we're trying to drive for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting those root holes in there is
really important, and then leaving it
[SPEAKER_02]: alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over a long period of time,
10 to 34 years, is when you're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get so much perforation that it actually
starts to behave the way you want it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And choosing a cover crop to work with
this or to do that sort of thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example of different root
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is millet and sorghum, sudan grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the seedlings when they're
coming up, you can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look really alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you look at those root systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a fine root system with a lot
of surface area, millet's your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want really strong,
thick roots that can punch through a
[SPEAKER_02]: compacted soil, sorghum, sudan grass has
the thick roots that can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the choice is really important,
even though they're right next to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other in the seed catalog, and they look
alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to say, well, they're out of the
sudan grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get the millet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to match the cover crop
with the purpose that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't do this talk without showing
the aptly named tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're paid any attention whatsoever
to cover crops in this neck of the woods
[SPEAKER_02]: for the last five years, you will have
heard a lot about tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the rage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a neighbor farmer who plants
about 1,500 acres of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's field cropper, but it's working for
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what everybody notices is,
wow, it's a big old daikon radish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a big old 2-inch hole in the
ground, which is nice, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: actually that deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the dirt stops, that's really the
soil level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only going down a couple of
inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the action really is the little
taproots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have strong gravitropus,
and they keep trying to grow straight
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have rotated the picture to talk
about gravitropism, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking from above.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're a couple of millimeters wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple of millimeters wide to punch
a hole, that's big enough to get the worms
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big enough to get the beetles
through, the springtails, all the
[SPEAKER_02]: mesofauna, as it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can move around in the different
parts of the soil and open up the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: profile much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thomas, in the previous picture,
does the Sudan swargum, do those roots
[SPEAKER_05]: normally go down that deep, or is that
only because they were grown in a
[SPEAKER_05]: cylinder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the cylinder helps, no question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Sudan grass actually does have a
pretty strong imperative to grow downward.
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots have a lot of cues of gravity,
light, water, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things telling them where
it's worth putting more roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they prioritize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some things just naturally prioritize
gravity more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the radish is one that puts that
pretty high up on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Physical restriction is when they like to
turn sideways if they hit something hard.
And Thomas, is that daikon root
harvestable and commercially viable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you eat them?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're perfectly fine to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've eaten them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no problem there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the seed companies that sell
vegetable seed will sell you daikon radish
[SPEAKER_02]: seed at $175 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cover crop companies will sell you
pillage radish seed at $3 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let you guess what the vegetable
companies are going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not quite the quality that will
let you compete in the high-end daikon
[SPEAKER_02]: radish farmers market restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sales part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a perfectly good daikon radish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where I'm left on this tillage question
is how can cover crops aid reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of one example where
this is after harvest in the fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: planting rye in the between crop row
spaces and planting radish in the crop row
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rye is going to survive the winter and
provide a good cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: The radish is going to grow, open up the
rooting zone below the radish,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it's going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will have completely decomposed by
springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have a seed zone already formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not require any tillage at all or
it may require very, very gentle tillage
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rye can stay there until you're ready
for it to be done and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: terminate it with an herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the technologies that we have
now that I'm having a lot of fun with is
[SPEAKER_02]: the GPS steering so that you can plant
this with your GPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen 100-acre fields planted
absolutely dead straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eerie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the following year, you can come
in and plant your crop exactly where the
[SPEAKER_02]: radishes were, not half an inch over
exactly where they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the rye was killed early and
is mostly decomposed by the time you're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out the plant, you still hit it
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can come back to that spot the
following year and the year after that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, especially with broccoli,
if you use crucifers, do you build up your
[SPEAKER_04]: flea beetle population?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're asking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole rotation question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was whether with
crucifers, you have to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying over flea beetles to the
subsequent crop if you're growing a cold
[SPEAKER_03]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to choose rotation crops
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they are compatible in the
rotation sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further complicating your vegetable
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a specific challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a lot of constraints that come
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see this sort of thing as having
lots of promise for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did some trials this year where we
took these highly compacted fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did the deep zone tillage that
Anu's program has been working quite a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: on for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And planted beans, which are some of the
wimpiest vegetables out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did great first year out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea would be to just go cold
turkey on this middle zone and just stop
[SPEAKER_02]: killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do deep zone tillage in that part as
long as it needs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also use the cover crop so that that
tillage is more effective or could be done
[SPEAKER_02]: more gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is very much the direction I see
us going on soil health and cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intimately tied in with the reduced
tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to switch over now to some
questions that growers have to get
[SPEAKER_02]: adoption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their first question is, where can I
buy the seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other major question is,
when should I plant it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the time to match the cover crop to
the planting date, you need to get a fast
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have it during a part of the
season where it produces enough biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also need to have it during a part
of the season so it will not produce
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because cover crop seeds make wonderful
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we don't want those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having ones that die or can be killed
before they make seeds is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're day length and temperature
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be fairly predictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this slide is in every grower talk I
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you know how to farm,
you know how to get a fast start,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know how to get no gaps, and you know
how to kill things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to be successful with cover
crops, make sure you do those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're likely to do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to talk a little bit
about the fast start as the main part
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what a fast start looks like
with buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cover crop I'm going to talk
with in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may see it looks a little yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cotyledons are up on the fourth day
after planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: At three weeks, essentially full cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: At five weeks, time to kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the difference in color between
three weeks and five weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: That color change is dramatic and it's the
signal to kill buckwheat if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: cover cropping.
Unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that three weeks full cover that's
part of the smothering effect of cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: If weed management is part of your
program, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally speaking, you don't want
weeds in your cover crop anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the seeding rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeding rate on something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 60 to 70 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's 60 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this nice uniform seed placement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to find out when during our
growing season can you plant buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the fast start parameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're measuring ground cover at three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhat arbitrarily saying that 70%
ground cover at three weeks is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the number we're trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the horizontal line across
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three very different seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Produce some different curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in short, having it in May,
it's really too cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it grows slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the weeds during May plantings,
the early season weeds will beat the
[SPEAKER_02]: buckwheat pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get into June and July and
early August, it's looking good for a fast
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty long season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is getting enough
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here we're looking at the biomass
at 42 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when we would typically kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And June and July still look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get into August, there's an
abrupt drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, that's because it gets cold
in September and it stops growing in
September.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even though it came out of the ground
like a rocket because it was warm,
[SPEAKER_02]: and wet in early July, it slams on the
brakes once you get into September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the August plantings don't actually do
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the thing is, if you're busy,
this is crazy time of year for vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the end of July feels just like the
beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the difference between putting your
buckwheat in here and putting your
[SPEAKER_02]: buckwheat in there is the difference
between success and failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to hit the date right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a lot of data like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we developed a degree day model to
figure out when the planting date is that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get both a fast start and enough
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the climate centers,
we worked up a map for actually covering
[SPEAKER_02]: the Midwest as well for the last effective
planting date of buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that struck me about this map is
that if you look in the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see that the date zones,
the borders between the date zones,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much follow the interstates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can say, oh, it's this state if
you're north of interstate seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're trying to talk about New
York or New England, it's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: modeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need some sort of a local map or
something to tell you for a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: farm what are you going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that shows up pretty
clearly is that down here at Beltsville,
[SPEAKER_02]: where a lot of cover crop work gets done,
they're dealing with a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different situation, very different
timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also have worked a lot on the
crucifer cover crops, which we never use
[SPEAKER_02]: in broccoli production.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're popular for a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that they're cheap to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds cost the dollar to $3 or $4.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use five or 10 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seed cost ends up being relatively
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the amount of stuff you have to
bring out there is fairly low with the
[SPEAKER_02]: small seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rye you're planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 150, 200 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are in the similar range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine if you have a 50 acre
field, this is a lot of stuff you're
[SPEAKER_02]: hauling out and driving around the field
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the crucifers, it's a lot less,
much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the vegetable systems,
remember I said that you're harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: when the nitrogen levels are still really
high, both in the soil and the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are great scavengers of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're a good tool for soaking up
that excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And carrying it over to the next year so
it's not lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did some similar work with
mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is with Dan Brainerd at Michigan
State.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Kellogg Biological Station and
the Freeville Farm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both sites had certified organic land
that we could work on an organic funded
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And weed control in the fall is especially
interesting through organic growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here again, you can see that abrupt
drop from getting good biomass to getting
[SPEAKER_02]: very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, very, very abrupt window closing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there we developed the degree day
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the buckwheat model looks very
similar to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see in this model is that
there's a lot of degree days when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fairly quickly, it comes up and
makes however big it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they collect more degree days in
Michigan also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something we noticed
consistently that would usually catch a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in most locations, that rise happened
about the same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could do a model for that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have basically the same kind of map
but now developed for mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's thankfully a little bit simpler
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making statements about when to plant
the mustard cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tested a bunch of different
crucifers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all the same from the super
frost sensitive radish to the really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really cold hardy winter canola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though the winter hardiness
varies, the degree day requirement for
[SPEAKER_02]: growth in the fall is exactly the same on
all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last planting date applies to all
the crucifers, not just mustard.
It's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another step along for helping the
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is with Edie O'Neill and Brian
Belcher with Cornell Climate Smart
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming, which you can find a bunch of
tools at climatesmartfarming.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing really nifty stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is one of us a set of tools
that they have that's tied in with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop decision tool that I've put
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you pick your location,
so not everybody gets Ithaca, you can put
[SPEAKER_02]: your farm, your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a big farm, you can put different
fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are at different elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've got this for mustard,
rye, and buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, what's the probability of
success?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I define what success is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will show you the curve of your
odds of success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you mouse along there, so I have
the mouse on August 31st here,
[SPEAKER_02]: it tells you you have a 27% chance of
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the history since 1978.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years?
[SPEAKER_02]: There were enough growing degree days by
that planting date.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people like to gamble more than
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gives you the exact, how risky is
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the scary part to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dark line here is the 15-year average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gray line is the 30-year average.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it counts another 15 years back in
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that difference represents how much
warmer the last 15 years have been than
[SPEAKER_02]: the previous 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows up throughout the Northeast,
all the locations we've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows up to different extents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the cover crops that have
different degree day models shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're providing growers with tools
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though they're targeted pretty
narrowly to New York vegetable growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a huge group in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets used 50 to 100 times a day
year-round.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the adoption is quite high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been pretty rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's show a little bit about weed
suppression, which is another management
[SPEAKER_02]: goal, not soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the fast start, so you want the cover
crop, buckwheat here, come up faster than
[SPEAKER_02]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this picture, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I saw this, I'd say, whoops,
let's try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is a trial we did with buckwheat
with the question, how much tillage do you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually need in order to get a buckwheat
cover crop established effectively enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to suppress the weeds for the rest of the
growing season?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is after a pea harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they come off fairly early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this, the green is the buckwheat
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange are the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come up in the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yellow is the weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how much weeds were there if we
didn't have a cover crop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with no till, you can see that the
weeds grow just as happily as they would
[SPEAKER_02]: have otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the buckwheat doesn't really grow very
well because it has such a fine root
[SPEAKER_02]: system that this straight no till,
it goes into ground that's too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are germinated weeds present
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But disking enough to just kill the weeds
and provide a little bit of a seedbed,
[SPEAKER_02]: now you get pretty good buckwheat growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get pretty good suppression of the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's planted immediately after
tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rule of thumb is wait a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're violating that rule clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a chisel treatment also in case
there was going to be puddling,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that turned out not to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's essentially the same treatment
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially the same results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we waited a week,
so the buckwheat actually liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did get great weed suppression
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did it a couple of other years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to see some weed
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wait the two weeks, this is
actually weeds that have now germinated by
[SPEAKER_02]: the time you plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not getting a fast start
relative to the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having that much weed biomass is
actually worrisome because it's in your
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be going to seed later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though it's not a real big bar,
it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're saying is after you've
harvested a vegetable, you need enough
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage to kill weeds, get a seedbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant the cover crop right away to
maximize the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried it later in the fall with the
mustard system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here the line is how big the cover
crop was.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue bar is the weed pressure,
how many weeds were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the red ones are how much it is with
mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see a big difference between the
blue bar and the red bar, that means the
[SPEAKER_02]: mustard was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so early in the season when the
mustard is big, you're getting some weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: suppression, but also some significant
weed growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing we're finding is when we go
late into the season, we're not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: great weed suppression, but we're getting
a lot of weed suppression even when the
[SPEAKER_02]: mustard is really small in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some good competition happening
right away when the mustard comes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground and is competing with those
weed seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not so much in those seedlings,
but it's about the growth afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we ask the questions,
are specific weeds being suppressed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can easily think that the cover crop
targets certain weeds and not other weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at just all weed numbers
that come up after you've incorporated the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop, we're finding that it's
essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 100% means there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we compared mustard and no mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for something like lamb's quarters,
we're seeing a reduction by half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not great, but helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we tested a high glucosinolate
mustard against a low glucosinolate
[SPEAKER_02]: mustard, thinking that this is the
biofumigation effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the West and other long season areas,
they do biofumigation with mustards that
[SPEAKER_02]: are high in glucosinolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is to try to assess how big is the
effect of biofumigation versus all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other effects that the cover crop has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we found no difference ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought is that biofumigation isn't
really what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to worry about that in
our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we go to a couple of other weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they like mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mustard stimulates their germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can go either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of others that we were
worried about had even smaller effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not seeing super dramatic
specific effects here on the weeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: come up after the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to skip that one and go to
take home messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you're thinking about the cover crop
work that I'm doing, how it impinges on
[SPEAKER_02]: your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about using cover crops to assist
your efforts to release tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're studying the effects of
cover crops, it's helpful to look at it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the context of your production system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the things I talked about
here, we came up with a different answer
[SPEAKER_02]: from the place where that system was
originally developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our constraints are different,
the answers are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to be useful to the
audience locally here, you need to test it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the system with the constraints that we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding the mechanics, like the
biofumigation I just showed on the last
[SPEAKER_02]: slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding something about the
mechanics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the transition into no tillage
work?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you getting the higher
infiltration rates, for instance?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to repeat, fast start,
no gaps, kill on time, seven words.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got those words?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember, nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fitting the cover crops into the
production system in as many places as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible to try to achieve that year round
roots that are going to keep feeding that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil biota that's so interesting and we'll
all be learning more about in the few
[SPEAKER_02]: years to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing this work, I've collaborated
with a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a ton, or I think it comes to
about a ton and a half of collaborators
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been particularly involved in
this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I'll wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we grow garlic and then put the
buckwheat on after the garlic,
[SPEAKER_04]: rotate it with something else next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often don't kill our buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like, OK, well, we're saving
the tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are the benefits or the
disadvantages of not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't really have a weed
problem with buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we losing nitrogen and organic matter
by not killing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is killing on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So garlic is pulled out fairly early in
the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have time to plant buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buckwheat grows up nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different root system and
disease profile from the garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It suppresses the weeds for the rest of
the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot more than 42 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OK, it's flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't get killed on time the way I
described it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what Donna also said, we don't really
have a problem with weeds, presumably
[SPEAKER_02]: buckwheat, being in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of your management is taking
care of the weed seedlings that result.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cultivates really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people don't worry about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in your case, killing on time is
whenever the frost gets them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a no tillage system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the springtime, you have good
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you lose nitrogen that you put back
in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with buckwheat, you probably do lose
nitrogen over the season because it will
[SPEAKER_02]: decompose a lot during the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as it remains protein into the
spring, it's likely to stay in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it decomposes to the point where
you have nitrates or even amino acids to
[SPEAKER_02]: some extent, the nitrate will denitrify
any time you have saturated soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you will have guaranteed some time
before planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also leach out if there's leaching
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the amino acids will also leach out the
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's trying to keep it from
decomposing too much before springtime is
[SPEAKER_02]: the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buckwheat is going to decompose long
before springtime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long does it take to get the seed
from buckwheat?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 42-day thing is actually very
closely related to that because you start
[SPEAKER_02]: getting viable embryos very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, and a lot of the times,
if you kill buckwheat by mowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's little branches that are left with
the seed heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll actually sit there and mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can produce quite a lot of
seeds from those while they're
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposing.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the rest of the plant is
decomposing, the seed are maturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though it would typically be 70
days until you harvested commercial seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: killing it at even 50 days, you're likely
to get seeds out of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty touching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if you could maybe talk a
little bit about this idea of how
[SPEAKER_06]: spatially distributed those compaction
occur.
Are we talking like, is there generally
uniform compaction?
And how does the mechanism of these roots
growing out through there actually break
it up?
Are you just kind of punching a hole
through it and shoving the soil to the
[SPEAKER_06]: side, which kind of re-compacts the soil
laterally, or does it get in that way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the structure of the compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a couple of compaction tools
that we use a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the moldboard plow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it goes along, it's actually lifting
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big heave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the counteracting force is pushing
against the soil downward with plowshare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is where the plow pans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's at all moist down there,
and here it's usually moist down there,
[SPEAKER_02]: that creates a pretty uniform compaction
plow pan that will be uniform across the
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be thicker where the soil was
wetter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are wetter spots in the field,
which is typical of our fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our other tool is the disk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at a much shallower level,
but it scours as it goes across.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can make this nice glossy area just
below the seed, a couple of inches down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come down and hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for having the cover crops grow
through, it's really the lower one,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plow pan I think you're thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, they would be pushing sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been compacted vertically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ultimately, you would want to be moving
the soil up and having the air spaces take
[SPEAKER_02]: up that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the only direction you
can push.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually, it will get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as the roots go through, yes,
they are pushing radially around the
roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like these roots maybe aren't
necessarily completely eliminating
[SPEAKER_06]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're perforating the compaction is
how I think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Thomas again for a
wonderful lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
