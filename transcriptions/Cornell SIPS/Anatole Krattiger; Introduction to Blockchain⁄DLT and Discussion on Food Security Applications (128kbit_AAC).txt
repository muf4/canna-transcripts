[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of an experimental
lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time I'm talking about
blockchain and food security, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I started working my way into
about six, eight months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I looked into it,
the more I got absolutely excited and
[SPEAKER_00]: imagination got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do in the next 41 minutes
is, with 75 slides, so bear with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to provide you a broad, basic
understanding of what blockchain is and
[SPEAKER_00]: what it isn't, get you excited with lots
of applications that are growing up
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere from all directions,
and then end up with some fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I think that we will need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as a society, but also I think a
scientist will need to think about and
[SPEAKER_00]: grapple with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to dispel some myths,
give you a few essential elements that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think are really important to understand
blockchain, give you a plethora of current
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through very quickly, including on
food, agriculture, and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and philanthropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as I said, some questions,
and hopefully we'll have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, five myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blockchain is all about Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin, you've heard about it,
price went up, price crashed, price goes
[SPEAKER_00]: up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Bitcoin, when Bitcoin started,
it has been a seismic shift in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: computers, in fact, can talk to each other
and execute programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes this so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another myth is Bitcoin uses more
electricity than Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not necessarily be a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, it's not really a
problem because Bitcoin is just the first
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are already so many follow-on
innovations that are coming that radically
[SPEAKER_00]: change the business model and that use
very, very little electricity or computing
[SPEAKER_00]: power for the same transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give some examples on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of cryptocurrencies,
Bitcoin, currency encrypted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain, is fictitious, it's imaginary,
it has no relationship to reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that may be true, but it's basically
about the use of these tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back later to what the token
and the cryptocurrency is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a certain truth to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there can also be a direct link with
fiat currency, there could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there could be a direct link with
something solid, something real,
[SPEAKER_00]: like your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on the value, Amazon, you wish you
had invested, or your parents had
[SPEAKER_00]: invested, even $10 only, or $100,
and look where it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often forget that many companies that
were completely changing the paradigm look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the share price at the dot-com bubble
of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many people lost complete
confidence, this is not going to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole, well, same with Bitcoin,
it's gone up, it's come down, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely nothing unusual what we
are seeing today to what we are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with historically with any new paradigm
shifts in technologies, Amazon as an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hear that cryptocurrencies enable
criminal activities, money laundering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they can, and yes, they are
safeguards that are being implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: through regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing unusual, you can take a
suitcase of cash and pay somebody to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just makes this easier on the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in essence, it's nothing unusual about
a tool that you can use for dual purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps over time, blockchain will be,
or cryptocurrencies will be the least
[SPEAKER_00]: likely ones to be used for criminal
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a subject that would take us
too far to go into why I think that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, Satoshi Nakamoto, you may have heard
of him, he is, or her, or she,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they are the ones who wrote a white
paper that became Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A white paper is to describe the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely a watershed moment in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whoever that person or persons are,
we don't know who he, she is, stood on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were many precursor technologies
that were essential to enable his
[SPEAKER_00]: groundbreaking or her groundbreaking
invention of Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, others, as you see a
theorem hash graph, are becoming almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: if not even more game changer than Bitcoin
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is blockchain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using blockchain and distributed
ledger technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synonymously, they're not quite
necessarily the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be, but you hear distributed
ledger or blockchain fall practically for
[SPEAKER_00]: different purposes, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about ledgers, lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, ancient from Giza, from the
pyramid of Giza.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a list of items.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're familiar with your lab notebooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in fact a ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The date, what you did, what came out of
it, how you did it, what you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's a ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bank account, a ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much you have, how much you spend,
where it went, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it started with your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your mother gave birth, the hospital
wrote down in a ledger the date,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, the name, the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you lose your birth certificate,
you have a little problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In future, this will all be on the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can no longer lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just distributed on the internet,
sorry, distributed across computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're familiar with the centralized
nature of the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go shopping on amazon.com to take the
same example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to central Amazon server in the
cloud, but still it's an Amazon-owned
[SPEAKER_00]: server and transactions happen between you
and the third party and your credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Amazon is really decentralized now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloud service all over, but it's still
owned by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this different with blockchain is
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no more central authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of them gets corrupted,
gets infected, is operated by a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: gang, or is suddenly inoperative because
the country closes off the firewall,
[SPEAKER_00]: the system is resilient and continues
happily to live thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Byzantine general's
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This alone would take an hour's lecture,
but in a nutshell, what blockchain does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it solves this particular problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's assume you have in this case two,
four, six, eight, 10, 11 generals with
[SPEAKER_00]: their own armies surrounding Byzantine
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't communicate by radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 years ago that wasn't invented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to send messengers to the
others at what time on what date will we
[SPEAKER_00]: attack and are you in or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if everybody agrees on that particular
time and date, they all attack and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are bound to take over the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not the case, if one of them
fails or lies or is a spy, then if one
[SPEAKER_00]: general or one army doesn't make it,
they will all get killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you solve this problem when all
you can do is send a message to others
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, I'm going to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Messenger comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't know if that general is
lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if that general sends a
different message to somebody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the big problems in
computers, databases, security,
[SPEAKER_00]: since the invention of the internet in
fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: What blockchain, what Bitcoin,
Satoshi Nakamoto did solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others tried before with elements of it,
but the real breakthrough was again
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin and it's cryptographically solved
and mathematically solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave it at that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point that I said earlier up to a
point is if more than one third of the
[SPEAKER_00]: generals are spies, then you're out of
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a limit to how many can be bad
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're in the city,
of course, the spy is a good guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all practical purposes, if you want to
attack, you can only do with one third or
[SPEAKER_00]: less that are bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise the system really doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a fairly formidable threshold,
especially when you have thousands or
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of computers around
one blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes pretty nearly impossible,
not completely impossible, but nearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an essential concept that has
been solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another concept to understand is the
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see these long strings of numbers
and letters that represent underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of you in the DNA sequencing,
you're familiar with how do you compare
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA sequences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not by comparing billions of pairs,
but by using hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hash is a series of letters,
numbers, that represents a series of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: database, DNA CGTAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the example here is John Smith,
there's a hash function, and John Smith is
[SPEAKER_00]: 02.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 02 represents John Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't deduct from knowing 02 that
it's John Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, you need the cryptographic keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there can never be a hash that is
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's another John Smith,
that John Smith, because it's uploaded on
[SPEAKER_00]: a different time, different place,
gets a different hash, all that is
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded in the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so big stuff becomes much smaller and
can be transmitted through the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very fast in nanoseconds.
Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several ways of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: With public and private keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may be familiar with that,
if you have an RSA stake or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there's a direct function because
the 02 cannot represent anything else but
[SPEAKER_00]: John Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need the entire key, the public
and the private to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, this is one layer of security which
makes blockchain enormously hacker-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, there have been no hacks of
exchanges, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's different to the blockchain
itself having been hacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no known hacking that has yet
occurred and not likely to occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else to understand, very
briefly, is the consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do all these nodes, all these
computers come to a consensus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it the following way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give birth to John Smith in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets into the ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then distribute it to all the
computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that John Smith gets a hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do all the computers, the thousands or
hundreds of thousands of computers,
[SPEAKER_00]: agree that this is really the right hash
for this John Smith?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, either the computers do some proof
of work, a lot of computations,
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical computation, hence power
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there is a proof of stake where if they
have a certain stake in a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: platform, they are the ones that solve it,
that solve certain mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptographic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then validate that yes, this entry is
the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody then agrees that this is a
nose, that this is the only John Smith
[SPEAKER_00]: born by these parents in that hospital at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you have databases,
especially when they are distributed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't have one that is slightly
different to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who you SharePoint here,
Cornell, to upload your data, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you have synchronization errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the issue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the blockchain solves by making
it impossible that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: synchronization error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one is what I mentioned over lunch
with the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two types of blockchains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm soon ending with the key concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is permissionless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any accreditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy bitcoins, trade with bitcoins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of permissioned ones
where you need an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be accredited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be allowed to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to abide by the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, you're thrown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or pay penalties and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two systems both can exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethereum is in fact both, depending on the
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state of the technology is maybe
early 90s, mid 90s when the World Wide Web
[SPEAKER_00]: just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you weren't born by that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea how life was before the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go to an actual library and look
up cards and go and look for books to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are early in that development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what the future holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the fascinating thing
about it, what the future could hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last concept is smart contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smart contracts are nothing else but an
algorithm, again, a what-if-then function.
[SPEAKER_00]: A computer program that says if I sell you
through a blockchain a book, you give me
[SPEAKER_00]: bitcoins or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say it's a permissioned
application where we both are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may not know who you are, who each
other is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are on that blockchain,
on that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't upload within,
say, 24 hours proof of shipment of the
[SPEAKER_00]: book that I bought or that I whichever way
around, then the smart contract says,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, he did not upload on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, he is going to refund twice the
amount that the other one paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a simple what-if function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can embed those functions and
dispute resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything can be written in code that
accompanies certain transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think of buying a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put money in escrow, you get title
search, you get documents certified by
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers, a mortgage, pay down,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes ages and meetings and lots of
money goes to lots of middlemen and
[SPEAKER_00]: middlewomen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with blockchain and the first half,
houses have been sold on the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, somebody has to upload the
title and certify that the original title
[SPEAKER_00]: that was uploaded on the blockchain is
authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that first step needs to be done once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's a lien on the house,
if there's a mortgage, if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong with it, it's all on the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be verified by the buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something were wrong, the smart
contract would then take care of some
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties in whatever way that particular
blockchain has written the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a couple of minutes or a
couple of hours and all is automatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, not everybody likes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Amazon wasn't liked by bookstores and
it changes the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not whether or not it's liked,
but how fast will new lines, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with new applications like in
plant breeding, for example, that may make
[SPEAKER_00]: certain technologies that we know today
completely obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of minutes, a couple of
seconds on summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's decentralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to trust a particular
computer or particular player,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the system is the one that gives
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have trust in your credit card bank,
bank that issued your credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your money there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have trust implicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is now done online where this
did not exist before blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a smartphone, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You request a transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into that cyberspace there with
these computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing their number crunching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come up with a consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different ways of
consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only gave two, proof of stake,
proof of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, it's a proof
transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into the block and it's there
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can never, ever be changed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tamper-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't later change and change for the
document.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other person gets confirmation on
their smartphone within minutes or
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, depending on the system you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very last concept to briefly touch on is I
used words, coins, tokens, and
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptocurrencies so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually simple, the difference,
but actually very, very difficult in
[SPEAKER_00]: practice because there's so much overlap
of the two concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coins or cryptocurrencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cryptocurrencies are money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's money in the cyberspace that may or
may not relate to something real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dollars or houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tokens are more used in permission chains
for transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most tokens have to be purchased with
coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in one minute, that's a good
definition I can give off the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: For practical purposes, think of the coins
more like money and the tokens more like
[SPEAKER_00]: fungible ways of transacting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airline miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fungible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get a token in the future and
you can use it for airline miles or to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers for your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we stand today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it's really early, but we're
already in the version five probably of
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain, depending on with whom you
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bitcoin got the whole financial
industry, fintech, really going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethereum, a 20 year old guy started that
with smart contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now the most ubiquitous way of doing
blockchains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apps, I won't touch on it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has now seen early industrial use
applications and lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_00]: new technologies are invented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashgraph that may once again
revolutionize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't dwell into it, but I can strongly
urge you to look at this description by
[SPEAKER_00]: the inventor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolutely beautiful new type of
blockchain if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashgraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is Bitcoin, you have a
couple of thousand transactions every five
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Hashgraph, you can have 250,000 and
more per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can layer them and have
500,000, 1 million, 10 million
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of Visa processing, your credit
card processing, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already being developed by Hashgraph,
by Swerill, the company for Visa in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have hundreds of thousands of
transactions a second where this will all
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually be done paperless on the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terminals in the shop, you won't even
notice the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may one day just put your smartphone
there as you do with WalletPay,
[SPEAKER_00]: ApplePay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will all be done by blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to current 23 minutes and
I might, wow, one minute ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get through the 75 slides,
don't worry, because the next ones will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the different areas I'm going
to cover very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The row on the left and then spend a bit
more time on the food production and food
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can you buy stuff using
cryptocurrencies or coins or altcoins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Altcoins, by the way, are normally
referring to not being Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are just some examples and
there are hundreds more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy pizza, you can buy beer,
you can buy a flight into space on Virgin
[SPEAKER_00]: Galactic with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will talk about open bazaar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first one I want to show is
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Switzerland, so you can already
buy rail tickets using Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ID, you see the ID here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your application, you take the
photograph, like the barcode, just the ID,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you buy your train ticket with
Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that already exists since 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are quite ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I find this pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open bazaar was on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open bazaar is something, a permissioned
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say this anymore because most of
the applications are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set up an account, you get accredited,
you buy tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I now sell my book on open bazaar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody on the other side of the world
can buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No transaction fees with foreign
currencies, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the way I described earlier with the
book, there is a way of doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: seamlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could potentially disrupt Amazon's
business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon, when I sell a book on Amazon and
I'm selling some through a nonprofit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take 45% of the sale price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a company, it takes 55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here it'd be a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest applications today,
industrial scale, is in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply chain management that are
enormously cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think of shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft and MySQL have developed already
a prototype where all the documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: for insurance, for cross-border,
for destinations, content, taxation,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is on the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is executed automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The container arrives in the port,
scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truck loads it, scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes through custom, scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ends up in Walmart, scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy it, scan, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of some insurance companies in
Asia tried across eight jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have insurance across countries,
it's enormously paper and regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many checks and double checks and
putting it into a data base and another
[SPEAKER_00]: company, a different data base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes about four months to settle
an insurance claim between Hong Kong and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the insurer in Hong Kong issues a
policy to a company in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an incident, it takes four
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that blockchain prototype that they
did, it took four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few people will lose their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that have to check and put paper in
for the copy, scan, classify, and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefit is, of course, that everything
will be faster and essentially foolproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as foolproof as the blockchain's
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most advanced is Everledger for
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the point of mining, photographed,
all the way to the sale on your wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: ring, all on blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are millions of diamonds already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are cut, that gets recorded in the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a few numbers on fraud
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 billion are estimated in the diamond
industry to be lost to fraud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that can be prevented with
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most fraudulent claims go undetected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rest my case there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in future, you'll buy the wedding ring
diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know the miner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see the face on your phone,
on your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know that it's not a blood
diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributed cloud storage, another
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rent out your computer,
your laptop, for others to store their
[SPEAKER_00]: files if you have space left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make some money along that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't read, again, encrypted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cryptographically, essentially foolproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: BitTorrent, those that are familiar with
BitTorrent, similar system to BitTorrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same is in many different
computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one is down, you still have access to
your files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Fintech, I think the
conclusion on Fintech is somebody from
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley high up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our belief at Berkeley is that blockchain
is a fundamental part of the new operating
[SPEAKER_00]: system for the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hear that central banks and
banks are against Bitcoin and blockchain,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, yes, until they figured out that
they could probably benefit from it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will fundamentally transform our way
of interacting with each other at every
[SPEAKER_00]: level of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcade City will take over Uber maybe one
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uber takes quite a cut, central authority
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcade City, you have drivers,
you, me, again, permissioned blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a fraction of the cost to me or to
you, the rider, will completely change the
[SPEAKER_00]: way we do transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just for taxi type of transports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of parcels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of distribution of the postal
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind-boggling if you just dare to think of
the potential implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Renting, it's just finished its ICO.
[SPEAKER_00]: RentBerry, that's for long-term rentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airbnb will be history maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some medical applications
and process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tracking the origin of the medicines all
the way to bedside from bench,
[SPEAKER_00]: from production to bedside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of what it means for vaccines,
where every storage has been monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it too long at room temperature,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fraudulent medicines, fakes, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tremendous technology to all but
eliminate that completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another medical application is,
or health research application,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a professor at MIT just started
recently a blockchain where you put up
[SPEAKER_00]: your DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it sequenced, gets on the
blockchain, and if companies come and
[SPEAKER_00]: steal your DNA or compare or fish out
certain sequences, you actually get paid
[SPEAKER_00]: per view, so to speak, with tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gem, managing medical records.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of many that are already
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will revolutionize the health
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that fact alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then imagine what you could do if you
superimpose AI, artificial intelligence,
[SPEAKER_00]: machine learning, having access to some of
those medical records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get tokens, by the way, if they pay
per view along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know who you are, but now
suddenly you have everybody who's on that
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain, their medical records could
now be mined for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay casinos now, you can gamble on
the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an advantage, it's not stacked
against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to gamble, it's always stacked
against you, the yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house always wins at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the zero coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make a little bit of money with
the transactions, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fair gambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suggest you try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you examples, but you can
then think further what this could mean
[SPEAKER_00]: for democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you walk home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings me to governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dubai.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get the whole state,
everything on blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All public records, your identities on
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the transportation will be managed on
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UK is still studying whether they
should do pensions, payments of pensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, fraud prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have other interesting
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voting one day will be on the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days ago, Arizona passed a bill to
allow tax payments with Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a hoax.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, here's what will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will buy something at Green Star or
Wegmans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will already, the blockchain through
which you bought it, will deduct all the
[SPEAKER_00]: right taxes, instantly almost transfer the
taxes to the right players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your income from Cornell or from wherever
will come through the blockchain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the smart contracts associated with
the blockchain will know how much taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: you are owed to pay to whom, by when,
will all be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: HR block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go into some fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philanthropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: BitGive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to know exactly what you're
giving, where it ended up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: to whom, by when, at what time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crowdfunding on the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kickstarter is history.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This developed by the Gates Foundation,
William Miller and the Gates Foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to enable the two point some billion
people that are not banking to have
[SPEAKER_00]: wallets and be able to actually have money
in their pockets and not to have to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: to another village with cash or a
transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's to empower the poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come to some agricultural
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many, I didn't know which
ones to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I selected a few random ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some for fun, some because I think they
are groundbreaking in their technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I've put first because I'm still
trying to get my head around what exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: their business model is, but it looks darn
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a bit more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, when you go to Green Star,
you can know exactly the provenance of
[SPEAKER_00]: each individual honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can also use it for whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which island, which island,
which farmer milled, did the rye and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that and where it was distilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will all see that on the blockchain
one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This probably is another one that is
really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have permission, of course you need to
have an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do is they already have
certain certifications that they provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's audited and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will reduce the cost of producing a
certified, let's say organic, trademarked
[SPEAKER_00]: products where you have collective marks
for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the only way things will be
sold in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it for developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly it's becoming easier for a
developing country farmer to participate
[SPEAKER_00]: because the transaction costs here are
minuscule compared to what they used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: using banks and shippers and importers and
exporters and storage and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the middlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Block grain in Australia, where payments
are happening almost instantaneously,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, on quality, a variant of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beef ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's real beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it means, but watch this
space, there will be vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I Googled and tried to find vegan
blockchains, I couldn't find any,
[SPEAKER_00]: except one that didn't take off,
but I found an interesting blog and the
[SPEAKER_00]: title was Cryptocurrencies Are Turning Me
Vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global cannabis chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see all the different functions
that this chain is integrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxation, of course, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fishermen in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You order fish on the plate tonight for
dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the menu is the barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You scan it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the fisherman.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the route he or she took.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was fished, how it was
transported, how much a fisherman got.
[SPEAKER_00]: At every stage, you know how much they got
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, you add a tip for the
fisherman at the end of your meal if the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provenance has it now in many
different sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about tracing, verification,
and trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim to be the blockchain of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm saying, there are many of those
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will become the ubiquitous Amazon
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day, the question will be how will
the different blockchains interrupt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the interoperability of the
different blockchains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inventor of Ethereum is writing a
white paper as we speak and promises to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to stretch your mind a little bit
more, Monsanto paid over a billion dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: for climate.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think of integrating that information
with artificial intelligence, machine
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, and blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just putting that out to stretch your
minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Monsanto bought paid a billion
dollars for the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are lots on IP,
but that would be a subject for another
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come back to a few forward looking
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the future price of Bitcoin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is now is a good time to
sell and I'll buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, joke apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the future hold at the interface
of distributed ledger technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain and artificial intelligence?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've alluded to it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think of breeding, phenotype,
screening, putting all that stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain and having a wheat breeder at
the other side of the world and artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence that makes sense of all that
data that comes together that no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: sits in God knows what different databases
and singers and singer or whatever it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it called for the DNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that will be on blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with artificial intelligence,
it will revolutionize breeding like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think molecular genetics has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: By when will blockchain make Airbnb and
Uber obsolete?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the writing is on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will blockchain applications be regulated
as public goods?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the quality of a perfect public
good, non-rival ring consumption and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-excludable.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least they're not the permissionless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that alone would be a couple of hours
to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will blockchain enable a Norwegian
future where the government controls
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from your birth certificate to
your income, to your taxes, to your
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't transport unless you have part
of a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for some reason they don't like you
or think you should be incarcerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: they turn off the switch and you can't
move anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very technology, Bitcoin,
that was supposed to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: decentralized, make governments and
central banks obsolete and take away their
[SPEAKER_00]: power, could one day be turned against
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just putting out food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the question for the
discussion, 42 minutes exactly,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we harness our institutions,
your minds, to actually use blockchain for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the good applications, bring different
values, different cultures together around
[SPEAKER_00]: a system that we can all understand,
address the sustainable development goals
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for evening lecture, a summary of
the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to spend 30 seconds on the
last one, on governance, with two
[SPEAKER_00]: examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what is the parallel to the
executive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judiciary is the miners that make sure
that come to a consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature is in fact the system that
was built on the platform itself and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we have all the users.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have fundamental questions,
how blockchain is going to fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: change the governance of corporations
because it changes the power structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: who has power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This professor by the way at New York
University is fantastic, one of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities on the economics of
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a sweet potato farmer in the Red
River Delta outside Hanoi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't asked her what she thinks of
blockchain, but that's worth the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
I understand how blockchain works very
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really like that value, the key value
pairing and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would try to do $10 as a very light
weight value.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to add my key multi-megabyte
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything related to your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The builders, the materials that were used
in the building, in the construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: the paints when it was renovated,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's real, actually that application
exists today and it has been solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been solved by, you don't need to
transfer all the information all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so you have to... Not much,
it's nanoseconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of packs and fourths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin is 10, 12 megabytes per block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethereum makes transactions much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashgraph is kilobytes for the same amount
where what you need to transfer all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time is proof that you are who you claim
you are and that you want to execute a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain transaction that is a certain
specified and allowed transaction and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the system then allows you to do the
transaction and transfer ownership title
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the transactions take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying data, you don't need to
transfer all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because you have it transferred once
and it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the blockchain is immutable,
unchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's in a block, it's unchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's it, it stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the data centers of amazon
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to pick on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, tetrabytes or flops, I don't even
know what the terminology is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much data goes across every
nanosecond?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, the energy goes into usage It's
useless mathematical processing actually
[SPEAKER_00]: for Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have it centralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: With blockchain, you will use less energy
to do the same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be transferred once and then
it's locally in one computer and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's immutable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with a particular code or
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked up that hash, I can see what
I want to see and get that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to get it from all the
million computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys will come up with those
answers and your minds will solve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the Mojo, the one that I
mentioned from Gates Foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they developed three years ago,
by the way, or four, is in fact intended
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop the infrastructure needed
precisely to connect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The antidote when you're willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it is descending upon us every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the concern is going to always
be that that is a co-optical system.
And we can look around the world and see
many places where it's such a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relative, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it takes us to another
subject, which is what is the limit of
[SPEAKER_00]: democracy?
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the people, what do we allow our
governments to actually do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same blockchain can be used either
to curb that power and make it really
[SPEAKER_00]: democratic or to bring that Ovalian
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the choice will be ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one slide on food safety,
the cost of false meat, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls with blockchain because you know
the provenance and every step and wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, you can't just add 50 more pounds
because that will be locked at the point
[SPEAKER_00]: of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, you can cheat, but you will be on
a permissioned blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have to have been accredited
to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you play bad ones, there will be
consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it completely foolproof?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But take the diamond, you take the picture
of the diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that picture and assuming it's not
from a blood diamond, but taken from
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else and then photographed here,
those things are always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the blockchain reduces and the
accreditation and the auditing that will
[SPEAKER_00]: go with it, that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduces that potential significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely, it doesn't eliminate,
doesn't put everybody, doesn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody honest overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for my own honesty, credits of
some of the images are downloaded from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
